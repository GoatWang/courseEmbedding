Etymology[edit]
The restaurant's name was taken directly from The Rolling Stones song, "Ruby Tuesday", which was popular during the time of the first restaurant's inception. The name was suggested to founder Sandy Beall by Bob Hope.[6][7]
History[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, August 2008



Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Etymology[edit]
The restaurant's name was taken directly from The Rolling Stones song, "Ruby Tuesday", which was popular during the time of the first restaurant's inception. The name was suggested to founder Sandy Beall by Bob Hope.[6][7]
History[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, August 2008



Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]




The former Ruby Tuesday logo and slogan, used until December 2006


In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]

Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Etymology[edit]
The restaurant's name was taken directly from The Rolling Stones song, "Ruby Tuesday", which was popular during the time of the first restaurant's inception. The name was suggested to founder Sandy Beall by Bob Hope.[6][7]
History[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, August 2008



Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Etymology[edit]
The restaurant's name was taken directly from The Rolling Stones song, "Ruby Tuesday", which was popular during the time of the first restaurant's inception. The name was suggested to founder Sandy Beall by Bob Hope.[6][7]
History[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, August 2008



Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]




The main entrance of Ruby Tuesday Inc. headquarters in Maryville, Tennessee, February 2012



In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]

Food That Is Not Fit for a Dog
By Pissed Off Customer - 04/26/2017

Rating: 1/51



FLORENCE, SOUTH CAROLINA -- NOTE: I contacted Ruby Tuesday's corporate headquarters regarding this experience I had at the So. Carolina Ruby Tuesdays. I even sent them a video showing the horrible food we were served. I was not looking for any kind of freebies nor even my money back - just asking that someone do something about the place. Over a month and I have heard nothing. SO - here I go.
My wife and I stopped at the Florence SC Ruby Tuesdays off I-95 on American Drive. My wife ordered soup. When it came she took one sip and said it tasted like chemicals. We sent it right back. I then realized that we would not enjoy our dinner there so I asked the waiter to wrap mine to go. I ordered a strip steak. When I got the steak, it looked as if someone put it on a grill and sat on it. It was cooked all the way through (I ordered medium rare) and it was tough as shoe leather. We took a video of the food. The baked potato had butter on it, but it would not melt because the potato was cold.
Since I have had family in the restaurant business, including my daughter, I realized talking to the manager would be a waste of time. Once in the car, we took a video and I sent it to the corporate headquarters asking them to do something about the restaurant. I explained that if I did not hear from them, I was going to post the video online. I have not heard anything, so this week I am going to post it. DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION.

Best Service I've Had
By Andrea - 09/08/2014

Rating: 5/51



GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY -- I'm from the Lima, OH area and only went to the Ruby Tuesdays on occasion because their staff usually wasn't friendly or the salad bar was borderline rancid! However, we are in the process of moving from Ohio to Georgia and decided to try the Ruby Tuesdays in Georgetown Kentucky. The food (including the salad bar) was amazing but didn't touch the server's hospitality. He made the whole experience enjoyable, we didn't have to ask for anything (unlike in Lima) and was willing to answer any questions we had and had no problem finding out answers he was unsure of!
Of course I raved about him to the manager who was just as enjoyable as his serving team who all greeted us with an actual smile! I'm a difficult person to impress when it comes to dining services due to almost 4 years working in the food industry and being a business major, however, I am completely blown away by their food, service, and hospitality!

Rancid Burgers!
By V. - 01/09/2012


MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA -- I was shocked by what was the WORST experience I have ever had anywhere, let alone Ruby Tuesdays at Eastchase Loop, Montgomery Alabama. I have eaten at your restaurants for years in various cities I have lived. I had come to rely on the consistency of the food and service quality that made anywhere I am feel "like home". Today the order was not taken correctly, took long despite that it was not crowded, I had to ask for refill on my drink despite the server seeing it was empty for about 15 minutes. But the worst part is that after all this I was served meat that was RANCID!! I threw up before I left and have been sick ever since.
I got home, threw up again and slept all day. I am so upset I cannot even express my anger and disappointment. My sister was with me and when I told her my burger was not good she smelled hers and backed away. I was very hungry when I arrived and by the time the food got to us I tried to eat it but less than halfway through I realized it was not me - the meat really was bad. My sister ordered the Minis and had not gotten to the meat part because its mostly bread on those but when she smelled mine, she lifted the bun on hers, took one sniff and put it down! 
It was disgusting. The texture was spongy, as if frozen and then improperly defrosted. It was not pink but I think that was not due to being cooked. It felt like the color was due to it being not fresh. The question it raises for me is about food handling at your restaurants. Is your meat frozen until ready to be cooked? Is it handled safely? Clearly the answer has to be NO judging from our experience and both of us having the same problem. This was at approx noon, it is now almost 11 pm and it's just now that I feel well enough to even write to you. 
The server and asst. mgr offered me another dish... as if I could even think of eating another bite in your restaurant. She said "I don't want you to leave hungry".... Trust me, leaving hungry was not possible. I have not been able to eat since that. I was even too sick to go to Pri-Med, which I considered because I thought I was food poisoned. Just writing to you is like reliving that horrible ordeal and sickens me to recall the odor and taste of the burger. 
We were not charged for our meals - thank you for not charging us for food poisoning! But I swear by all I hold dear that I will never eat at any Ruby Tuesdays again and will warn my friends and family about what happened to us today and the indications that the food handling at Ruby's needs to be looked into... A former Ruby Tuesdays customer.

Georgetown, KY needs to train their cooks
By Pendleton - 08/14/2009


GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY -- I eat at Ruby Tuesday in Lexington, Louisville and Georgetown often when I am on the road for work-related travel. I have always received service that is at least acceptable. But my last two visits to the Georgetown, KY store have guaranteed that I will never return to this location. I would not suggest this store to anyone that I know.
When I arrived at the door, I was greeted by a manager who suggested the bar area because of your new happy hour. So I was seated at the bar. Didn't like the happy hour choices so I instead ordered a ribeye. The food was brought to my table by the same manager who greeted me at the door (I think he said his name was **). 
When he sat my plate down, I could tell that the meat was overcooked, so I immediately asked him if my steak was medium rare as I ordered. He assured me that it was and informed me that the kitchen staff takes the temp of every steak before it is taken off the grill. When I cut into the steak, it was obvious that he did not know what he was talking about, because this meat was way past medium well.
When I brought it to the attention of my server, he immediately apologizes and takes the plate off my table. Within seconds, **, the manager, comes to my table, apologizes, and tells me he will get me another one, cooked fresh, and made to order this time. I watched him speak to the cooks. I overheard him tell them that this was the 4th steak in the last 15 minutes that had to be recooked. The cook, a Mexican man, immediately started to argue with ** and told him he had taken the temp of the meat and the steak was right the first time. I watched ** talk to him or at least two minutes before they finally listened to him and put another steak on the grill.
About 15 minutes later, another steak arrives at my table, delivered once again by **. He was very nice, offered me a discount on my meal for the trouble, offered me a free desert. I declined his offer and once again began to eat my steak. I cut into it directly in the center, and this time, the steak was more well done than the first one. Keep in mind, I ordered a medium rare steak that was medium well the first time, and has now come to my table well done the second time.
I carry the plate to ** and you can tell he is embarrassed by the mistake. He immediately apologizes and tells me if I am willing to eat the overcooked steak, he will take it off my ticket completely and that my meal will be free. I agreed.
But I then saw ** go back to the cooks and talk to them about the situation. Again, the cooks were not willing to listen to him and started sticking a thermometer into steaks sitting in the window to show the manager that they were cooked correctly. The cook touched three steaks in the window WITHOUT GLOVES ON!!!!!!!
While the manager seemed to be a hard worker and was very nice and willing to work with me on the problem, it was obvious he had no control over the kitchen staff. One cook had no hat or hair net on. Another cook that was sticking the thermometer into the meat in the window had no gloves on. Sitting at the bar, I saw this cook touch several pieces of hamburger and a couple steaks, without gloves on, then touches cooked meat without gloves or washing his hands. THAT'S NASTY!!!!!!
I was pleased with everything about this location except for the cooks' actions and attitudes. If I had been **, I would have fired the employee on the spot for the way he argued over the problem instead of trying to fix the problem. Everyone at the bar could see this take place, and I hope they also recognized the unsanitary way the cooks handle food.
Next time I am in the Georgetown area, I will eat at Applebee's up the road, or will spend the extra time and money to travel to Lexington, instead of giving my business to a store that had rude cooks who do not care about my health. I would suggest that anyone who read this do the same before these guys kill someone with their unsanitary conditions.

Ignorant and Moronic Management Accompanied by Terrible Food 
By Jubin - 05/13/2009


LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY -- I am the General Manager of the Hampton Inn & Suites in VERY closeness to the restaurant location listed above (11701 Bluegrass Pkwy Louisville, KY 40299). For a couple years now, the hotel has done business with the Bluegrass Pkwy franchise, and the Bluegrass Pkwy franchise had offered delivery service down the street to local hotels in the area. 
Recently some new idiot of a manager named ** had taken over I guess, this is the first dealing I have had with him, after several managers have failed there, and I guess he had decided to cut off the delivery service (which isn't a big deal) but to not tell anybody is ridiculous, especially when the staff says mixed things each time. So as the hotel refers customers down to the area, the manager out of all people is getting rude with my customers, saying they do not deliver with a terrible attitude, then I feel like we have a problem. 
When I called down to question the status of the delivery method from now on, ** the idiot, made no attempt at reconciliation, but went on the defensive, and after that nothing but ignorance came out of his mouth. Not only is he losing business for his company with the lack of personability, but he is looking like a moron to these guests, who will in turn not eat at another Ruby Tuesdays in their hometown wherever they may be from because of his terrible service and response, and he has lost the referral business of our property. 
When the delivery status changes, some days they do, some days they don't, it gets confusing; but yet again they do not post any times, nor do they give any effort to try to help, or notify any participating hotels, so why should we recommend this restaurant. Because of their lack of organization and consistency, the manager tries to displace his anger towards my guests is completely irresponsible, and not manager worthy behavior. I have officially told that manager, **, that as long as he is there, there will be no referrals for his business, as well as we will no longer carry any of the menus affiliated with that property until the manager ** gets his act together or leaves. 
I have notified my ENTIRE staff, to not participate with the Ruby Tuesday's, nor will we recommend, or even bring the name Ruby Tuesday's up in conversation other than to bad mouth the restaurant due to poor management and conduct. I have had issues with this property before, with the accuracy of the deliveries, now it is gotten to the point to where I have a bad taste in my mouth thinking about the restaurant, because of the service. 
For the manager to not try and fix the problem, or try and resolve the issue in a better manner, especially with one of the top occupancy hotels in the area is absurd, and almost shows how well the ownership really cares for their repeat business, which is not at all. We referred that property for deliveries, dinners, meetings, etc, but not anymore! Again until this matter is resolved, or I am contacted by somebody, this franchise on 11701 Bluegrass Pkwy will receive no support, or recommendations from this hotel, as well as others in the area who feel the same way about their service, and attitudes.

Ruby's Served Rotten Food
By ate rotten food at rubys - 11/07/2008


RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA -- First of all, I want to get this out and may take this public as well as lawsuit. I was served a steak meal at Ruby Tuesdays in Raleigh, NC on Dec. 26, 2005. With the meal included a rotten potato in which I did not know it was rotten. It was full of sour cream and butter and I could not see it was rotten. I usually eat a whole plate and this was the first thing I had eaten that day. 
My stomach began hurting before I could finish my meal. I had taken one last bite of the potato in which I could tell something wasn't right at that point. I began to move the sour cream and butter and found there was a black core through half of the potato and I had eaten more than half of it. My stomach was hurting and I already felt nausea. 
There were witnesses to the incident and the management was informed. The waiter came and promptly removed the meal and stated we would not be charged for the meal. The management did not come to the table to check on me and instead stated all they needed was information. On the way out, I promptly informed the manager that he was unprofessional and noted his lack of checking on the customer. His name is **. 
I went to the emergency room and was seen by a physician. I was given some anti-bacteria medicine and prescriptions for pain medicine. I was unable to get the prescription filled due to financial reasons. I called Ruby Tuesdays for their assistance in my medical treatment and was told their potato did not get me sick. THEY ARE CRAZY!!!!!! 
I would encourage the management staff at Ruby Tuesdays to order up a rotten potato and eat it and see how they feel afterwards. I've had stomach pain all week as one anti-bacteria pill did not kill all the germs. I called Ruby Tuesdays to ask some specifications on how the potato was cooked. I was asked in a rude manner if this was a joke and they could not give me any information. 
Later they did tell me it was cooked at 375 degrees in oven and not wrapped in foil. They went on to say that I would not get anything from this and they would not pay any medical bills. I'm still working on this issue but I wanted to let people know just how Ruby Tuesdays handles their customers. I know I will never dine there again. I'm also considering painting a vehicle with slogan "do not eat at Ruby Tuesdays, they service rotten food." They don't realize I am a consumer who will not stop until they admit their mistake. 
The cook should have caught that the potato was rotten when they cut it. Anyone reading this, if you know of a good attorney please let me know. Again, don't take your business to Ruby Tuesdays. Also wanted to add there were witnesses to the incident. 1/01/2006 10:34 AM.

Can't Complain. Only Compliment
By G. - 06/08/2016

Rating: 4/51



PORT RICHEY, FLORIDA -- We've been going to this location since it opened. Love their menu, lots of different choices to make. Love the salad bar too. We very rarely have a complaint about anything at this location. The wait staff is friendly and nice. Food comes at a reasonable time especially when eating the salad bar first. So after seeing all the complaints in different parts of the country, I felt I had to write about my location. Also, ate in the Winter Haven location last week (next to LegoLand) and had a wonderful dinner with the same friendly service.

The Complimentary Biscuits Were Sad, Hard and Dry.
By nannie - 01/07/2016

Rating: 2/51



MARYLAND -- The biscuits were sad and the fries were so hard, I couldn't eat them. I asked if they had been fried a second time and the waitress said no. Most of them stayed on my plate, I wouldn't even take them home to my dogs. Ruby Tuesday better keep sending out coupons to get the people to come in. My daughter who was dining with me got the monster burger. It was black on top, they over fried it. I've eaten in some nice places and I know good food when I see it.

To the LIAR "666" LADY who left a false review of the Louisville KY Ruby Tuesday
By RTisAmazing! - 08/11/2010


LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY -- There was a "customer" that came into the Ruby Tuesday on Blakenbaker Pkwy in Louisville, KY, and she seemed like a normal customer... with the exception of over-asking for little extras. It was fine. I even interacted with her grandson, was VERY nice to him, because well, she was just rude and walked in with a chip on her shoulder from the get-go. I even spoke to my manager before I even placed her order, letting him know that I had a feeling she was going to try to get free food. Her actions were diva-like, and unacceptable. Even though I KNEW this, I still gave her EXCELLENT service.
Her and her grandson ate everything they had, and when it was time to give her the bill, the total was $6.66. I know what that number represents in religion, however, Ruby Tuesday isn't a gas station, we can't just add a penny to make a different total. As she gave me the payment for her bill, she stated to me, "Don't expect a tip, you need to read your bible, you don't even know what that number means."
I was BLOWN AWAY. I replied, "That is NOT acceptable, and I'm getting my manager to take care of you." I went and got my manager, he came out quickly and tried to talk to her about her ticket, but she was rude to him as well, and kept cutting him off. He kindly asked her to leave, to which she did.
To my surprise, I come on HERE, and see that this woman left a FALSE statement about what happened that day on here... wow, the only thing I have to say to this woman is- "GROW UP... and don't EXPECT a company to take care of your bill because you don't like the total! LOL Using your religious beliefs to get out of paying is blasphemy!!! You should be ashamed of yourself! And for your information, I DO know my bible, which is NONE of your business, thank you very much! I hope you learned your lesson, and you don't pull this somewhere else. My manager did the right thing in asking you to leave, we DON'T want customers like YOU in our establishment."

Ruby Tuesday Inc. (NYSE: RT) is an American multinational foodservice retailer that owns, operates, and franchises Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The concept was started in 1972 by Samuel E. (Sandy) Beall, III.
The corporation was formed in 1996 as a reincorporation of Morrison Restaurants Inc. They are headquartered in Maryville, Tennessee, and have 736 locations worldwide.[1]
Their flagship brand is an American cuisine casual dining restaurant chain that is primarily located along the eastern coast of the United States. In 2016, Ruby Tuesday sold the rights to the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill to an undisclosed buyer in an attempt to refocus on the main Ruby Tuesday brand.

On June 6, 2012, founder and CEO Sandy Beall announced he would be leaving the company.[4][5]

Etymology[edit]
The restaurant's name was taken directly from The Rolling Stones song, "Ruby Tuesday", which was popular during the time of the first restaurant's inception. The name was suggested to founder Sandy Beall by Bob Hope.[6][7]
History[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, August 2008



Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant.[citation needed] With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972.[8][9] The location was adjacent to the University's Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed.
Over the subsequent decade, Ruby Tuesday extended their footprint with a new location opening about every nine months. In April 1982, Sandy sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock.[9] The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday.[3] By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations, and was a major contributor to the renewed success of Morrison's.[9]
Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of their restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned their dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group.[10] That same year, Sandy was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc.[9] On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison's approved a distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison's Fresh Cooking Inc.
Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama.[11] At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella's Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia's Tex-Mex.[9] In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (with the exception of Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand.[12] On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.[13]
Restaurant themes[edit]




The main entrance of Ruby Tuesday Inc. headquarters in Maryville, Tennessee, February 2012



In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay.[14] The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building.[15] The company's 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.[3]
In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin & Ray's Seafood & Sunsets concept.[16][17] As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:[18]



As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin & Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.



The company has also experimented with conversion with the Alabama-based Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company's first Jim 'N Nick's, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that particular concept.[19] On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash.[20][21] The announcement by Sandy Beall went on to add, "John Kunkel, Lime's founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.[22]
In 2013, after posting a second quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday decided to close 13 Marlin & Ray's restaurants and its one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also decided to seek a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and close two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.[23]
Headquarters[edit]




An international Ruby Tuesday in Telford Plaza, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, June 2009.



In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U).[12] These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company's executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.[6]
The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the area is currently used to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.[24][25]
Distribution[edit]
Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.[10]
As of June 2, 2015, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 44 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, United Arab Emirates, Panama, and the United Kingdom.[26]
Marketing[edit]
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites.[27] By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed "TueGo!".[28][29]
New identity[edit]




The former Ruby Tuesday logo and slogan, used until December 2006


In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand's customer perception out of the "bar-and-grill" segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed "Ruby TueGo" carryout service.[30] Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.[6][31]
Ruby Tuesday CEO Sandy Beall touched on the transformation in his letter to stakeholders in the company's 2007 Annual Report:[32]



Elevating Ruby Tuesday above the crowd to a memorable, high-quality dining experience is critical to our growth and success. We are engaged in a three-year plan to reposition, reinvent and reinvigorate the Ruby Tuesday brand. We began by bringing our guests fresh, exciting new menu choices, then raised our standards of service, and are now creating an innovative new look and style for each and every restaurant. This revitalization will appeal to our loyal core guests while attracting a new generation of consumers.



"Implosion"[edit]
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over "live" streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final "old Ruby Tuesday" to cap off the brand's commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd's shock, the "restaurant" next door (Cheeky's Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.[33]
Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company's website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the "live" event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.[34]
Changes continue[edit]
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night.[35] Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company's actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.[36]
In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.[22][37]
In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees' uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children's menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.
To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child's meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.
Sponsorships[edit]




A Ruby Tuesday location near the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia, July 2011



From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.[38]
In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.[39]
NASCAR[edit]
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[40][41]
Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.[42]
In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski's car.
Menu[edit]




Ruby Tuesday in Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood, January 2006



Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation.[6][43] All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine.[44] The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling "Cultivate Wines".[45]
A separate menu is available for placing a bulk take-out or catering order.[46] On January 25, 2012 the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company's catering sales.[47]
The executive chef for the chain is Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand's long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.[6][28]
Dietary concerns[edit]
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus.[48] After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the "Smart-Eating" section (currently labeled as "Fit & Trim").[49] Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.
Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy "skinny" cocktails.[50] This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their "under 150 calories" tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.[44]
Cookbook[edit]
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011 titled Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home[51] It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.[52]
Restatement[edit]
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.[53]
Restaurant closings[edit]
In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it will close 95 restaurants as sales slide. All employees from the closing locations will be laid off.[54]
