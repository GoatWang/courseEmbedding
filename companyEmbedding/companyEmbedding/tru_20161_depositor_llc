WAYNE, N.J., Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- In connection with its previously announced CMBS financing, Toys"R"Us, Inc. (the "Company") today announced that TRU 2016-1 Depositor, LLC (the "Depositor"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has priced $512,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-TOYS (the "Certificates"), representing beneficial interests in a trust fund consisting of floating-rate first mortgage loan obligations of Toys"R"Us Property Company II, LLC ("Propco II").  The sale of the Certificates is expected to close on November 3, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.








The Certificates will represent interests in and obligations of the issuing trust and will not represent the obligations of the Company, the Depositor, Propco II or any of their affiliates.  The Certificates will consist of six classes of floating rate certificates, each with an assumed final distribution date occurring in November 2019 and an assumed extended final distribution date occurring in November 2021. The approximate initial weighted average interest rate of all six classes of certificates is one month LIBOR + 487bps.
Propco II intends to use the net proceeds of the mortgage loan funded through the CMBS financing, together with the net proceeds of $88 million of mezzanine financing and other available cash, to fund the previously announced redemption of its 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "Notes").  The Notes are expected to be redeemed upon the closing of the sale of the Certificates on November 3, 2016.
The offer and sale of the Certificates have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any applicable state or foreign securities laws, and are being offered (A) in the United States only to (1) qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) other institutions that are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and any entity in which all of the equity owners are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, or (B) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Certificates or any other securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Forward-Looking Statements 
All statements that are not historical facts in this press release, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, among others, the seasonality of our business, competition in the retail industry, changes in our product distribution mix and distribution channels, general economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we conduct our business, consumer spending patterns, birth rates, our ability to implement our strategy including implementing initiatives for season, our ability to recognize cost savings, implementation and operation of our new e-commerce platform, marketing strategies, the availability of adequate financing, access to trade credit, changes in consumer preferences, changes in employment legislation, our dependence on key vendors for our merchandise, political and other developments associated with our international operations, costs of goods that we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, domestic and international events affecting the delivery of toys and other products to our stores, product safety issues including product recalls, the existence of adverse litigation, changes in laws that impact our business, our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations, restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements and other risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in our reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which reports and documents should be read in conjunction with this press release). In addition, we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal buying patterns and these buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. We believe that all forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions when made; however, we caution that it is impossible to predict actual results or outcomes or the effects of risks, uncertainties or other factors on anticipated results or outcomes and that, accordingly, one should not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments unless required by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from anticipated results or outcomes discussed in any forward-looking statement.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

Composite Score:





                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 33 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

EX-99.1
Exhibit 99.1 
TOYSRUS ANNOUNCES PRICING OF CMBS FINANCING 
WAYNE, NJ (October 25, 2016) In connection with its previously announced CMBS financing, ToysRUs, Inc. (the
Company) today announced that TRU 2016-1 Depositor, LLC (the Depositor), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has priced $512,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
Series 2016-TOYS (the Certificates), representing beneficial interests in a trust fund consisting of floating-rate first mortgage loan obligations of ToysRUs Property Company II, LLC (Propco II). The sale of
the Certificates is expected to close on November 3, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.  The Certificates will represent interests in and
obligations of the issuing trust and will not represent the obligations of the Company, the Depositor, Propco II or any of their affiliates. The Certificates will consist of six classes of floating rate certificates, each with an assumed final
distribution date occurring in November 2019 and an assumed extended final distribution date occurring in November 2021. The approximate initial weighted average interest
 rate of all six classes of certificates is one month LIBOR + 487bps. 
Propco II intends to use the net proceeds of the mortgage loan funded through the CMBS financing, together with the net proceeds of $88 million of mezzanine
financing and other available cash, to fund the previously announced redemption of its 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the Notes). The Notes are expected to be redeemed upon the closing of the sale of the Certificates on
November 3, 2016.  The offer and sale of the Certificates have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), or any applicable state or foreign securities laws, and are being offered (A) in the United States only to (1) qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) other institutions
that are accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors within the meaning of
Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, or (B) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell
or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Certificates or any other securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

All statements that are not historical facts in this press release, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are forward-looking statements.
These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, among others, the seasonality of our business, competition in the retail industry, changes in our product distribution mix and distribution channels, general economic
factors in the United States and other countries in which we conduct our business, consumer spending patterns, birth rates, our ability to implement our strategy including implementing initiatives for season, our ability to recognize cost savings,
implementation and operation of our new e-commerce platform, marketing strategies, the availability of adequate financing, access to trade credit, changes in consumer preferences, changes in employment legislation, our dependence on key vendors for
our merchandise, political and other developments associated with our international operations, costs of goods that we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, domestic and international events affecting the delivery of toys and other products to
our stores, product safety issues including product recalls, the existence of adverse litigation, changes in 



laws that impact our business, our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations, restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements and other risks, uncertainties
and factors set forth in our reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which reports and documents should be read in conjunction with this press release). In addition, we typically earn a disproportionate part of our
annual operating earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal buying patterns and these buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. We believe that all forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions when made;
however, we caution that it is impossible to predict actual results or outcomes or the effects of risks, uncertainties or other factors on anticipated results or outcomes and that, accordingly, one should not place undue reliance on these
statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments unless required by the Securities and Exchange Commissions
rules and regulations. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from anticipated results or outcomes discussed in any forward-looking statement.

Devel





Posted October 25th, 2016 for Toys "R" Us 






Printer-friendly versionWAYNE, NJ (October 25, 2016) In connection with its previously announced CMBS financing, Toys“R”Us, Inc. (the “Company”) today announced that TRU 2016-1 Depositor, LLC (the “Depositor”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has priced $512,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-TOYS (the “Certificates”), representing beneficial interests in a trust fund consisting of floating-rate first mortgage loan obligations of Toys“R”Us Property Company II, LLC (“Propco II”). The sale of the Certificates is expected to close on November 3, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Certificates will represent interests in and obligations of the issuing trust and will not represent the obligations of the Company, the Depositor, Propco II or any of their affiliates. The Certificates will consist of six classes of floating rate certificates, each with an assumed final distribution date occurring in November 2019 and an assumed extended final distribution date occurring in November 2021. The approximate initial weighted average interest rate of all six classes of certificates is one month LIBOR + 487bps.
Propco II intends to use the net proceeds of the mortgage loan funded through the CMBS financing, together with the net proceeds of $88 million of mezzanine financing and other available cash, to fund the previously announced redemption of its 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the “Notes”). The Notes are expected to be redeemed upon the closing of the sale of the Certificates on November 3, 2016.
The offer and sale of the Certificates have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any applicable state or foreign securities laws, and are being offered (A) in the United States only to (1) qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) other institutions that are “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and any entity in which all of the equity owners are “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, or (B) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Certificates or any other securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Forward-Looking Statements
All statements that are not historical facts in this press release, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, among others, the seasonality of our business, competition in the retail industry, changes in our product distribution mix and distribution channels, general economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we conduct our business, consumer spending patterns, birth rates, our ability to implement our strategy including implementing initiatives for season, our ability to recognize cost savings, implementation and operation of our new e-commerce platform, marketing strategies, the availability of adequate financing, access to trade credit, changes in consumer preferences, changes in employment legislation, our dependence on key vendors for our merchandise, political and other developments associated with our international operations, costs of goods that we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, domestic and international events affecting the delivery of toys and other products to our stores, product safety issues including product recalls, the existence of adverse litigation, changes in laws that impact our business, our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations, restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements and other risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in our reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which reports and documents should be read in conjunction with this press release). In addition, we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal buying patterns and these buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. We believe that all forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions when made; however, we caution that it is impossible to predict actual results or outcomes or the effects of risks, uncertainties or other factors on anticipated results or outcomes and that, accordingly, one should not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments unless required by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from anticipated results or outcomes discussed in any forward-looking statement.
