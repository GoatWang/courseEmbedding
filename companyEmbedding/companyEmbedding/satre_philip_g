Philip G. Satre Chair




























skip to main content

















































Philip G. Satre Chair
Due to the unique contribution of gaming to Nevada's history the College of Business has long been an important venue 				 for training for all aspects of the industry, including professionals in accounting, marketing, management, information 				 systems, finance, and economics. The Gaming Studies Endowed Chair position will further ensure that our gaming programs 				 and scholarship will be led by a top quality researcher who will continue to direct gaming education and research to 				 address the realities and research needs of this dynamic global industry.
In honor of Philip G. Satre's contributions to Harrah's and the gaming industry the Harrah's Foundation pledged $1 				 million in 2004 to the endowment of the Philip G. Satre Chair in Gaming Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno. 				 "During his 25-year careers with Harrah's, Phil has had a profound and enduring impact on this company and our industry," 				 said Gary Loveman, Harrah's president and chief executive officer. "His vision helped casino gaming grow from its roots 				 in Nevada into a nationwide industry, enjoyed and accepted by tens of millions of Americans. And his leadership propelled 				 Harrah's from a small casino company into the world's largest gaming corporation. This endowment is an appropriate, 				 enduring way to recognize his remarkable legacy.
"Additional individual contributions to the Satre Chair endowment fund were made by: Claudine Williams, chairman of the 				 board of Harrah's Las Vegas; Steve Wynn, chairman and CEO, Wynn Resorts, Ltd.; Chuck Mathewson, through the Charles N. 				 Mathewson Foundation; Jack Binion, founder of Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corp.; Steve Bollenbach, president and CEO of 				 Hilton Hotels Corp. and chairman of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.; Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels; 19 members 				 of Harrah's senior management team and members of Harrah's board of directors" (Harrah's Press Release, November 17, 				 2004). Dr. and Mrs. Gary Loveman were major contributors to the endowment fund. "Corporate contributions were made by 				 International Game Technology, Boyd Gaming Corp., Caesars Entertainment, Deutsche Bank Securities, Latham & Watkins, 				 LLP, Mandalay Resort Group, MGM Mirage, Station Casinos, Inc., Southern Wine & Spirits, Tracy Locke and TBC Public 				 Relations."
