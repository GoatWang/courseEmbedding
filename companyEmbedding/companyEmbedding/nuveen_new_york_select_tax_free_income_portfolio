							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, call risk, state concentration risk, tax risk, and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Credit risk refers to an issuers ability to make interest and principal payments when due. Below investment grade or high yield debt securities are subject to liquidity risk and heightened credit risk. The Fund's use of inverse floaters creates effective leverage. Leverage involves the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original investment and also increases the Fund's exposure to volatility and interest rate risk.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.



RISK CONSIDERATIONS
					Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This Trust is concentrated in the computer and technology sector. There are certain risks specific to computer technology stocks such as volatile stock prices, rapid product obsolescence, and speculative trading. This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs. Non-U.S. investments involve additional risks, including currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity and differing legal and accounting standards. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 
					 
					Although this Trust’s life is approximately 15 months, the Trust’s strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider, in light of their particular financial situations, whether it may be appropriate to invest in successive trust portfolios, if available, subject to the applicable sales charges. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor.

					NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

					Nuveen Securities, LLC, a registered broker-dealer, serves as the Trust’s sponsor and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC serves as the Trust’s evaluator and supervisor. Zacks Investment Management serves as the portfolio consultant responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for the Trust and is not affiliated with the Trust’s sponsor or its evaluator and supervisor.

Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.  There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objectives.  An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them.  Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.

The liquidity feature for this fund’s VRDP is being provided by Citibank, N.A. The VRDP shares comply with the requirements of IRS Notice 2008-55, as extended by IRS Notice 2010-03, and qualify as equity for income tax purposes. This affords VRDP share dividends the same tax treatment as the income on the fund’s underlying investments, notwithstanding VRDP terms that require the fund to redeem VRDP shares still owned by the liquidity provider if there are six months of continuous, unsuccessful remarketing.

Nuveen and TIAA-CREF Partner to Offer Three New UCITS to Non-US Investors | Business Wire
























































Nuveen and TIAA-CREF Partner to Offer Three New UCITS to Non-US 
      Investors





        New ESG Strategies Managed by Recognized Leader in Responsible 
        Investment
      

        Emerging Markets Debt Strategy Provides Exposure to a Broad Spectrum 
        of EMD Securities
      






October 19, 2015 03:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nuveen Investments, a leading global provider of investment services to 
      institutions as well as individual investors, today announced it has 
      extended its portfolio offerings to non-U.S. investors with the 
      availability of three new UCITS strategies featuring the investment 
      expertise of TIAA-CREF Asset Management (TCAM). Sub-advised by 
      TCAM’s Teachers Advisors, Inc., the new strategies are offered via 
      Nuveen Global Investors Fund plc through a UCITS structure.
    

      Respected for its decades-long leadership in the responsible investment 
      space, TCAM will manage two ESG strategies that include a global equity 
      ESG strategy and a U.S. bond ESG strategy. Additionally, TCAM will 
      manage an emerging market debt strategy.
    

      The TIAA Global Equity ESG strategy seeks a favorable long-term 
      total return that reflects the investment performance of the overall 
      global stock market while giving special consideration to certain ESG 
      criteria. The evaluation process favors companies that demonstrate ESG 
      leadership in their respective sectors, including impact on stakeholders 
      such as employees, communities, customers, suppliers and the environment.
    

      The TIAA U.S. Bond ESG strategy seeks a favorable long-term total 
      return through income and capital appreciation while giving special 
      consideration to certain environmental, social, and governance criteria. 
      The strategy invests in a broad range of publicly traded Investment 
      Grade bonds and fixed income securities including U.S. Government 
      securities, corporate bonds, taxable U.S. municipal securities and 
      mortgage-backed or other asset backed-securities, subject to ESG 
      criteria. Additionally, the strategy invests a portion of its assets in 
      fixed-income instruments that reflect proactive social investments. 
      These investments provide direct exposure to issuers and/or individual 
      projects that have clear and measurable social or environmental benefits
    

      The TIAA Emerging Markets Debt strategy seeks a favorable 
      long-term total return, through income and capital appreciation, by 
      investing primarily in a portfolio of emerging markets fixed-income 
      investments. It typically invests the majority of its assets in 
      fixed-income securities issued in emerging markets countries, including 
      corporate, sovereign and quasi-sovereign fixed-income securities with 
      ratings of B- or better, but it may also invest in lower-rated bonds.
    

      Since its founding in 1898, Nuveen Investments has been committed to 
      delivering high quality investments services. Nuveen takes a long-term 
      perspective in managing portfolios; and through its multi-boutique model

These investments provide direct exposure to issuers and/or individual projects that have clear and measurable social or environmental benefitsThe TIAA Emerging Markets Debt strategy seeks a favorable long-term total return, through income and capital appreciation, by investing primarily in a portfolio of emerging markets fixed-income investments.  It typically invests the majority of its assets in fixed-income securities issued in emerging markets countries, including corporate, sovereign and quasi-sovereign fixed-income securities with ratings of B- or better, but it may also invest in lower-rated bonds.Since its founding in 1898, Nuveen Investments has been committed to delivering high quality investments services.  Nuveen takes a long-term perspective in managing portfolios; and through its multi-boutique model of independent institutional asset managers, offers an array of actively managed and index-enhanced investment products designed to balance expected returns (alpha) and risk, to help achieve the long-term financial goals of our clients.  Providing a UCITS framework represents an important step in the firm’s measured approach to offering high-quality investment strategies in a product structure preferred by many institutional and retail investors throughout Europe, South America, and Asia.  For non-U.S. investors looking to learn more about Nuveen’s UCITs offerings, visit www.nuveenglobal.com or www.tiaa.org/UCITS.About Nuveen InvestmentsNuveen Investments provides high-quality investment services designed to help secure the long-term goals of institutional and individual investors as well as the consultants and financial advisors who serve them.  Nuveen Investments markets a wide range of specialized investment solutions which provide investors access to capabilities of its high-quality boutique investment affiliates—Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC, Tradewinds Global Investors, LLC, Winslow Capital Management, LLC and Gresham Investment Management LLC, all of which are registered investment advisers and independent investment subsidiaries of Nuveen Investments, Inc.  Nuveen Investments operates as a separate subsidiary within TIAA-CREF, which is a leading provider of retirement and financial services in the academic, research, medical and cultural fields.  In total, Nuveen Investments managed approximately $230 billion as of June 30, 2015.  For more information, please visit the Nuveen Investments website at www.nuveen.com.  About TIAA-CREFTIAA-CREF (www.tiaa-cref.org) is a national financial services organization with $834 billion in assets under management (as of 9/30/2015) and is the leading provider of retirement services in the academic, research, medical and cultural fields.About TIAA-CREF Asset ManagementTIAA-CREF Asset Management (www.tiaa-cref.org/public/assetmanagement) is part of the TIAA-CREF group of companies and provides investment advice and portfolio management services to individual investors, intermediaries and institutional clients through its subsidiaries.
