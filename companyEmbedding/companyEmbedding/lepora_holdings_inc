NOTE 1
– NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

 

Lepora
Holdings, Inc. (formerly Event Hill Acquisition Corporation) (the
"Company") was incorporated on December 11, 2015 under the laws of
the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate
undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and
acquisitions. The Company registered its common stock on a Form 10
Registration Statement filed pursuant to the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act) and Rule 12 (g)
thereof on January 7, 2016, by which it became a public reporting
company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a
foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company
with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

 

On
December 11, 2015, the Company issued to the founders (two officers
and directors) 20,000,000 shares of its common stock at par value
of $0.0001 per share at a discount of $2,000. On May 27, 2016, the
Company issued 5,000,000 new shares of its common stock pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 at the par value of
$0.0001 and redeemed 19,500,000 shares of the then outstanding
20,000,000 shares issued to the founders, thereby, effectuated a
change in control of the Company. The new majority shareholders
elected new management of the Company. The Company plans to develop
its business plan by future acquisitions or mergers but no
agreements have been reached regarding any acquisitions or other
business combinations. If the Company makes any acquisitions,
mergers or other business combinations, the Company will file a
Form 8-K but until such time the Company remains a shell
company.

 

Since the
change in control, the Company plans to develop China and Asian
markets for the sale of products which are designed to improve air,
water, health and the home environment. The products include
ParadisePURE water filtration systems which reduce pollutants
produced by industry, agriculture and nature including chlorine,
chloroform, herbicides, pesticides, lead, silver, arsenic, chromium
and mercury and over 50 volatile organic compounds. ParadisePURE
water filters also remove unpleasant odors and cloudiness and makes
water better tasting while retaining naturally occurring beneficial
minerals essential for good health. Other products include the
ParadisePAD "health pad" which is intended to provide beneficial
and enjoyable home therapy and comfort through the application of
infrared waves, soothing heat, and hot micro-stone
therapy.

 

The
Company believes that the demand for these products will be strong
in the target markets in Asia where much of the water is polluted
and air pollution commonly reaches dangerous levels and consumers
are becoming increasingly health conscious.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below are
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently
applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP were omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016.

 

NOTE 2
– SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The
following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company
is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s
financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the
representation of the Company’s management who is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. The financial statements of
the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

 

USE OF
ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

CASH

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not
have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

 

INCOME
TAXES

 

Under the
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, "Income Taxes,"
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are
established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016,
there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the
realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to
expiration.

 

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

 

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution, and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

 

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial
statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted
guidance for fair value measurement related to non-financial items
that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited
condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The
guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

HOLDINGS, INC.

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

 

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

 

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

 

The
Company’s financial instruments consist principally of
accrued liabilities payable to a related party. Pursuant to ASC 820
and ASC 825, “ Financial Instruments” , the fair
value of our accrued liabilities to a related party is determined
based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets.

 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

In January
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 Income Statement
Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of
Extraordinary Items. The objective of this Update is to simplify
the income statement presentation requirements in Subtopic 225-20
by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. Extraordinary
items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their
unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence.
Eliminating the extraordinary classification simplifies income
statement presentation by altogether removing the concept of
extraordinary items from consideration. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-220 Income Statement Extraordinary Items (Subtopic 225-20),
which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2015, a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A
reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to
all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early
adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from
the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is
the same for both public business entities and all other entities.
Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on
the Company's financial statements.

 

On April
30, 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master
Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260,
Earnings Per Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the
two-class method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the
general partner, limited

partners,
and incentive distribution rights holders each participate
differently in the distribution of available cash. When a general
partner transfers (or "drops down") net assets to a master limited
partnership and that transaction is accounted for as a transaction
between entities under common control, the statements of operations
of the master limited partnership are adjusted retrospectively to
reflect the dropdown transaction as if it occurred on the earliest
date during which the entities were under common control. The
amendments in this Update specify that for purposes of calculating
historical EPU under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of
a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction
should be allocated entirely to the general partner interest, and
previously reported EPU of the limited partners would not change as
a result of a dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about
how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the
dropdown transaction occurs also are required.

 

This
Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed
Accounting Standards Update EITF-14A Earnings Per Share Effects
on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership
Dropdown Transactions (Topic 260), which has been deleted.
Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is
permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied
retrospectively for all financial statements presented. Management
is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the
Company's financial statements.

 

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17- Income Taxes .
The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to
reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification
Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to
identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted
accounting principles for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this
standard.

The FASB
issued ASU 2016-02, “ Leases” (Topic 842) . ASU
2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities
that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the
statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments
(the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its
right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases
with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an
accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition,
lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at
the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach. Nonpublic business entities should apply
the amendments for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019
(i.e. January 1, 2020, for a calendar year entity), and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
Early application is permitted for all nonpublic business entities
upon issuance. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the
adoption of this standard on the Company’s financial position
and results of operations.

 

The
Company has implemented all accounting pronouncements that are in
effect that might have a material impact on its financial position
or results of operations.

 

NOTE 3
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date
and has sustained operating loss of $6,121 and $9,978 for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had a
working capital deficit of $9,371 and an accumulated deficit of
$11,290 as of September 30, 2016. The Company's continuation as a
going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining
additional financing from its stockholders or debt financing or
sale of its stock, as may be required.

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to do so. The unaudited condensed
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

In order
to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will
require additional working capital from either cash flow from
operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company
currently has no commitments from any third parties for the
purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire
additional working capital, it will be required to significantly
change its business plans.
