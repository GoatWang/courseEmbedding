Product Description
When the Levees Broke (DVD)One year after Hurricane Katrina decimated New Orleans, director Spike Lee presents a four-hour, four-part chronicle recounting, through words and images, one of our country's most profound natural disasters. In addition to revisiting the hours leading up to the arrival of Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane before it hit the coast of Louisiana, When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts tells the personal stories of those who lived to tell about it, at the same time exploring the underbelly of a nation where the divide along race and class lines has never been more pronounced.]]>

Director Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke is the definitive document of the unmitigated disaster that was, and is, Hurricane Katrina. It's also a contemporary manifestation of an ancient tradition: an oral history, told by the people who lived it, with no narration and only the occasional use of archival cable and broadcast news footage in addition to Lee's own film. And a grim tale it is, an "American tragedy" subtitled "a Requiem in Four Acts," each of them about an hour long ("Act V," appearing on the third of the set's three discs, is a lengthy epilogue with new material not included in the original HBO broadcast) and focusing almost exclusively on New Orleans, as opposed to the Gulf Coast region in general.      Act I sets the scene; as the hurricane nears the Crescent City, some residents leave town, while others stay behind, figuring they'll just ride the storm out (Mayor Ray Nagin's "mandatory evacuation" order rings fairly hollow, as there's no public transportation provided for the many who don't own vehicles and thus couldn't get out even if they wanted to). The real problems begin after Katrina makes landfall on August 29, 2005. Displaced New Orleaneans crowd into the Superdome, soon to become a living hell for those stuck there; the incredibly poorly engineered levees break, flooding some 80 percent of the city; and people start dying by the hundreds, victims of drowning, lack of food, water, and medicine, and other causes. And so it goes. Act II finds the survivors struggling to keep it together while the federal, state, and local assistance they've been promised fails to show up; Act III traces the dispersal of these so-called "refugees" (as one man puts it, "Refugees? You mean they took away our citizenship, too?") all over the country, not knowing where their families, friends, and neighbors are, or even if they're still alive; and Act IV deals with the slow rebuilding of the city while insurance companies refuse to pay claims and money keeps going toward the Iraq war effort instead.     Several themes predominate here. One, of course, is the appalling performance of authorities on nearly every level, who ignored specific warnings about the levees and then professed ignorance after the fact; Lee doesn't have to go out of his way to make George W. Bush, FEMA chief Michael Brown, and other members of the Bush administration (not to mention his own mother) look bad, as they do an excellent job of that themselves. Another is the shameful ineptitude of the response; it's hard not to be disgusted when it's pointed out more than once that while we were able to provide supplies and assistance to Indonesians within two days of the 2004 tsunami, American citizens were virtually ignored for five days or more. Most of all, When the Levees Broke (which includes optional commentary by Lee for all four acts) leaves us feeling the sheer rage of the poor and dispossessed of New Orleans, where the population is 70 percent African-American. Confronted with the ignorance, arrogance, and callousness of the people whose job it was to protect them, they can point to just one cause: racism. --Sam Graham

But this stayed with me for days! It makes you feel like you lived in NOLA at the time of Katrina, like you had friends or family there.I visited NOLA for the 1st time this year and it was amazing;  while watching this I had to remind myself that it was not recent because I wanted to fly down to help.I recommend this as a must watch. Ao many people donated money and most of it seems to have gone anywhere but nola. What they needed was actual help from people.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat documentaryByakton July 6, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThis is one of the best productions I believe Spike Lee may have ever produced, and I wish it was longer. You need to watch the whole series, not one part of five, and jump to a conclusion which is what the vast majority of the one and two star reviewers did. This is not all about race either, and that needs to be understood, albeit it certainly was clearly a partial motive. The gov't wanted to gentrify the area, and with homeowners abandoning property or being killed, it most certainly helped the gov't do so. Have an open-mind when watching this and come to your own conclusion, but the "pull yourself up by the boot straps" mentality will unlikely fair well watching this.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsUsed in my Meteorology class (High School)ByMitchellon February 25, 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI use this video in my Meteorology class. That being said, I have the students bring a waiver home that mentions what they are going to see in the video.First off, the video is amazing. To chronicle such a huge disaster as Hurricane Katrina was is a big task. Clearly, Spike Lee has a bit of an agenda to push (which isn't a huge deal since the Bush administration/FEMA couldn't have done a worse job in handling Katrina), but that doesn't take away from the video at all. The students complete an assignment after the video where they research criticisms about the response from other sources anyway.Second, the "characters" in the video are amazing. Students form bonds with each individual recollection of the events that took place and you just can't forget what these people went through.Third, the video doesn't take time away from showing you what actually happened. You will see the remnants of the event, dead people included, but the historical value far outweighs the gruesome nature of what you are seeing. Too often we live with blinders on and don't want to see the truth. This video doesn't allow that to happen. That being said, there is only about 5 minutes of that in the four part series.Lastly, I'd recommend this to anybody looking to gain some insight into Hurricane Katrina. The four part series is easily broken up into a week long activity in my class and the students don't get bored with what they see and this is consistently a high point of the class reviews I receive from my students.

As that man in the Ninth Ward said, they'll never let anything happen in the French Quarter or other touristy places.  They got taken care of pretty quickly  because tourism brings in a lot of $$$. But where the poor and non-white people live (and died because of the hurricane), it's low priority, he implied.  Money is so much more important than people on this planet.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsTHE TRUTHByWooley in PSLVINE VOICEon August 9, 2015Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseAt least Spike Lee gave us the truth.  After watching the TREME series, which is wonderful, by the way and free on PRIME, as is this series, I wanted to see, understand more of what happened with Katrina relief.  Spike Lee's series should be watched by everyone in the country, and maybe we could all feel the sadness and embarrassment we should feel for how this country treated New Orleans.  Watch and learn.  A great little series with serious truths and information.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDRead more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 stars... visiting the victims of Katrina and remarking on how good they have it was worth watching the seriesByBonnie Kon July 24, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThe video of Barbara Bush in Houston visiting the victims of Katrina and remarking on how good they have it was worth watching the series. Other than that it was a good refresher on a tragedy, but I wish more focus could have been placed on Mississippi. which took the brunt of the storm. I do wish that someone could also focus more on the putrid and corrupt history of building and maintaining the levee system around New Orleans.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsThank you Spike Lee.

The utter and absolute destruction of lives and property, of a whole way of life, is immeasurable.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsLearn from history or repeat itByali ton October 17, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseI've only gotten through the first episode, but so far, I'm impressed. The accounts/interviews are authentic, varied, and moving. There also is some "fresh" footage, not just iconic images we've seen over and over.Depending on your level of compassion and knowledge of Katrina, you'll be ashamed--maybe even shocked-- to see again how badly things were handled before, during, and after the storm. The film's agenda isn't surprising if you know Spike Lee's work: The gap between "haves" and "have-nots" in this country is both deep and wide. How you're treated--even on the most basic human level--is based on which of those two groups you fall in.Regardless of your political views, there are many lessons to be learned here. We'd better learn them because tomorrow the next "big one" could be where you live.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
