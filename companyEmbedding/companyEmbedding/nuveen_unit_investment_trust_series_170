Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

NUVEEN UNIT TRUSTS



SERIES 3




Nuveen Investment Grade Corporate Trust, Series 2 (Long-Term)      29,000  Units




FIXED INCOME PROSPECTUS - PART TWO

DATED FEBRUARY 28, 1999



NOTE: This Prospectus Part Two may not be distributed unless accompanied

by Part One.


Currently Offered at Public Offering Price plus interest accrued to the date of
settlement. Minimum purchase -- either $5,000 or 50 Units ($1,000 or 10 Units
for Traditional and Roth IRA purchases and $500 or nearest whole number of Units
whose value is less than $500 for Education IRA purchases), whichever is less.


THE UNITS of fractional undivided interest in the Nuveen Unit Trusts being
offered hereby are issued and outstanding Units that have been reacquired by
John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated either by purchase of Units tendered to the
Trustee for redemption or by purchase in the open market. The price paid in each
instance was not less than the Redemption Price determined as provided in Part
One under the caption "How Units May Be Redeemed Without Charge." The Units are
being offered at the Public Offering Price computed in the manner described in
Part One under the caption "Public Offering Price." Any profit or loss resulting
from the sale of Units will accrue to John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated and no
proceeds from the sale will be received by the Trusts.


The objective of the Investment Grade Corporate Trust is to provide a high level
of current income through investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of
investment grade corporate debt obligations issued after July 18, 1984. The
trust may also contain U.S. Treasury obligations (which as of the initial date
of deposit represented less than 20% of the principal amount of the Securities
deposited in the Trust).


The Trust is available to non-resident aliens, and the income from the Trust,
provided certain conditions are met, will be exempt from withholding for U.S.
federal income tax for such foreign investors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:


The Investment Grade Corporate Trust commenced operations on
November 5, 1997 with the initial deposit of 29,000 units having a value
of $2,799,551.


The Trustee is responsible for maintaining the books and records of the
Trust on a cash basis and for safekeeping securities owned by the Trust. The
Sponsor is responsible for preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles based upon the books and records
provided by the Trustee. The following is a summary of the significant
accounting policies followed by the Trust.


Security Valuation -- The Bonds are reflected at market value in the
accompanying statement of net assets. The Sponsor determines the market price of
the Bonds in the Trust (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers (including the Sponsor) who customarily deal in
bonds comparable to those held by the Trust, (2) if bid prices are not available
for any of the Bonds, on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds, (3) by
causing the value of the Bonds to be determined by others engaged in the
practice of evaluating, quoting or appraising comparable bonds, or (4) by any
combination of the above.


Unit Valuation -- On the Date of Deposit, the Public Offering Price of
Units was determined by adding a sales charge to the Trustee's determination of
the offering price of the Bonds. The value of Units offered in the secondary
market maintained by the Sponsor is based upon the pro rata share of the bid
price of the Bonds, plus a sales charge determined in accordance with the table
set forth in Part One under the caption "Public Offering Price" based on the
number of years remaining to the maturity of each Bond and adjusted for cash, if
any, held or owed by such Trust.


The initial underwriting commission and investors' original cost of
Units, as shown on the statement of net assets, are based upon the assumption
that the maximum sales commission was charged for each initial purchase of
Units.


Income and Expenses -- Income and expenses are recognized on the
accrual basis of accounting. Gains and losses from Bond transactions are
determined on a specific identification basis.


2.       INCOME TAX STATUS:


The trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for Federal
income tax purposes, and, therefore, has recorded no provision for Federal
income taxes. Each unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata
portion of the Trust under Subpart E, subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 and will have a taxable event each time the Trust disposes
of a bond.





3.       OPERATING EXPENSES:


See "Operating Expenses" in Part One of this Prospectus for information
with respect to trustee and evaluator fees and expenses.


4.       USE OF ESTIMATES:


The preparation of the Trust's financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires the Sponsor to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period.






NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS



1. The Bonds are first subject to optional redemption in the years,
and at the prices shown. Unless otherwise indicated, the Bonds, except for Bonds
issued at a substantial original issue discount, are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. Original issue discount
bonds are generally redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the
amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption plus, if applicable,
some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. The Bonds
may also be subject to sinking fund redemption without premium prior to the
dates shown.


Certain Bonds may be subject to redemption without premium prior to the
date shown pursuant to special or mandatory call provisions; for example, if
bond proceeds are not able to be used as contemplated, the project is condemned
or sold, or the project is destroyed and insurance proceeds are used to redeem
the bonds. (See Part One, "Composition of Trusts.")


The Trustee's determination of the offering price of Bonds in the Trust
may be greater or less than the amounts that may be received upon redemption or
maturity of such Bonds. Subject to rules concerning amortization of bond premium
and of original issue discount, gain or loss realized by the Trustee on
disposition of any Bonds will be recognized as taxable capital gain or loss by
Unitholders. (See Part One, "Tax Status of Unitholders.")


2. The ratings shown, which are not covered by the report of
independent public accountants, are those assigned as of the date of the
Schedule of Investments.


3. This Security has been purchased at a deep discount from the par
value because there is no stated interest income thereon. Securities which pay
no interest are normally described as "zero coupon" securities. Over the life of
Securities purchased at a deep discount, the value of such Securities will
increase such that, upon maturity, the holders of such Securities will receive
100% of the principal amount thereof.









REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors of John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated and
Unitholders of Nuveen Unit Trusts, Series 3:


We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets and schedule
of investments of Nuveen Unit Trusts, Series 3 (consisting of Nuveen Investment
Grade Corporate Trust, Series 2 (Long-Term)), as of October 31, 1998 and the
related statements of operations and changes in net assets for the period
indicated on the face of the financial statements. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Sponsor (See Note 1). Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the
Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. In
addition, securities owned as of October 31, 1998 were confirmed by direct
correspondence with the Trustee. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Nuveen Unit
Trusts, Series 3 (Nuveen Investment Grade Corporate Trust, Series 2
(Long-Term)), as of October 31, 1998, the results of its operations and changes
in its net assets for the period indicated on the face of the financial
statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

Incapital and Nuveen Investments Expand Unit Trust Partnership

		New Unit Trusts Leverage Expertise of Nuveen's Multi-Affiliate Model

		Enhanced by Incapital Additions to Unit Trust Business

		Nuveen Expands Specialist Sales Support Team for Unit Trusts

CHICAGO, June 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments, today announced the expansion of their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms to support the growth of the unit trust business and better serve the financial advisor community and their clients. Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management. In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.

	Commenting on the partnership, John DesPrez, Incapital's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Incapital's relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients."

INCAPITAL UNIT TRUSTS FEATURING NUVEEN'S INVESTMENT EXPERTISE

	Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments' affiliates:


		Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios

		Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios

		Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios

		Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios

		Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio


	To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes. Capitalizing on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year's series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86. This new unit trust's portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.

	Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments. Recognized for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes. 

	Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments' Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products added, "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors. We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialized investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives." 

JOINT-DISTRIBUTION EFFORT

	Incapital has recently appointed Hugh McHaffie as Managing Director who will soon oversee the origination and distribution of a range of wealth management solutions, including Unit Trust, Market Linked and Annuity offerings. McHaffie is supported by a veteran Unit Trust origination team in Chicago, headed by John Browning, Managing Director and Randy Watts, Executive Director. Pat Dwyer, National Sales Manager, will soon lead Incapital's nation-wide distribution network supporting financial advisors seeking wealth management investment solutions for their clients.

	Given the performance of the current unit trust offerings, strong interest from the market, and robust pipeline of new offerings currently under consideration, Nuveen Investments is also enhancing its unit trust distribution efforts with the appointment of Melissa Roe as Managing Director, National Head of Unit Trust Sales. Overseeing a team of external and internal unit trust specialists, Roe will act as a liaison between Nuveen Investments and Incapital to represent the capabilities of Nuveen Investments' affiliates and ensure that the needs of financial advisors and their investor clients are being served.

	Incapital was founded in 1999 and today is a leading underwriter and distributor of securities to more than 800 broker-dealers, institutions, asset managers, RIAs and banks.

Nuveen, Incapital team up to offer new equity unit trust
Strategist Bob Doll lends investment expertise to offering expected in early 2014






Nov 25, 2013 @ 1:53 pm
By 
	Trevor Hunnicutt























+ Zoom




      Two Chicago investment firms are linking together in a partnership aimed at helping both expand – starting with unit investment trusts.Fund manager Nuveen Asset Management and investment bank Incapital announced Monday a new stock-based unit investment trust developed with famous stock picker Robert C. Doll. The unit trust, which will debut in early 2014, is the first in a series of offerings to come from the partnership, Incapital's chief executive said on Monday.Unit investment trusts are a twist on the traditional mutual fund. Shareholders own a pool of investments that the portfolio manager buys and holds until a termination date, when the trust is dissolved and the proceeds are paid out. The underlying securities are not actively traded.
				



Unit trusts have been regaining popularity. There was nearly $72 billion in 5,787 unit trusts in 2012, up from about $60 billion in 2011, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is the highest asset level the product has seen, in absolute terms, since 2000. Stock-based trusts draw the lion's share, or 92%, of new deposits.In an interview, Incapital chief executive John Radtke said the unit trusts would be the first in a series of offerings by the partnership, which will take advantage of Nuveen's investment management expertise and Incapital's distribution network, as well as their trading and reporting website for issuers and broker-dealers.“There's more opportunities to grow this pie in the future,” Mr. Radtke said. “Our customer base was looking to move away from fixed income to alternative asset classes including equities.”Mr. Doll's career in the asset management industry has spanned more than three decades. The equity strategist retired from BlackRock Inc. last year after it was revealed that his proprietary quantitative methods actually were third-party models that he had tweaked and customized. Months later, he emerged in a new role at Nuveen. Nuveen, which historically has focused on local government debt, has been working to develop its offerings across asset classes since some of its bond offerings became unredeemable when credit markets seized up in 2008. The firm, which merged with U.S. Bancorp's long-term asset business after a 2010 acquisition, managed $118 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.Incapital is a boutique investment bank that specializes in bonds and complex debt products like structured notes — a hybrid derivative that might, for instance, combine the characteristics of a bond with those of an option to alter the risk-and-return profile of the investment.The chairman of Incapital is Thomas S. Ricketts, the son of TD Ameritrade Inc. founder J. Joseph Ricketts. The family purchased the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise in 2009.

Nuveen 2016 Equity Outlook Portfolio



Strategy


Overview


Historical Pricing


Performance


Portfolio Holdings


Distributions





Investment Objective

        The Nuveen 2016 Equity Outlook Portfolio is a unit trust that seeks to provide capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the objective will be met.

Investment Strategy
The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by
purchasing stocks that express the key
investment themes of Bob Doll’s 2016 Ten
Predictions, which anticipate potential
economic, political and financial developments
that may help shape investment opportunities
over the coming year.
Portfolio Security Selection:
Bob Doll, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, Nuveen Asset Management, uses a time-tested proprietary equity investment
process that combines quantitative techniques with fundamental research to recommend stocks for the Nuveen 2016 Equity Outlook Portfolio.
The portfolio is designed to capitalize on the economic and market environment described in Bob Doll’s 2016 Ten Predictions.
Universe – The Russell 1000® Index, composed of
approximately 1000 large-cap stocks.
Quantitative Analysis – A multi-factor quantitative model evaluates each
stock’s valuation, growth dynamics, profitability, and capital deployment to narrow the opportunity set.
Fundamental Ranking Process – Stocks are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5
(with 1 being most attractive and 5 being least attractive) using fundamental research and analysis. Stocks rated 5 are excluded from portfolio consideration.
Portfolio Construction – From the remaining pool, Bob Doll recommends,
based upon his judgment, a portfolio (1) most
likely to capitalize on the key investment themes of his 2016 Ten Predictions and (2) offering the highest potential for capital appreciation over the next
15 months. Risk/return frameworks are systematically utilized to limit perceived risk.
Portfolio – Portfolio of large cap stocks across diverse sectors.

                    0.500%
                



The table above shows the initial offering period sales charges. Percentages are based on a $10.00 per unit offering price. For unit prices other than $10.00, percentages of initial sales charge, creation and development fee, and deferred sales charge will vary. The maximum sales charge is comprised of the initial sales charge, creation and development fee and deferred sales charge. The Trust is also subject to annual operating expenses and organization costs, which are not included in the sales charges. The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay is less than $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%. Investors will not be assessed the initial and deferred sales charge for eligible fee-based accounts and must purchase units utilizing a Fee CUSIP. Please see the prospectus for sales charge details.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.
 
This trust is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector. The success of consumer discretionary companies, which manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer, is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success also depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer discretionary products in the marketplace.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.
 
This trust is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector. The success of consumer discretionary companies, which manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer, is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success also depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer discretionary products in the marketplace.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.
 
This trust is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector. The success of consumer discretionary companies, which manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer, is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success also depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer discretionary products in the marketplace.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.
 
This trust is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector. The success of consumer discretionary companies, which manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer, is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success also depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer discretionary products in the marketplace.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

U.S. real GDP remains below 3% and nominal GDP below 5% for an unprecedented tenth year in a row.
U.S. Treasury rates rise for a second year, but high yield spreads fall.
S&P 500 earnings make limited headway as consumer spending advances are partially offset by oil, the dollar and wage rates.
For the first time in almost 40 years, U.S. equities experience a single-digit percentage change for the second year in a row.
Stocks outperform bonds for the fifth consecutive year.
Non-U.S. equities outperform domestic equities, while non-U.S. fixed income outperforms domestic fixed income.
Information technology, financials and telecommunication services outperform energy, materials and utilities.
Geopolitics, terrorism and cyberattacks continue to haunt investors but have little market impact.
The federal budget deficit rises in dollars and as a percentage of GDP for the first time in seven years.
Republicans retain the House and the Senate and capture the White House.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Investment Objective

        The Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolio is a unit trust that seeks to provide current income and capital appreciation. There is no assurance that this objective will be met.

Investment Strategy
The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by purchasing a portfolio of real estate securities that has the potential for attractive total return, reduced volatility relative to its benchmark (the MSCI U.S. REIT Index or “Benchmark”), and consistent cash flow.
Security Selection from an Experienced Team
Nuveen Asset Management serves as the Trust’s portfolio consultant. The team
responsible for designing the portfolio has a proven track record managing real estate focused mutual funds, including
the Nuveen Real Estate Securities Fund, as well as closed-end funds and
separately managed accounts.
A Bottom-Up, Relative Value ApproachNuveen Asset Management conducts extensive research and analysis to design a largely sector-neutral portfolio diversified across multiple real estate sectors.
Broad Universe of 200+ Real Estate Securities - Investible universe of REITs, real estate operating companies, and development and service companies is broader than that of the Benchmark, enhancing the opportunity to identify securities with the potential to perform throughout the real estate cycle. 
Relative Value Analysis - Evaluation of the market's supply outlook, occupancy levels, capital availability, cash flow potential, geographical location and management experience narrows the opportunity set to companies the team believes offer the greatest potential for outperformance.
Additional Screening Metrics - Assessment of business fundamentals; valuation of property types relative to peers, the market and historical measures; and positive catalysts. Evaluation of risk/return potential of remaining securities to arrive at final portfolio recommendations.
Core Portfolio -  Real estate securities the team believes offer the best valuation opportunities across property types, with sector allocations that align closely with those of the Benchmark.

Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio.

Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.


Risk Considerations
				There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit.
				 
				Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time.
				 
				A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the materials sector. Some general risks of companies in the materials sector include the general state of the economy, consolidation, domestic and international politics and excess capacity. In addition, materials companies may also be significantly affected by volatility of commodity prices, import controls, worldwide competition, liability for environmental damage, depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control devices.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.
				 
				Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.
				 
				Companies with exposure to food security services or products could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technological developments and labor relations. These companies are also affected by changes in government regulation, world events and economic conditions, along with weather conditions and patterns.
				 
				Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
				 
				Investing in emerging markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments.
				 
				This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.
				 
				NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE
				 
				Incapital Unit Trust, Series 90, is a unit investment trust that consists of the BofA Merrill Lynch Food Security Portfolio, Series 1. Nuveen Securities, LLC serves as the Trust’s sponsor and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC serves as the Trust’s evaluator and supervisor.
				 
				The Trust is not sponsored or endorsed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (“Merrill Lynch”) and Merrill Lynch makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the unit holders of the Trust or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in units of the Trust. Merrill Lynch is not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC. The Trust is distributed by Nuveen Securities, LLC, a subsidiary of Nuveen, LLC.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
