Old Mutual Liquid Macro Goes Live






Old Mutual Global Investors has rapidly re-ignited the former Ignis Absolute Return Global Bond Fund strategy, raising over £500 million as of December 2015, just two months after launching two funds and 11 months after hiring most of the team from Standard Life. So far around 20% of the assets are in the Irish QAIF and 80% in the UCITS, which has a minimum investment of only £1,000, making it a ‘liquid alternatives’ product potentially for retail investors. The Ignis strategy had annualised at a return of 5% with volatility of 3.7% and won The Hedge Fund Journal’s 2013 UCITS Hedge award for ‘Best Performing Fund Over Two Years’. The Old Mutual Liquid Macro (OMLM) UCITS targets volatility of 4-6%, and returns of 5% over cash, which effectively means a 5% handle in early 2016. The QAIF structure, broadly speaking, multiplies the UCITS exposure by a factor of 1.6, so the QAIF targets cash plus 8% returns and 7-9% volatility. When interest rates rise – and lead manager Russ Oxley does expect UK, and even Eurozone, rates to follow the US higher – the return target will ratchet up, because most of the fund is sitting in cash collateral that earns interest.

Old Mutual Liquid Macro Goes Live
Distinctive process and return profile attracts assets

Old Mutual Global Investors has rapidly reignited the former Ignis Absolute Return Global Bond Fund strategy, raising over £500 million as of December 2015, just two months after launching two funds and 11 months after hiring most of the team from Standard Life. So far around 20% of the assets are in the Irish QAIF and 80% in the UCITS, which has a minimum investment of only £1,000, making it a ‘liquid alternatives’ product potentially for retail investors. The Ignis strategy had annualised at a return of 5% with volatility of 3.7% and won The Hedge Fund Journal’s 2013 UCITS Hedge award for ‘Best Performing Fund Over Two Years’. The Old Mutual Liquid Macro (OMLM) UCITS targets volatility of 4-6%, and returns of 5% over cash, which effectively means a 5% handle in early 2016. The QAIF structure, broadly speaking, multiplies the UCITS exposure by a factor of 1.6, so the QAIF targets cash plus 8% returns and 7-9% volatility. When interest rates rise – and lead manager Russ Oxley does expect UK, and even Eurozone, rates to follow the US higher – the return target will ratchet up, because most of the fund is sitting in cash collateral that earns interest.For some investors the pattern of returns matters as much as, or more than, the level. The asymmetry of the OMLM return profile, shown in Fig.1, is unusual because many investment strategies have a negatively skewed return profile, as do most longonly asset classes. As well as seeking a positive skew, over time Oxley expects OMLM returns should have no structural correlation to any traditional asset class, as there is no structural bias to being long or short of interest rates. Between 2011 and 2014, the strategy’s correlation with conventional asset classes was in fact slightly negative, because at that time the team was running a somewhat contrarian stance, profiting during the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’, for instance. They also did well out of themes around the European crisis and Draghi’s decisive ‘Whatever It Takes’ response in 2012.

Old Mutual Global Investors Aiming to Launch New Fixed Income Fund



Date: Wednesday, 07 May 2014



Old Mutual Global Investors Aiming to Launch New Fixed Income Fund. The Old Mutual Monthly Income High Yield Bond Fund
Old Mutual Global Investors today announces that it is aiming to launch The Old Mutual Monthly Income High Yield Bond Fund (‘The Fund’) during the course of the summer of 2014, subject to regulatory approval.  The Fund will aim to achieve a total return through a combination of income and capital growth from a well-diversified portfolio predominantly comprising of fixed and variable rate debt securities located worldwide.
The Fund will be managed by Christine Johnson and Bastian Wagner, who work as part of an integrated team, comprising specialists in high yield, financials and investment grade credit, as well as macro strategists and portfolio managers.   This team offers an excellent performance record.  As at the end of March 2014, the Old Mutual Corporate Bond Fund and the Old Mutual Monthly Income Bond Fund both had first quartile performance over one, three and five years.
The Fund is expected to focus on higher yielding corporate bonds as a means to deliver a strong, regular income stream.  The team will seek to deliver a competitive monthly distribution, with a 6—7% annual yield targeted at launch. Distributions will be smoothed to give the end-client as close as possible to a regular income. Capital enhancement – and a positive total return – will be achieved through active management of credit quality and interest rate risk. The Fund’s duration limits will be -3 to 9 years, enabling it to take advantage of both rising and falling yield environments.
Commenting on the rationale behind the planned launch of The Fund, Christine Johnson, Head of Fixed Income at Old Mutual Global Investors, said:
“We believe that there is a market opportunity to launch a product that will meet the continuing need of our clients to access income streams.
“As bank lending continues to contract, there is an increasing supply of good quality, higher yielding issues. The issuing companies are typically from continental – and particularly southern – Europe, long established, with good free cash flows, healthy balance sheets and credible growth prospects. This is a liquid, diversified market – for example, the BofA Merrill Lynch European Currency Fixed & Floating Rate Non-Financial High Yield Index has €242.4bn in issue, representing 541 separate issues.”
Bastian Wagner, Portfolio Manager – Fixed Income, added:
“Around a third of the market comprises of issues below €350m and we believe that this part of the market represents a particularly attractive opportunity. Companies issuing in this area are in many cases new to the bond market and issues under €350m are too small to be investible by the mega-funds. For these reasons, they will often offer somewhat better terms to those in the broader market.”
The team’s investment approach is big picture and thematic, emphasising analysis of real world trends in politics, economics, business and society.  The team monitors each of its themes through an external indicator and expresses its views through simple, liquid positions.   In reducing the investible market from ~3500 bonds to ~150, the team use a number of screens which reflect their thematic preferences.  The team tests the market factors (risk appetite, spreads and investment flows) and liquidity (volatility, valuation, age of bond, pricing frequency).  A further test for credit quality is undertaken through financial modelling and meetings with the management of the companies in which the team invests. The detailed modelling of each stock is debated at a weekly meeting of the full credit team.
The final selection depends on the level of conviction, sector overlap, portfolio diversification and position limits. Any stock bought should fit the themes, be of stable or improving credit quality, trade cheap or fair to its peers and have a catalyst for price appreciation.  The team sells a stock when any one of these factors no longer applies.

Old Mutual Global Investors launches two liquid alternatives funds

Launches & Fundraising











Old Mutual Global Investors is to launch the Old Mutual Absolute Return Government Bond Fund, which is a UCITs fund, and the Old Mutual Liquid Macro Fund, which is a Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund on 7 October 2015. 
The strategy will launch with USD150 million seed capital from Old Mutual plc.
 
The Funds will be managed by Russ Oxley and his team, who joined Old Mutual Global Investors from Ignis Asset Management earlier this year. Russ, the Lead Manager, and Co-Managers Adam Purzitsky and Paul Shanta, will be supported in their portfolio management and trading by Huw Davies and Jin Wong, and in systems development by Josh Heming. 
 
Warren Tonkinson, Managing Director of Old Mutual Global Investors, says: “This is a very exciting development for our company as a lot of work has been undertaken to prepare for the launch of this range.  We have had a lot of interest from investors as Russ and his team are highly respected, having one of the best track records of managing absolute return government bond funds in our industry.  We are therefore confident that demand will be strong from our global client base.”
 
The objective of the Funds is to seek to deliver positive total returns on a rolling 12-month basis with stable levels of volatility uncorrelated to bond and equity market conditions. The UCITS fund will be managed to a volatility target of 4 per cent-6 per cent, with expected annualised returns of cash plus 5 per cent. The QIAIF, which will also offer Investors Daily Liquidity, will be managed to a volatility target of 7 per cent-9 per cent, with expected annualised returns of Cash +8 per cent. The Funds aim to be diversified from global fixed income markets by employing a highly distinctive investment strategy focused on expressing views on macro themes through exposure to forward interest rates, inflation expectations and foreign exchange.
 
The low correlation with global bond markets is likely to be appealing at a time when the traditional safe-haven role of government bond markets is increasingly questionable. Due to the distinctive process and avoidance of credit and credit-like assets, and of emerging market debt the Fund is also  expected to exhibit low correlation with other absolute return investment strategies (including global macro hedge funds, fixed income, equity and multi-asset based strategies), making it a potentially attractive addition to a portfolio. The portfolio managers will place a strong emphasis on investing in highly liquid assets, in which the market has historically remained liquid, even in the most extreme periods, including for example the global financial crisis.
 
Donald Pepper, Managing Director of Alternatives, says: “We are delighted that Old Mutual will be supporting the strategy with USD150 million of seed capital at launch. This demonstrates the belief we have in the strategy and our commitment, to both these Funds, and to the development of the Alternatives business within Old Mutual Global Investors. We have successfully delivered uncorrelated returns in our highly liquid Global Equity Market Neutral strategy, which now has over USD4.5 billion¹ in client assets under management, and we hope for similar investor support for this highly liquid, uncorrelated, strategy.”
 
Adam Purzitsky, Co-Manager of the Fund, says: “Our investment philosophy hinges on the belief that, through a detailed understanding of forward interest rates, it is possible to express views on global macro trends in a very precise way.  Through our approach to investing, we are able to target specific risks and opportunities, without “inadvertently” taking economic exposures to those risks we would rather avoid.  At the core of our approach is the understanding that forward rates are influenced by very different factors depending on their location on the curve.   We believe we have the potential to deliver positive returns for investors within clearly defined volatility parameters irrespective of the direction of interest rates.  Our investment track record of successfully managing these strategies is clear evidence that our process if very effective.”
 
Paul Shanta, Co-Manager of the Fund, adds: “We have developed a unique investment strategy over a period of many years and a product that we think plays a valuable role in our clients’ wider portfolio. Joining Old Mutual Global Investors has given us the opportunity to further enhance our processes and technology and to prepare a bespoke platform for the launch of our new funds.  We are excited about being part of an organisation that shares our ambition and now look forward to working with investors.”
