 Educational Background



 


Miami University

                  Miami University is one of the oldest public universities in the country, made possible by an ordinance signed by President George Washington in 1795. Chartered in 1809, Miami welcomed its first students in 1824. Miami's reputation grew as quickly as its enrollment, and it became known as the "Yale of the West" for its ambitious liberal arts curriculum. Today, Miami consistently ranks among the nation's top public universities for the quality of teaching and overall student experience.

One of Miami University's most famous graduates was Benjamin Harrison, who later became a President of the United States. Professor William Holmes McGuffey revolutionized the education of generations of Americans when he conducted research for his Eclectic Readers series while teaching at Miami from 1826 to 1836. The "mother of fraternities," Miami was the founding site of four national fraternities: Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Tau; as well as Delta Zeta sorority.                




 


University of Rochester

                  The University of Rochester is a private, nonsectarian, research university in Rochester, New York, United States. The university grants undergraduate and graduate degrees, including doctoral and professional degrees. The university has six schools and various interdisciplinary programs. The University of Rochester is noted for its Eastman School of Music. The university is also home to the Institute of Optics, founded in 1929, the first educational program in the US devoted exclusively to optics. Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics is home to the second most energetic fusion laser in the world.

Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

Vintage & Used Table Lamps | Chairish

Table Lamps



      
      Table Lamps
    

Like a vase, a vintage table lamp often qualifies as a mini piece of art. Consider the colorful, textural lava-glaze lamps of the 1960s or the curvaceous brass spindle lamps created by lighting illuminist Stiffel. And that’s to say nothing of ultra-modern lamp designers like Stilnovo and George Kovacs. A pro tip: be sure to tot along your used lamp when it’s time to shade shop. Even for experts a try-on sesh is imperative to getting shape, size, and scale right.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT VINTAGE TABLE LAMPS
Whether you live in a space that’s been blessed with gracious overhead lighting or not, who can resist the romantic sway of mood lighting? Yes, flickering candles are the epitome of atmospheric light, but consider a vintage table lamp the lazy girl alternative. Add one to a side table or desk to cast an ambient glow without the stress that comes from babysitting an open flame, or use one as a jumping-off point for curating a lovely lifestyle vignette.
From bold, brass stallions to sculptural Mid-Century Modern spheres, used table lamps are more than just light sources, they’re decorative objects with majorly definitive points of view. For tips on how to choose the perfect vintage table lamp for you, read on below.
WHAT SPACE ARE YOU TRYING TO LIGHT?
First off, take a moment to size up your needs. Are you lighting an office? Bedroom? Or den? Some antique table lamps are quite necky (think swing-arm lamps and goosenecks), which makes them perfect for desks, while other lamps are grand, imposing pieces that will present nicely on large-scale furniture like credenzas.
If you’re decorating a credenza, you might also want to think about employing the power of pairs. Nothing adds drama quite like a duo (Just ask the Judds). The same goes for a bed flanked by nightstands. Why not add symmetry by adding a secondhand table lamp to each?
TYPES OF VINTAGE TABLE LAMPS
Jar Lamps
Curvaceous and stately, vintage jar lamps blow air kisses to tradition while pushing a bold, modern agenda. From the urn lamp to the gourd lamp, these vintage table lamps possess come-hither curves that are perfect for offsetting the 90-degree angles most case furniture offers up. Additionally, ample proportions make them game for accenting a large piece that might dwarf a smaller style like, say, a candlestick lamp.
Our Favorite: Ginger Jar Lamp. For those with an Eastern-trained eye, once cannot do better than a vintage ginger jar lamp. It reinterprets the original blue-and-white empress verbatim, minus the removable lid. Lack of storage aside, you get the same clean, fuss-less look of a ginger jar while receiving the added bonus of a chic, warming glow.

Neck Lamps
Sometimes you need a lamp that will put its neck on the line for you. Enter the most ably-named lamps we know: the gooseneck, the swing-arm, the banker’s and architect’s lamps. Packing compact profiles, these are task-oriented lamps that typically feature a sheltering shade attached to a long, thin neck and a heavy base. Imbued with undeniable 1920s allure, these antique lamps frequently meld modernist and industrialist principles, favoring brass, bronze, or stainless finishes. As their names suggest, they’re perfect for illuminating numbers, figures, or any other dexterous task you throw at them. Desk buddy? Absolutely.
Our Favorite: Gooseneck Lamp. While the name lacks a little elegance, we’ll admit, the gooseneck lamp is a timeless beauty nonetheless. Showcasing a dome shade that protects a lightbulb mother hen-style, the lamp dissolves into a flexible, ribbed neck which is supported by an oblong base typically etched with Nouveau-inspired scrollwork. For those who dare, try rotating a gooseneck 90-degrees—see how it takes on the undeniable shape of a sconce?
Candlestick Lamps
Candlestick lamps may have started out as a wired translation of the table candelabra, but they’ve since become definable as any lamp with a narrow-profile body supported by a larger, pedestal-style base. If you’re in the market for something traditional, this will likely be the style of lamp you end up with, as Neoclassical and Colonial-inspired lamps often follow the candlestick formula to a tee. Similarly, so do figural lamps, which often work in a cheeky, identifiable object at the base (like a pineapple), and then dissipates into a narrow neck.
Our Favorite: Spindle Lamp. Think about the architectural interest spindles lend to stairways, and you’ll understand why we can’t get enough of brass spindle lamps. While calling them curvy might be the understatement of the century, there’s no better word to convey their beguiling charm.
Globe Lamps
Essentially a shade-less lamp, the globe lamp encompasses any lamp that features a body that also doubles as the light diffuser. Modern lamps tend to take on simplistic shapes like spheres which rest on virtually invisible bases, but in the early 20th-Century, Victorians created bronze sculptures on which a glowing sphere rested. While most of these lamps are strictly mood enhancers, there’s no denying their theatrical presence.
Our Favorite: TV Lamp. For anybody who has ever fancied a vintage table lamp shaped like a panther or a pair of Siamese cats—meet the TV lamp. These fiberglass or plaster lamps were originally designed to illuminate a TV during the era when it was believed watching TV in the dark would ruin your eyesight. Yes, we know better now, but wouldn’t these kitschy relics make adorable companions to a quirky office or bar?

      Lighting
    

A vintage lamp or fixture makes your room more beautiful, and its light makes YOU more beautiful. Layer your lighting. Make a used table lamp part of a clever vignette (add a sculpture, a stack of books and a single blossom in a vase). A floor lamp turns a chair into a reading nook. A chandelier (be it atomic-era or Venetian) adds personality plus. Go ahead, shed some light on the subject.
