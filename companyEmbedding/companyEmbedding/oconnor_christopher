Today, the firm’s services have grown to include financial improvement, performance improvement, technology optimization, management & workforce solutions, sterile processing, value analysis, and through the supply chain, leading providers to the intersection of cost, quality, and outcomes.
Prior to his tenure at GNYHA Ventures, Mr. O’Connor worked at KPMG and Deloitte, where he spent several years working internationally (in Brazil, Holland, and South Africa) on supply chain projects in financial services, manufacturing, and transportation. Back in the U.S., Mr. O’Connor spent a year working with the United Nations and the then-budding Department of Homeland Security.

    Current Research  
Kit O’Connor is an Ecologist with the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station working on the human dimensions of managing the risks and benefits of wildland fire. His current projects involve support for the National Forest Planning process and critical examination of the incident command structure to assist in development of scalable, long-term forest and fire planning decision systems.



    Research Interests  
Fire Ecology, Fire Management, Forest Disturbance Ecology, Entomology



    Past Research  
Kit’s previous work was centered on ecological reconstruction of landscape changes, response to climate and human impacts, and projected changes to forest and disturbance dynamics in response to projected future climate conditions.

 Linking spatial fire planning to management of large fires 
Post date: June 02, 2016  Effective and efficient risk based management requires integrated knowledge, systems and planning tools that explore the interaction of the full range of land and fire management activities.
 











   



 Risk and resiliency 
Post date: June 02, 2016  The principles of decision science and risk management are essential to reduce the potential for loss from wildfires.
 











   



 Organizational structure and managerial incentive systems for wildland fire 
Post date: June 02, 2016  The Wildfire Risk Management Team is examining the biases in perceiving and managing risk, and in particular how fire managers jointly consider wildfire probability contours, suppression strategy likelihood of success, and values at risk.
 











   



 Econometric modeling of fire management expenditures 
Post date: June 02, 2016  The Wildfire Risk Management Team employs econometric modeling to empirically examine various aspects of wildland fire management expenditures
 











   



 Integrated spatial risk assessment modeling and planning 
Post date: May 02, 2016  This is the summary text for the project
 











   



 Wildfire risk management 
Post date: March 15, 2016  The Wildfire Risk Management Team is an interdisciplinary team that explores wildfire management through the lenses of risk analysis, economics, decision science, and landscape ecology to improve the scientific basis for the full range of wildfire management decisions. Primary research topics include integrated spatial risk assessment modeling and planning, econometric modeling of fire management expenditures, effectiveness of suppression resource utilization, organizational structure and managerial incentive systems, and performance measurement.
