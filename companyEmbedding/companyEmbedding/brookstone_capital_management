Strategies




Our risk-management investment approach seeks to protect and grow wealth in any market.



Methodology
Strategies














Overview




Our wide spectrum of investment options gives us the ability to offer an array of customized solutions to suit investor risk tolerance, investment objectives and timeline horizons.









Brookstone Capital Management Strategies
We provide a wide spectrum of investment options to help advisors develop and implement actively managed long-term investment strategies for individual investors. We seek to maintain a risk-managed approach toward investing, and our portfolios range from conservative to moderate to growth to allow for investor risk tolerance preferences.
See glossary of terms below
Please see disclosure below





Brookstone Capital Management Strategies







Brookstone RAISE 360° Select Models






Brookstone Municipal Bond






Brookstone Bond Portfolio






Brookstone Structured Notes






BROOKSTONE MARKET-LINKED CDs







Our RAISE 360° Select Models are designed to adhere to proper diversification and risk appropriate portfolio selection across market cycles.
Built utilizing the entire Strategic + Tactical investment universe and financial intelligence available on BCM's expansive platform.
Designed to help investors consistently exercise patience and discipline throughout changing investment markets.









The investment objective of the Municipal Bond Portfolio strategy is to provide current income that is exempt from federal personal income taxes and to preserve investors’ principal. This strategy uses open-ended mutual funds to gain exposure to multiple managers with different fund objectives. 








The Bond Portfolio strategy holds only individual investment grade corporate bonds or municipal bonds, and is a laddered fixed income strategy whereby multiple bonds are purchased, each with different maturity dates.








Structured Notes consists of a debt security linked to the performance of a reference asset (equity, basket of equities, equity index, commodity, commodity index, or foreign currency). Among the variety of structures available, most aim to help investors achieve the following primary objectives: minimize the loss of principal, generate higher yields, or participate in enhanced returns. 








The Market-Linked CD strategy (MLCDs) provides investors with exposure to market-based returns linked to any one or more asset classes using FDIC-Insured, principal-protected MLCDs.



















Brookstone Sub-Advisors
BCM partners with innovative, independent investment firms to offer access to a select yet diverse range of investment strategies. These sub-advisors, which share our same approach toward risk management, are able to offer investment options that are tailored to investors’ financial goals and objectives.

Glossary
 
Bear Market: A market in which prices are declining. A "bear" is a person who expects that the market or the price of a particular security will decline.
Call Options: An option which gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a fixed amount of a certain stock at a specified price within a specified time. Calls are purchased by investors who expect a price increase.
Canterbury Volatility Index (CVI): Measures the market’s volatility or emotional state. A CVI reading below 90 reflects a stable or rational market. A CVI above 90 reflects an emotional market.  Investors may not make direct investments into an index.
Drawdown:  The peak-to-trough decline during a specific record period of an investment, fund or commodity. A drawdown is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the trough.
ETF: An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold. Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated once at the end of every day like a mutual fund does.
Index-Linked Certificate Of Deposit:  A certificate of deposit (CD) with a return based on a specific index. These CDs are purchased for a fixed price and are FDIC insured.  Reference to an index does not imply that the strategy will achieve returns, volatility or other results similar to that index. The composition of the index may not reflect the manner in which a strategy is constructed in relation to expected or achieved returns, portfolio guidelines, restrictions, sectors, correlations, concentrations, volatility or tracking error targets, all of which are subject to change.  Investors may not make direct investments into an index.
MSCI KLD 400 Social Index: Comprises securities of large, mid and small cap U.S. companies with high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings and excludes companies involved in Alcohol, Gambling, Tobacco, Military Weapons, Civilian Firearms, Nuclear Power, Adult Entertainment, and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). The Index aims to serve as a benchmark for investors whose objectives include owning companies with very high ESG ratings and avoiding companies that are incompatible with specific values-based criteria.  Reference to an index does not imply that the strategy will achieve returns, volatility or other results similar to that index. The composition of the index may not reflect the manner in which a strategy is constructed in relation to expected or achieved returns, portfolio guidelines, restrictions, sectors, correlations, concentrations, volatility or tracking error targets, all of which are subject to change.  Investors may not make direct investments into an index.
MSCI USA Catholic Values Index: A free float-adjusted market capitalization index consisting of 400 companies designed to be used as a U.S. equity benchmark for Catholic investors who seek equity ownership in alignment with the moral and social teachings of the Catholic Church. The composition of the index may not reflect the manner in which a strategy is constructed in relation to expected or achieved returns, portfolio guidelines, restrictions, sectors, correlations, concentrations, volatility or tracking error targets, all of which are subject to change.  Investors may not make direct investments into an index.
Open-End or Mutual Fund Investment Company:  This is a company which uses its capital to invest in other companies. Open-end, or mutual funds, sell their own new shares to investors, buy back their old shares, and are not listed for trading on a stock exchange. Open-end funds get their name because their capitalization is not fixed and they normally issue more shares as people want them.
Options: A purchaser of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell certain securities at a specified price within a specified time.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT):  An investment vehicle that invests funds on behalf of its investors in real estate-related investments such as construction loans, mortgages, land and real estate company securities.
S&P 500 Index: An index of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity and industry grouping, among other factors. Companies included in the index are selected by the S&P Index Committee, a team of analysts and economists at Standard & Poor's.  Reference to an index does not imply that the strategy will achieve returns, volatility or other results similar to that index. The composition of the index may not reflect the manner in which a strategy is constructed in relation to expected or achieved returns, portfolio guidelines, restrictions, sectors, correlations, concentrations, volatility or tracking error targets, all of which are subject to change.  Investors may not make direct investments into an index.
Time Decay: The ratio of change in an option's price to the decrease in time to expiration of the option which occurs because the probability of that option being profitable is reduced.

Individual Investors-Main Content









Personalized Planning
The first step a BCM Independent Advisor Representative takes is to meet with you in person to better understand your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This is how we develop a long-term financial plan tailored to your specific needs. This individualized plan serves as a roadmap to develop a customized investment strategy designed to grow and monitor your wealth.
Risk-Managed Strategy
Once you’ve worked together to establish your investment goals, your BCM advisor will develop and implement a formal investment strategy. While each investment will have its own methodology, we make sure each follows BCM’s risk-managed approach. We believe that a strategy that seeks to avoid significant drawdowns allows more potential for compounding returns.









Our Independent Advisor Representatives actively manage your portfolio to make sure it supports your objectives in an ever-evolving marketplace.

“We take a multi-layered, tactical approach to investing designed to adapt quickly to constantly changing market moods. This strategy allows investors the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while still maintaining a definitive, imbedded layer of risk management.”

– DEAN ZAYED, CEO

A Brookstone store in Kittery, Maine


Brookstone is a chain of retail stores in the United States and China. Its first location opened in 1973 in Peterborough, New Hampshire.[3] The company's headquarters are currently located in Merrimack, New Hampshire.[3][4]
Brookstone sells a wide assortment of products including remote control helicopters and drones, alarm clocks and smartwatches, massage chairs, speakers, iPads and tablet accessories, blankets, pillows, and many other lifestyle items. Most of the products sold at Brookstone stores are designed by the company and sold under its own brand (white brand).[3][5] Brookstone stores are generally found in shopping malls and high-traffic city areas, such as Midtown Manhattan.
The company is also distinctive in that it allows customers to play with any product in the store before making a purchase.[3]
On April 3, 2014, the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware; in its first-day motions on April 4, the company sought permission to be acquired by the parent of Spencer Gifts.[6][7] The company's stores are to remain open and running as usual during the bankruptcy process.
In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The company emerged from bankruptcy in July 2014.

History[edit]
Pierre de Beaumont and his wife Mary began Brookstone in 1965, for $500.[8] After learning accounting by correspondence, they began mailing catalogs to thousands of hobbyists.[8] It was based in their Berkshires farmhouse, and they named the company after their farm.
Pierre de Beaumont was known as a tinkerer,[8] and Brookstone's start and initial product base was driven around the purpose of making hard-to-find and useful items/tools.[4][8][9] Brookstone started out as a catalog company,[3] with local and long-distance catalog circulations that initially were introduced from a classified ad in a Popular Mechanics magazine in 1965.[3][9] The demand for the unique products that Brookstone offered developed into a strong consumer, demand-based system that led to a need for specific Brookstone retail stores.[4]
Brookstone opened its first store in 1972 in New Hampshire. Due to the growing success of this store, many more followed during the next decade. One small issue developed from their store outlets – this issue was that the customer-base for Brookstone stores were almost exclusively limited to those who receive their distributed catalogs. Brookstone fixed this issue in the 1980s by introducing products in their store not available in their catalogs that still had a focus on their original idea of offering unique tools and household goods. The new items introduced in their retail stores brought in items geared towards travel, leisure, technology, audio, and games, and even developed a hands-on experience for almost all of their products.[3][4][9] Due to the introduction of these new products, more customers developed an interest and sales gradually increased through the 1980s.[4]
In 1987, sales were posted at $93 million, which Brookstone considered a record.[4] Their income, though, was at a loss of $9.7 million,[4] and this situation continued through the late 1980s. Even though sales were increasing, Brookstone decided to focus on ideas of creating products towards women, and converting their stores' overall look driven towards a "men's clubhouse" feeling. Store arrangements were also changed to provide a less crowded, and more comfortable atmosphere. These efforts proved to be successful as an annual positive income was made at $4.9 million, with sales at $104.6 million in the early '90s.[4]
Even with this success, Brookstone wanted more improvements, and decided to sack its computer programming staff that worked on their retail computer system. With needs in the retail scene changing, their initial, already developed retail software systems became useful, which ended up making Brookstone's remaining staffed programmers unnecessary, which developed into strong annual savings for Brookstone.[4]
In 1992, Brookstone ventured upon new types of sales avenues with the use of kiosks that featured the ability to purchase Brookstone items right at the kiosk, but contained a limited selection of items.[4] The kiosks were separated from the Brookstone stores, but were contained in the same mall. These kiosks also proved to be a successful business venture with an overall sales jump to $143.7 million.[4]
By 1993, Brookstone operated around 100 stores in the US. Sales in these stores accounted for 85 percent of their annual revenue, with their still existing magazine, and kiosk sales contributing to the remaining 15 percent.[4]
At this time, Brookstone only had two distribution centers, and decided to add a brand-new one in 1994 in Missouri, which resulted in faster shipments of their products to customers at no cost – as they ventured into the late 1990s with a count of around 150 stores in 32 states, more than 100 kiosks, and with the introduction of their online retail store.[4][9] Brookstone evolved into a multimillion-dollar company while retaining a strong grip on their original theme of offering unique and interesting products. Over the course of the 1990s, Brookstone moved away from selling tools and similar items, and began to focus more on electronics. In the mid-2000s, Brookstone stores were redesigned with tile floors and track lighting.[10][3][4][9]
In January 2014, Brookstone missed an interest payment to bondholders on their debt of $125 million from the original Osim/Childs/Temasek buyout.[11] As a result, Brookstone began to consult with firms including Hilco Global and Tiger Capital Group LLC on buying or investing in the company. On March 26, 2014, it was reported that the mall retailer Spencer Spirit Holdings, the parent of Spencer Gifts, would look to acquire Brookstone out of Bankruptcy for $120 million.[12] On April 3, 2014, Brookstone filed for bankruptcy as expected.[7]
In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The Company emerged from Bankruptcy in July 2014.[citation needed]
Competition[edit]
Brookstone was in competition with The Sharper Image, which has since declared bankruptcy. Brookstone's major competitor, Hammacher Schlemmer, retails mostly online and through catalogs. It has one retail store in New York City.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Employment[edit]
In November 2009, Brookstone received media coverage over the firing of Massachusetts man Peter Vadala, who allegedly disagreed with a co-worker's homosexuality in a Boston store, after she made references to her same-sex fiancee seeking Vadala's congratulations. Brookstone asserts it has a zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory harassment.[13] Vadala asserted that Christians are "obviously" excluded from that discriminatory harassment policy in a Fox & Friends interview.
Frog-O-Sphere[edit]
The treatment of animals in Brookstone's Frog-O-Sphere, an aquarium-like self-cleaning tank which contains two African dwarf frogs,[14] has caused an animal rights controversy. In November 2009, PETA released an undercover video investigation allegedly depicting inhumane treatment of frogs prior to their use in Frog-O-Spheres at their supplier, Wild Creations. PETA alleges that frogs are raised in unfiltered water, infrequently fed,[14] and suffering from fungal infections.[15] Brookstone has denied these charges.[15]

A Brookstone store in Kittery, Maine


Brookstone is a chain of retail stores in the United States and China. Its first location opened in 1973 in Peterborough, New Hampshire.[3] The company's headquarters are currently located in Merrimack, New Hampshire.[3][4]
Brookstone sells a wide assortment of products including remote control helicopters and drones, alarm clocks and smartwatches, massage chairs, speakers, iPads and tablet accessories, blankets, pillows, and many other lifestyle items. Most of the products sold at Brookstone stores are designed by the company and sold under its own brand (white brand).[3][5] Brookstone stores are generally found in shopping malls and high-traffic city areas, such as Midtown Manhattan.
The company is also distinctive in that it allows customers to play with any product in the store before making a purchase.[3]
On April 3, 2014, the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware; in its first-day motions on April 4, the company sought permission to be acquired by the parent of Spencer Gifts.[6][7] The company's stores are to remain open and running as usual during the bankruptcy process.
In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The company emerged from bankruptcy in July 2014.

History[edit]
Pierre de Beaumont and his wife Mary began Brookstone in 1965, for $500.[8] After learning accounting by correspondence, they began mailing catalogs to thousands of hobbyists.[8] It was based in their Berkshires farmhouse, and they named the company after their farm.
Pierre de Beaumont was known as a tinkerer,[8] and Brookstone's start and initial product base was driven around the purpose of making hard-to-find and useful items/tools.[4][8][9] Brookstone started out as a catalog company,[3] with local and long-distance catalog circulations that initially were introduced from a classified ad in a Popular Mechanics magazine in 1965.[3][9] The demand for the unique products that Brookstone offered developed into a strong consumer, demand-based system that led to a need for specific Brookstone retail stores.[4]
Brookstone opened its first store in 1972 in New Hampshire. Due to the growing success of this store, many more followed during the next decade. One small issue developed from their store outlets – this issue was that the customer-base for Brookstone stores were almost exclusively limited to those who receive their distributed catalogs. Brookstone fixed this issue in the 1980s by introducing products in their store not available in their catalogs that still had a focus on their original idea of offering unique tools and household goods. The new items introduced in their retail stores brought in items geared towards travel, leisure, technology, audio, and games, and even developed a hands-on experience for almost all of their products.[3][4][9] Due to the introduction of these new products, more customers developed an interest and sales gradually increased through the 1980s.[4]
In 1987, sales were posted at $93 million, which Brookstone considered a record.[4] Their income, though, was at a loss of $9.7 million,[4] and this situation continued through the late 1980s. Even though sales were increasing, Brookstone decided to focus on ideas of creating products towards women, and converting their stores' overall look driven towards a "men's clubhouse" feeling. Store arrangements were also changed to provide a less crowded, and more comfortable atmosphere. These efforts proved to be successful as an annual positive income was made at $4.9 million, with sales at $104.6 million in the early '90s.[4]
Even with this success, Brookstone wanted more improvements, and decided to sack its computer programming staff that worked on their retail computer system. With needs in the retail scene changing, their initial, already developed retail software systems became useful, which ended up making Brookstone's remaining staffed programmers unnecessary, which developed into strong annual savings for Brookstone.[4]

In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The company emerged from bankruptcy in July 2014.

History[edit]
Pierre de Beaumont and his wife Mary began Brookstone in 1965, for $500.[8] After learning accounting by correspondence, they began mailing catalogs to thousands of hobbyists.[8] It was based in their Berkshires farmhouse, and they named the company after their farm.
Pierre de Beaumont was known as a tinkerer,[8] and Brookstone's start and initial product base was driven around the purpose of making hard-to-find and useful items/tools.[4][8][9] Brookstone started out as a catalog company,[3] with local and long-distance catalog circulations that initially were introduced from a classified ad in a Popular Mechanics magazine in 1965.[3][9] The demand for the unique products that Brookstone offered developed into a strong consumer, demand-based system that led to a need for specific Brookstone retail stores.[4]
Brookstone opened its first store in 1972 in New Hampshire. Due to the growing success of this store, many more followed during the next decade. One small issue developed from their store outlets – this issue was that the customer-base for Brookstone stores were almost exclusively limited to those who receive their distributed catalogs. Brookstone fixed this issue in the 1980s by introducing products in their store not available in their catalogs that still had a focus on their original idea of offering unique tools and household goods. The new items introduced in their retail stores brought in items geared towards travel, leisure, technology, audio, and games, and even developed a hands-on experience for almost all of their products.[3][4][9] Due to the introduction of these new products, more customers developed an interest and sales gradually increased through the 1980s.[4]
In 1987, sales were posted at $93 million, which Brookstone considered a record.[4] Their income, though, was at a loss of $9.7 million,[4] and this situation continued through the late 1980s. Even though sales were increasing, Brookstone decided to focus on ideas of creating products towards women, and converting their stores' overall look driven towards a "men's clubhouse" feeling. Store arrangements were also changed to provide a less crowded, and more comfortable atmosphere. These efforts proved to be successful as an annual positive income was made at $4.9 million, with sales at $104.6 million in the early '90s.[4]
Even with this success, Brookstone wanted more improvements, and decided to sack its computer programming staff that worked on their retail computer system. With needs in the retail scene changing, their initial, already developed retail software systems became useful, which ended up making Brookstone's remaining staffed programmers unnecessary, which developed into strong annual savings for Brookstone.[4]
In 1992, Brookstone ventured upon new types of sales avenues with the use of kiosks that featured the ability to purchase Brookstone items right at the kiosk, but contained a limited selection of items.[4] The kiosks were separated from the Brookstone stores, but were contained in the same mall. These kiosks also proved to be a successful business venture with an overall sales jump to $143.7 million.[4]
By 1993, Brookstone operated around 100 stores in the US. Sales in these stores accounted for 85 percent of their annual revenue, with their still existing magazine, and kiosk sales contributing to the remaining 15 percent.[4]
At this time, Brookstone only had two distribution centers, and decided to add a brand-new one in 1994 in Missouri, which resulted in faster shipments of their products to customers at no cost – as they ventured into the late 1990s with a count of around 150 stores in 32 states, more than 100 kiosks, and with the introduction of their online retail store.[4][9] Brookstone evolved into a multimillion-dollar company while retaining a strong grip on their original theme of offering unique and interesting products. Over the course of the 1990s, Brookstone moved away from selling tools and similar items, and began to focus more on electronics. In the mid-2000s, Brookstone stores were redesigned with tile floors and track lighting.[10][3][4][9]
In January 2014, Brookstone missed an interest payment to bondholders on their debt of $125 million from the original Osim/Childs/Temasek buyout.[11] As a result, Brookstone began to consult with firms including Hilco Global and Tiger Capital Group LLC on buying or investing in the company. On March 26, 2014, it was reported that the mall retailer Spencer Spirit Holdings, the parent of Spencer Gifts, would look to acquire Brookstone out of Bankruptcy for $120 million.[12] On April 3, 2014, Brookstone filed for bankruptcy as expected.[7]
In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The Company emerged from Bankruptcy in July 2014.[citation needed]
Competition[edit]
Brookstone was in competition with The Sharper Image, which has since declared bankruptcy. Brookstone's major competitor, Hammacher Schlemmer, retails mostly online and through catalogs. It has one retail store in New York City.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Employment[edit]
In November 2009, Brookstone received media coverage over the firing of Massachusetts man Peter Vadala, who allegedly disagreed with a co-worker's homosexuality in a Boston store, after she made references to her same-sex fiancee seeking Vadala's congratulations. Brookstone asserts it has a zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory harassment.[13] Vadala asserted that Christians are "obviously" excluded from that discriminatory harassment policy in a Fox & Friends interview.
Frog-O-Sphere[edit]
The treatment of animals in Brookstone's Frog-O-Sphere, an aquarium-like self-cleaning tank which contains two African dwarf frogs,[14] has caused an animal rights controversy. In November 2009, PETA released an undercover video investigation allegedly depicting inhumane treatment of frogs prior to their use in Frog-O-Spheres at their supplier, Wild Creations. PETA alleges that frogs are raised in unfiltered water, infrequently fed,[14] and suffering from fungal infections.[15] Brookstone has denied these charges.[15]

And if you’re looking to get the party started or keep kids entertained, our outdoor activities and games are the perfect way to have a good time outside.
