Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

LLC FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Limited Liability Companies | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

ASV Skid Steer Loaders  
ASV now offers a line of high-performance skid steer loaders. These are ideal for working on a wide range of jobs when ground conditions permit the use of a compact wheeled machine.
 
ASV's Skid Steer Loaders come in two sizes, each available with radial lift loader linkage (RS) or as a vertical lift loader (VS). Radial lift machines offer the most aggressive excavation capabilities and vertical lift machines have more reach and lift for use in pallet or material placing operations.
 
ASV Skid Steer Loaders offer state-of-the-art technology for exceptional performance, durability and operator comfort. Unlike most other skid steer brands, the ASV models give you exceptional ground clearance and a larger departure angle at the rear bumper so you can climb easier and work more productively in a wider range of ground conditions - which is the hallmark of the ASV brand.
 
Like ASV Track Loaders, ASV Skid Steers offer world-class operator stations that offer a wide range of options for doors, windows, complete cab enclosures and climate controls. Simple, easy-to-use joystick controls and exceptional visibility make operating ASV Skid Steers a breeze, even in confined or enclosed areas.
 
Although these skid steer loaders are new to the ASV brand, they have been in operation for several years and have been thoroughly field-proven. Their reliability is exceptional.

About Us  
ASV Holdings, Inc. is a designer and manufacturer of compact construction equipment with emphasis on compact track loaders.  Equipment designed and built by ASV uses unique and patented rubber track undercarriage technology that provides exceptional traction on soft, wet, slippery, rough or hilly terrain.

ASV's history dates back to 1983 when it began development of its first product: the Track Truck. Its founders included Edgar Hetteen and Gary Lemke, both forerunners of the early snowmobile industry. Hetteen founded both Polaris Industries and then Arctic Cat, whereas Lemke was owner of the largest Arctic Cat dealerships in North America.  Lemke and Hetteen developed the Track Truck - a rubber-tracked vehicle the size of a pick-up truck yet with ground pressure less than a human on foot. It was an ideal utility machine for use in adverse ground conditions, such as in northern Minnesota where they lived. Thus, ASV was formed. 
 
In 1990 ASV introduced the first Posi-Track rubber track loader to meet the needs of construction, agricultural and landscaping industries. The MD-70 blended the power of a steel track dozer with the versatility of a loader-mounted quick-coupler and put it all on a rugged rubber track undercarriage. Many of the MD-70s were built, including specialized versions for California vineyards and mine-removal units serving the military in the Middle East.

In 1995 ASV moved from its original facility in Marcell, MN to its current location in Grand Rapids, MN. The facilities there grew as did ASV's reputation for its unique machines and track-driven undercarriage technology. In 1998 ASV entered into an alliance with Caterpillar Inc. and continues to produce rubber track undercarriages for some of the Cat compact equipment product line.

In 2007 Terex, Inc. purchased ASV Inc. from its original shareholders and later began to offer ASV-designed compact track loaders under the Terex brand. They added a line of ASV-built skid steer loaders to the Terex product line in 2011.

In 2014 ASV LLC was formed through a joint venture by Manitex International, Inc. and Terex, whereas Manitex owned 51 percent of ASV. In April 2015, ASV LLC began marketing its own line of compact track loaders, once again under the ASV brand.
 
In 2017, the public company ASV Holdings, Inc. was created when the company completed its I.P.O and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol 'ASV'.  The tradition of innovation and expertise in rubber track undercarriage design that started in the early 1980's continues today as the company manufactures a full range of ASV branded compact track and skidsteer loaders.

About Us  
ASV Holdings, Inc. is a designer and manufacturer of compact construction equipment with emphasis on compact track loaders.  Equipment designed and built by ASV uses unique and patented rubber track undercarriage technology that provides exceptional traction on soft, wet, slippery, rough or hilly terrain.

ASV's history dates back to 1983 when it began development of its first product: the Track Truck. Its founders included Edgar Hetteen and Gary Lemke, both forerunners of the early snowmobile industry. Hetteen founded both Polaris Industries and then Arctic Cat, whereas Lemke was owner of the largest Arctic Cat dealerships in North America.  Lemke and Hetteen developed the Track Truck - a rubber-tracked vehicle the size of a pick-up truck yet with ground pressure less than a human on foot. It was an ideal utility machine for use in adverse ground conditions, such as in northern Minnesota where they lived. Thus, ASV was formed. 
 
In 1990 ASV introduced the first Posi-Track rubber track loader to meet the needs of construction, agricultural and landscaping industries. The MD-70 blended the power of a steel track dozer with the versatility of a loader-mounted quick-coupler and put it all on a rugged rubber track undercarriage. Many of the MD-70s were built, including specialized versions for California vineyards and mine-removal units serving the military in the Middle East.

In 1995 ASV moved from its original facility in Marcell, MN to its current location in Grand Rapids, MN. The facilities there grew as did ASV's reputation for its unique machines and track-driven undercarriage technology. In 1998 ASV entered into an alliance with Caterpillar Inc. and continues to produce rubber track undercarriages for some of the Cat compact equipment product line.

In 2007 Terex, Inc. purchased ASV Inc. from its original shareholders and later began to offer ASV-designed compact track loaders under the Terex brand. They added a line of ASV-built skid steer loaders to the Terex product line in 2011.

In 2014 ASV LLC was formed through a joint venture by Manitex International, Inc. and Terex, whereas Manitex owned 51 percent of ASV. In April 2015, ASV LLC began marketing its own line of compact track loaders, once again under the ASV brand.
 
In 2017, the public company ASV Holdings, Inc. was created when the company completed its I.P.O and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol 'ASV'.  The tradition of innovation and expertise in rubber track undercarriage design that started in the early 1980's continues today as the company manufactures a full range of ASV branded compact track and skidsteer loaders.

Our wheeled SSL models also share these common brand attributes.  Our equipment is sold through an independent dealer network throughout North America (consisting of 133 locations in 41 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces as of December 2016), Australia and New Zealand. We own and operate from a 238,000 square-foot production facility located in Grand Rapids, MN.
BRIEF HISTORY
A.S.V. was founded in 1983 by forerunners of the early snowmobile industry, Polaris Industries and Arctic Cat, and in 1991 introduced the first Posi-Track rubber-track loader serving construction, agricultural and landscaping industries. A.S.V., Inc. first launched as a publicly-traded (Nasdaq-listed) company in 1994, was acquired by Terex Corp. (NYSE:TEX) on March 3, 2008, and in December 2014, was reorganized as a joint venture when Manitex International (NASDAQ:MNTX) purchased 51% of ASV from Terex in a negotiated transaction. ASV Holdings, Inc. completed an underwritten IPO on May 17, 2017 in which the Company sold 1.8 million shares and Manitex sold 2.0 million shares ($7/share) to institutional investors. We are listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “ASV”.

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
