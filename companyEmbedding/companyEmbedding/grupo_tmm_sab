Grupo TMM SAB



08/02/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 08/02/2016 16:35
Grupo TMM, TransCanada And Sierra Oil & Gas propose new refined products








(Mexico City, Agosto 2, 2016) - Grupo TMM, S.A.B. (OTC: GTMAY and BMV: TMM A; '), a Mexican maritime transportation and logistics company, today announced that in conjunction with TransCanada and Sierra Oil & Gas, they are proposing to jointly develop storage and transportation infrastructure to serve the growing demand for refined products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in the central region of Mexico.
      

        The proposed US$800 million project would be the largest single investment in refined products since the establishment of the Mexico energy reform. The project includes:
      


          A marine terminal in Tuxpan, Veracruz for offloading vessels with a draft of 14 meters, storage and distribution.
        

          An approximately 265 kilometer 100,000 barrels per day refined products pipeline parallel to TransCanada's recently awarded Tuxpan-Tula natural gas pipeline project.
        

          An inland distribution hub in central Mexico will provide excellent connectivity to the majority of the Mexico Valley market with access to major highways and distribution centers in the country.
        


        The Tuxpan-Central Mexico corridor is the ideal route to efficiently supply refined products in the region making this project a significant contribution to the existing refined products distribution chain in Mexico.
      

        The project brings together leaders in their own fields, and with its attributes, positions our project as the premier choice for fuel importers.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
