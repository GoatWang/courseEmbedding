History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.
The Initial Public Offering[edit]
With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989, acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) formed[edit]
In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans, which were supported by the Clinton Administration, helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.
Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002, Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company boasted 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.
Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino[edit]
On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.




Ferrellgas retailer, Sumpter Twp., MI


In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.
The Initial Public Offering[edit]
With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989, acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) formed[edit]
In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans, which were supported by the Clinton Administration, helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.
Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002, Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company boasted 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.
Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino[edit]
On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.

In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

At an All-Time Low, Is Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. a Buy?
The propane leader has struggled mightily in the last year. Is it a buying opportunity?











                Maxx Chatsko
            

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            Jul 11, 2017 at 9:43AM
            
            





If you used a Blue Rhino propane tank to fuel the grill at your Fourth of July cookout, then you were using a branded product from Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP). Despite the regional name recognition for several of its brands, the dividend stock is trading at all-time lows. That's quite a statement considering the company has been publicly traded since 1994.
The main reason for the company's stunning drop in the past 12 months is simple: The partnership cut its distribution payout by 80%. It was the right thing to do, but there's still a long road ahead before the company gets back on the right track. That puts investors in an awkward position. Given everything that has happened and looking ahead, is Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. stock a buy?

Image source: Getty Images.

The business
Last November, Ferrellgas Partners announced that it would be cutting its distribution payments from $2.05 per share to just $0.40 per share. That's because the company's debt grew 70% from fiscal yea 2013 to the fiscal year 2016 thanks to a mostly botched expansion into midstream operations. Revenue has only increased 3% in the same period. Therefore, it needs to free up operating cash flow to begin getting a handle on its deteriorating balance sheet. And it can only do that by drastically reducing its distribution.
Whether or not the move pays off in a reasonable amount of time depends on the health of the business. The company reports three segments. The core focus is, and always has been, propane and gas liquid sales, which comprised 70% of total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. The second largest segment is midstream operations, which has actually catalyzed the company's precipitous fall in the last year. The company tidies up smaller businesses and other loose ends in a segment called "other."
Here's how they stack up through the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, which concluded at the end of April.

Source: SEC filings.
Aside from an uptick in propane and gas liquids sales, investors witnessed a decline in revenue and gross profit from every other part of the business during the comparison period. However, the most important aspects of the business -- and its ability to pay down its debt -- are earnings and operating cash flow. Investors have mixed results to digest.
For instance, EPS during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 registered at $0.02, although that includes multiple quarters of getting the house in order. During the most recent quarter the company reported EPS of $0.07, which isn't close to historical levels but is better than reporting a net loss.

FGP data by YCharts





Then again, Ferrellgas Partners reported cash from operating activities of $118 million during the same nine-month period. That's well below the $220 million posted in the year-ago period. Although, once again, the most recent quarter carried most of the progress: $79 million of that total was generated in the most recent three month period. 
Is the stock a buy?
While I can see that this is a great opportunity to apply the "be greedy when others are fearful" investing adage, I'm not convinced that Ferrellgas Partners is a buy. It still needs to prove it can generate enough cash from operations to begin paying down its hefty debt pile and do so consistently -- meaning for several consecutive quarters. And that's the problem: All three business segments are sliding at exactly the wrong time. So, even though there may be opportunity to buy the stock at an all-time low, it's probably too risky for most investors.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.
The Initial Public Offering[edit]
With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989, acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) formed[edit]
In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans, which were supported by the Clinton Administration, helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.
Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002, Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company boasted 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.
Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino[edit]
On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.

In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.

In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

At an All-Time Low, Is Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. a Buy?
The propane leader has struggled mightily in the last year. Is it a buying opportunity?

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            Jul 11, 2017 at 9:43AM
            
            





If you used a Blue Rhino propane tank to fuel the grill at your Fourth of July cookout, then you were using a branded product from Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP). Despite the regional name recognition for several of its brands, the dividend stock is trading at all-time lows. That's quite a statement considering the company has been publicly traded since 1994.
The main reason for the company's stunning drop in the past 12 months is simple: The partnership cut its distribution payout by 80%. It was the right thing to do, but there's still a long road ahead before the company gets back on the right track. That puts investors in an awkward position. Given everything that has happened and looking ahead, is Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. stock a buy?

The business
Last November, Ferrellgas Partners announced that it would be cutting its distribution payments from $2.05 per share to just $0.40 per share. That's because the company's debt grew 70% from fiscal yea 2013 to the fiscal year 2016 thanks to a mostly botched expansion into midstream operations. Revenue has only increased 3% in the same period. Therefore, it needs to free up operating cash flow to begin getting a handle on its deteriorating balance sheet. And it can only do that by drastically reducing its distribution.
Whether or not the move pays off in a reasonable amount of time depends on the health of the business. The company reports three segments. The core focus is, and always has been, propane and gas liquid sales, which comprised 70% of total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. The second largest segment is midstream operations, which has actually catalyzed the company's precipitous fall in the last year. The company tidies up smaller businesses and other loose ends in a segment called "other."
Here's how they stack up through the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, which concluded at the end of April.

Aside from an uptick in propane and gas liquids sales, investors witnessed a decline in revenue and gross profit from every other part of the business during the comparison period. However, the most important aspects of the business -- and its ability to pay down its debt -- are earnings and operating cash flow. Investors have mixed results to digest.
For instance, EPS during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 registered at $0.02, although that includes multiple quarters of getting the house in order. During the most recent quarter the company reported EPS of $0.07, which isn't close to historical levels but is better than reporting a net loss.

FGP data by YCharts





Then again, Ferrellgas Partners reported cash from operating activities of $118 million during the same nine-month period. That's well below the $220 million posted in the year-ago period. Although, once again, the most recent quarter carried most of the progress: $79 million of that total was generated in the most recent three month period. 
Is the stock a buy?
While I can see that this is a great opportunity to apply the "be greedy when others are fearful" investing adage, I'm not convinced that Ferrellgas Partners is a buy. It still needs to prove it can generate enough cash from operations to begin paying down its hefty debt pile and do so consistently -- meaning for several consecutive quarters. And that's the problem: All three business segments are sliding at exactly the wrong time. So, even though there may be opportunity to buy the stock at an all-time low, it's probably too risky for most investors.

Better Buy: Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. vs. AmeriGas Partners, L.P.
The propane business has been tough lately, which is why the steady performer wins over the fixer-upper in this pairing.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jun 1, 2017 at 8:09AM
            
            





AmeriGas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:APU) summed up the problem facing the propane distribution industry when it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings: It was the warmest second quarter on record. In fact, it's been relatively mild the last few years, depressing demand and clouding the outlook for propane. Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP) is facing the same demon, but it's also dealing with two more of its making. Here's why AmeriGas is the better option for most investors.
That was a mistake
In mid-2014, Ferrellgas began building an oil and gas midstream business with the acquisition of Sable Environmental. Over the next couple of years, it added to that division through additional acquisitions. However, when it lost a key customer, the midstream investment quickly turned into a liability. The distribution was slashed a painful 80% at the end of 2016, the board dismissed the CEO who orchestrated the midstream investment, and the former CEO (company founder James Ferrell) was brought back to right the ship.

There are two main problems faced by the company today. The first is an underperforming midstream business (around 15% of revenues in the fiscal second quarter). Although propane tends to be a relatively stable operation, Ferrellgas needs to fix the problems in midstream or jettison those assets. Neither is likely to be easy to do.  
The second problem is related to the first: Ferrellgas has too much debt. That's why the partnership cut the distribution -- so it could push more cash toward the debt overhang. Crucial, as the company's midstream purchases increased debt by roughly 80% between 2014 and 2016.  
So, Ferrellgas has a troubled business and too much debt. It knows about these problems and is working to fix them. I believe it will be able to do so, making it an interesting turnaround play. However, if you're only looking for propane exposure, it's a high-risk way to get it because of these self-imposed problems. 
Rolling along
Warm weather led to a 6% decline in propane gallons sold at AmeriGas Partners in the fiscal second quarter. Warm weather and weak volumes have been a trend for a couple of years now. It's a headwind every propane company has faced, but it's important to point out that it's the only significant headwind AmeriGas is dealing with right now.   
In fact, AmeriGas just increased its distribution for the 13th consecutive year. It was a modest 1% hike, but it was the thought that counted. Effectively, management was saying that distribution increases are significant even when the partnership is facing near-term adversity.    
To be fair, long-term debt is a substantial 70% of the capital structure. But that's a lot better than Ferrellgas' capital structure: Long-term debt is over 100% of its capital structure because midstream asset writedowns pushed unitholder equity into negative territory. AmeriGas has also been pushing out its debt maturities, giving it added breathing room for an improvement in the weather. At this point, it doesn't have any significant maturities until 2022. Along the way, it also managed to lower its average interest rate (a double win).  

AmeriGas has pushed out its debt and lowered its average interest rate. Image source: AmeriGas Partners, L.P.

Meanwhile, AmeriGas continues to acquire new propane businesses to expand its industry footprint. Note that it is already the largest propane distributor, with a 15% market share. So, it's rolling with the punches on the weather, so it will be in a better industry position when things get chilly again.  
To be honest, the mild weather stress that propane companies are facing is theoretically a great opportunity for AmeriGas since it increases the likelihood of mom-and-pop competitors selling out. While Ferrellgas is continuing to expand, too, AmeriGas is doing so from a much stronger financial position.  
It's also worthwhile to note that AmeriGas is a part of the UGI (NYSE:UGI) family. That diversified natural gas and propane company is AmeriGas' general partner and owns roughly 26% of the partnership's units. So, unlike Ferrellgas, AmeriGas has a strong parent backing its business and growth.  





One problem or three?
Both AmeriGas and Ferrellgas are dealing with warm weather. However, Ferrellgas is also dealing with too much debt and a troubled midstream business. It's a turnaround play that might interest more aggressive investors. But if that's not your thing -- and it shouldn't be for most investors -- then AmeriGas is clearly the better option, here. Weather is an issue, but AmeriGas appears to be handling it with relative ease. And you'll get a nice 8.6% distribution yield while you wait for colder weather to arrive.
