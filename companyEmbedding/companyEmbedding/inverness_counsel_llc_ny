Keeping You Informed







Traditionally, investment management and wealth management have been practiced separately, leaving clients with the burden of managing complex financial affairs.  At Inverness, our unified approach to wealth management is designed to address all of the complexities relating to money.   
 
The tailored wealth and investment management programs we create for each client benefit from our team's broad range of experiences, skill sets and disciplines.   However, to be truly successful, we believe we must engage not only with our clients but also with their stakeholders, which may include family members and their trusted advisors, - such as lawyers and accountants.
 
By working with all of the interested parties and considering all of the issues connected with a client's wealth, we can craft unique solutions.  Through an ongoing communication process, we monitor these plans and make adjustments to meet the changing environment.  Our focus is on empowering clients to achieve their goals, whatever they may be.

How to Understand Investment Strategies






At Inverness, our investment plans are highly customized.  Client assets are actively managed in separate accounts with investment objectives that focus on each client's unique set of goals and objectives, both long-term and short-term.  We take into account liquidity needs, the impact of legacy positions, and other client-specific limitations or issues.  We use these goals and considerations to build a unique investment plan for each client.  The results are measured on a regular basis, and the plan is adjusted as necessary.
 
On average, members of our Investment Committee have more than 20 years of experience actively managing equity and fixed income investments.  To support and complement our internal investment strategy, we have for three decades provided access to a group of third-party managers who focus on investment strategies and geographic regions that are different from our own.
 
As of December 31, 2016, Inverness managed over $2.7 billion in client assets.  In addition to our work with high net worth individuals, families, and trusts, our institutional team has managed portfolios for the same public pension plans for more than 35 years.

History
Our Team






Many members of our team have worked together and with the same clients for more than 20 years.  Such long-term relationships are rare today, but we believe they provide a valuable perspective and help to explain why many clients ask members of the firm to serve as trustees and board members.  Our relationships with our clients, combined with our competencies, provide superior outcomes.

Philip S. Lawrence
Philip is the President and CEO, and is a member of the Investment Committee. In addition to managing portfolios for high net worth clients, he serves as a trustee and officer for various client family trusts and foundations. Prior to joining Inverness in 1992, Philip founded his own company, VideoBook, in 1989. He worked in private banking at JP Morgan from 1987 to 1990.
 
Philip earned a BA from Columbia University in 1987. He serves as President of the Board for SKIP of New York, a non-profit organization that focuses on restoring and maintaining the primacy of family and home for sick and/or developmentally disabled children in the state of New York.
