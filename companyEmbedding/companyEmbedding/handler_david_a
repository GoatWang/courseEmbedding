• "Painting a Picture"  Like a landscape painter, investors need to envision the whole picture before it is fully painted and realize that it’s never static, writes Michael Wilson, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Morgan Stanley & Co. He advises adapting to recent changes by adding exposure to some asset classes that have lagged this year but should do better as the cycle matures. • “Climbing the Last Wall of Worry”  S&P For the past six months, improving growth and contained inflation helped push asset prices higher, writes Andrew Sheets, chief global cross-asset strategist for Morgan Stanley & Co. As he expects improving growth and contained inflation for the next six months, asset prices should continue their run.   • “10 Reasons to Doubt Legislative Optimism on Tax Reform”  MS & Co. Strategist Michael Zezas still thinks some form of tax reform will happen, but not as quickly as some press reports and leading Republicans say it will. Zezas lays out his reasoning. 
• Plus, look for more on economics, equities and fixed income investments, and a Q&A featuring Catherine Wood, founder of ARK Investment Management, who discusses thematic investing and the disruption of new technologies.Check the background of our Firm and Investment Professionals on FINRA's BrokerCheck.David L.

Air Handlers


GET BETTER AIR CIRCULATION WITH A LENNOX AIR HANDLER
A great fit for all your home’s heating and air conditioning needs, an air handler helps provide clean, filtered air and circulate it around your home. This system is usually combined with a heat pump for maximum electricity savings in a split system, but they also can be combined with air conditioners.
Since your air is constantly in motion, when paired with the right filtration system, air handlers can improve circulation and indoor air quality, helping prevent pollutants and allergens from building up inside your home. Air handlers are energy efficient, too, with certain models using variable speed technology to alter the necessary air speed according to your needs. This helps saves energy, which translates to lower energy expenses. Greater control, enhanced comfort and reduced energy costs – it doesn’t get much better than that!
We’re certified to service all brands of air handlers, like Amana, Bryant, Carrier, Lennox, Rheen, Trane and York, so you know you’ll be getting the finest furnace or air conditioning repair available. And with a 1 year warranty on all our repairs, you have nothing to worry about. Your comfort should never be threatened, which is why we’re available 24/7/365. Need an AC professional now? Call 740-594-8381 or 740-654-4328 and we’ll be there in no time.

David Handler













                    
                    I was born and raised in Los Angeles and wrote two critically acclaimed novels about growing up there, "Kiddo" and "Boss," before I resorted to a life of crime fiction.My first foray, which you may remember, featured the dapper celebrity ghostwriter Stewart 'Hoagy' Hoag and his faithful, neurotic basset hound Lulu.  I wrote eight novels between the years 1988 and 1997 about Hoagy, a fallen literary wunderkind turned pen for hire who travels the underbelly of show business helping famous stars tell their life stories, secrets and all.   Generally, there are plenty of people who wanted those secrets to stay safely buried.  Generally, our jaded hero knows how to dig them out.  My first Hoagy, "The Man Who Died Laughing," was nominated for an Anthony Award.   My best known in the series,  "The Man Who Would Be F. Scott Fitzgerald," won an Edgar and an American Mystery Award.  I'm thrilled to report that I've revived the series and my newest Hoagy, "The Girl With Kaleidoscope Eyes," will be published in August of 2017 by William Morrow.  I couldn't be more excited about this book, which sends Hoagy and Lulu out to Hollywood in search of Richard Aintree, the legendary American novelist who disappeared more than 20 years ago.  It also brings Hoagy in contact with Aintree's daughter, Reggie, who just happens to be the first great love of his life. Want to catch up? Thanks to the good folks at Mysteriouspress.com and Open Road Media all eight of my Hoagy novels are now available on Kindle.  Check 'em out.   You'll never find another wise-cracking hero quite like Hoagy. A lot of my insights into the world of show business came from the 20 years I spent writing for television and films on both coasts. Remember the sitcom "Kate and Allie" with Jane Curtin and Susan St. James? I was a member of the original writing staff that created that show.These days, I live in a 200-year-old carriage house in a quaint, ultra-WASPY little historic New England village.   Not surprisingly, I ended up launching a second mystery series that takes place here.  Over the past fifteen years I've written eleven retro-cozy murder mysteries set in a quaint, ultra-WASPY little historic New England village.   I call it Dorset.   It's a place where everyone knows everything about everyone ' or at least they think they do.   Trust me, they don't.   Dorset is a place full of secrets, many of them deadly.   That's where my deliciously mismatched heroes come in, both of them strangers in a very strange land.   Mitch Berger, a pudgy Jewish widower, is the lead film critic for the most prestigious and therefore lowest paying of New York's three daily newspapers. Desiree Mitry is an alluring beautiful Connecticut State Trooper who happens to be black, a gifted artist and strangely drawn to Mitch.   Under normal circumstances, these are two people whose paths would never cross.   But absolutely nothing about Dorset is normal. I started the series in 2001 with "The Cold Blue Blood," which was nominated for a Dilys Award.      My latest, "The Lavender Lane Lothario," was published in February of 2016.  You absolutely don't have to read the Berger-Mitry books in order, but you'll find it a kick to follow the unfolding romance if you do.   Personally, I've found them to be a real treat.   I get a chance to dissect the village and the people where I actually live.   Absolutely everyone in town reads them.   And I have fun bringing my own subversive contemporary edge to the classic old-school village murder mystery. The books feel real fresh to me.   I hope you like them. In the summer of 2013 I launched another series featuring the feisty 137-pound New York City private eye Benji Golden.  Benji specializes in finding missing teenagers.  The first novel in the series is called "Runaway Man."  I published a sequel, "Phantom Angel," in 2015.  I promise you will love Benji.Do you like political thrillers? If so, I took some time off between series a few years back to co-author an international bestselling page-turner called Gideon under the name Russell Andrews.   I promise you it'll knock your socks off. I've also taken the time to write some short fiction.   Three have been included in anthologies -- "Opening Shots Volume Two," edited by Lawrence Block, "A Hot and Sultry Night for Crime," edited by edited by Jeffrey Deaver and "Damn Near Dead 2," edited by Bill Crider. -30-

Air Handlers


GET BETTER AIR CIRCULATION WITH A LENNOX AIR HANDLER
A great fit for all your home’s heating and air conditioning needs, an air handler helps provide clean, filtered air and circulate it around your home. This system is usually combined with a heat pump for maximum electricity savings in a split system, but they also can be combined with air conditioners.
Since your air is constantly in motion, when paired with the right filtration system, air handlers can improve circulation and indoor air quality, helping prevent pollutants and allergens from building up inside your home. Air handlers are energy efficient, too, with certain models using variable speed technology to alter the necessary air speed according to your needs. This helps saves energy, which translates to lower energy expenses. Greater control, enhanced comfort and reduced energy costs – it doesn’t get much better than that!
We’re certified to service all brands of air handlers, like Amana, Bryant, Carrier, Lennox, Rheen, Trane and York, so you know you’ll be getting the finest furnace or air conditioning repair available. And with a 1 year warranty on all our repairs, you have nothing to worry about. Your comfort should never be threatened, which is why we’re available 24/7/365. Need an AC professional now? Call 740-594-8381 or 740-654-4328 and we’ll be there in no time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
