NEW YORK, May 31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- SQN Capital Management, LLC (SQN) announced today that its fifth program and second public equipment leasing and asset investment fund, SQN AIF IV, L.P., received sufficient subscription proceeds to break escrow and conducted its first closing. 
SQN AIF IV, L.P. is being offered through registered investment advisors and independent broker/dealers. The $200 million offering was declared effective by the SEC on April 2, 2013.
Jeremiah Silkowski, CEO of SQN, said, "We attribute this milestone to our solid reputation among financial advisors and institutional investors that see SQN Capital Management as the manager of a new breed of equipment leasing programs that bring a much shorter lifecycle, high-level of investor alignment and lower cost structure to the direct investment community."
