Portfolio Management - Jacobson & Schmitt Advisors



























































Schedule a ConsultationClient Login








Portfolio Management









Identifying Investment Opportunities Around the Globe
Based on decades of investment experience, our team has created a powerful investment process that helps us optimize our clients’ net worth and achieve their financial goals. We look for three key qualities when choosing companies in which to invest:

The potential to deliver long-term, above-average returns
Forward-looking management and industry-leading performance
Contribution to social and environmental well-being by practicing corporate social responsibility

“At JSA, we treat our clients’ investments as though they were our own.”
The first two criteria ensure the financial viability of our investments. The third ensures that we feel good about our investments. When companies meet these three criteria, not only do they have the potential to deliver better returns, they are companies we can be proud to own.
As a rule, we search for opportunities on a global scale, including large and small companies, across many industries and countries. We try to shape our holdings by taking part in important global economic and industry trends.
Portfolio Allocations
Typically, our hands-on financial planning process will result in one of four portfolio allocations. The portfolio will usually consist of 20 to 30 stocks that we’re proud to own. In cases where individual stocks are inefficient, index funds may be used. We add bonds to portfolios as needed to reduce volatility and increase income.
Our advisors will work with you one-on-one to help you determine which portfolio is ideal for your individual investment goals:









Growth
Do you have a time horizon greater than 10 years and can tolerate wide fluctuations in market value?


Moderate Growth
Do you have a time horizon greater than seven years, and can withstand significant fluctuations in market value?


Growth and Income
Do you have a time horizon between five and seven years, and prefer more moderate fluctuation in the market values?


Income
Do you have a time horizon of less than five years, and are either seeking income or want to minimize market value fluctuation?

Why JSA









We Deliver Responsibility, Transparency, and a Passion for Your Success
For over 20 years, our investment team has worked hard to deliver thoughtful financial advice that gives individuals and small entities the same investment advantages that larger investors enjoy. But the biggest difference in our firm lies in our values and our culture.
“We want our clients to realize their financial goals, and then a little bit more. It’s the little bit more that drives us.”
We’re often asked, “Why should we work with you?” Our response is that you’ll get so much more than just investment advice.
We’ve built a company around the idea that we hold a deep responsibility to our clients. We think like investors, not sales people, which means we won’t try to sell you unnecessary products or get more business from you that doesn’t serve your needs. Instead, we’re laser-focused on successful outcomes and, hopefully, a little bit more. It’s the “more” that drives us. We’re confident you’ll agree.
Some of the keys to our successful client relationships include:

Our unwavering passion for your financial success
Our relentless pursuit of the best possible investment opportunities
Direct access to our team of advisors and our firm’s principals
Recommending only investments that we ourselves are proud to own
Our proven history of smart investing in responsible companies
Tailoring each portfolio to our clients’ individual needs
Fair and transparent pricing with no hidden fees
