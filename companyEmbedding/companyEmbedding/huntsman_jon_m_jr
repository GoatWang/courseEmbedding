Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. (born March 26, 1960) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as the 16th Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, and as United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993, and China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[1] In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2] It has been reported he was chosen to be the next Ambassador to Russia in March 2017.[3]
Huntsman has served in every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He also served as CEO of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama.
While Governor, he was named Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States.[4] He won re-election in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and left office with approval ratings over 80%.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California.[6] His mother is Karen (née Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight,[7] and his father is billionaire businessman and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. of the Huntsman Corporation.[8] Through his father, Huntsman Jr. is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.[9]
At age 15 in 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[10] Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City, but dropped out before graduating to pursue his passion as a keyboard player in a rock band called "Wizard".[11][12] Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987.
Political career[edit]
While visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman that he was secretly traveling to China.[13] He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.[14] In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[15]
Ambassador to Singapore[edit]
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990.[14] He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991.[14] In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore,[16] which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.[17] When questioned by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, he said that he had been the chairman of Utah's presidential fundraising committee and had donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign, an amount that Sarbanes described as "not a large amount really".[18] At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.[19]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as President, the Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed U.S. Ambassador to China.[20] In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.[21] On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States Trade Representatives in his administration;[22] he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.[14]
Governor of Utah[edit]
Main articles: Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 and Utah gubernatorial election, 2008
In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah.[26] In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%.[27] In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr.[28] In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.[29]
Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as Governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%.[5][30][31] Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States.[4] Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top 3 state to do business in.[32] The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of "B"; the institute gave him an "A" on tax policy and an "F" on spending policy.[33]
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey, Utah was ranked number one in the nation in job growth during Huntsman's tenure, a rate of 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. However, according to the Bureau's Current Employment Statistics survey, Utah ranked number four in the country in job creation, with 4.8% growth. Utah trailed Texas (6.5%), North Dakota (7.5%), and Wyoming (9.5%).[34]
The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that "tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million." Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.[35]
During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $16.7 to $22.8 billion.[36] Utah saw spending increases higher than inflation and in 2006 he proposed the largest state budget in the state's history.[33]
Huntsman supported Cap and trade policies, and as governor signed the Western Climate Initiative.[37] He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage.[38] He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws.[39] In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act which he said was "the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program is open to all current public school children as well as some children already in private school." The voucher law was repealed in a public referendum.[40]
Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign,[41][42] while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney.[43] Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007.[44] At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.[45]
Ambassador to China[edit]

President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,[46] which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009.[47] On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman[48] and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.[49]
Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.[50]
In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the "Jasmine Revolution".[51][52] On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the Wangfujing shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date. When approached by an onlooker asking why he was there, Huntsman replied, "I'm just here to look around." When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area. Photographs of Huntsman at the scene and a video of the encounter, which further accused Huntsman and the United States of attempting to instigate an anti-government revolution in China, were posted on a Chinese website.[53] The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been "unaware" of the planned protest, and happened to be "strolling through the area on a family outing".[54] Huntsman's Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines.[55]
Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.
2012 presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Jon Huntsman presidential campaign, 2012

Background[edit]
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,[56][57] and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.[58] Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.[59]
Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."[60] On November 12, 2008 Politico called him a possible 2012 contender.[61] Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.[43][62]
Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."[63] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012."[64]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.[65] On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."[66] The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".[67]
A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position. ... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.[68] The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.[69]
Campaign[edit]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time.[70] Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.[71][72][73]
On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC.[74] On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, during an interview with Harold Evans, he said he would announce his campaign for president on June 21.[75][76]
Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.[77][78] After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.[79]
Post-campaign politics[edit]
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show Morning Joe on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process.

I think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.[80]
The Republican National Committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March.[81] In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.

In early November 2012, just days before Barack Obama was re-elected as President, the Associated Press named Huntsman as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State.[82] This speculation was echoed by various media outlets[83] particularly after Huntsman came to the defense of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, describing the criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack as being "overblown."[84]
On November 20, 2012, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was "honest about our concerns about Huntsman" and that Huntsman "would have been a very tough candidate."[85]
In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2]
Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.[86] In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump,[87] but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy [88]
In November 2016, Huntsman "said he’s weighing a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, depending in part on whether fellow Republican Orrin Hatch decides to seek an eighth term."[89]
Possible Trump administration position[edit]
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump Transition team as a possible choice for Secretary of State in 2017.[90] Rex Tillerson was chosen ten days later.
Huntsman defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process.[90] Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.[90]
It was reported on March 8, 2017 that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia.[91]
Political views[edit]
Huntsman has been described by the Huffington Post as "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama"[92] and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.[93]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.[94] In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".[95]
According to Haley Barbour, former Governor of Mississippi:

Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state—elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.[96]

Fiscal policy[edit]




Huntsman speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, in 2009


In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.[97] However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."[97] He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".[98]
As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with." The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."[99]
In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.[100]

Social issues[edit]
As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.[101] Huntsman actively supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah,[102] but not same-sex marriage.[103]
In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman expressed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience."[104][105]
In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[106]
Environment and energy[edit]
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases.[107] He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."[107] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment."[108]
Later that year, in response to perceived anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, he tweeted: "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." [109] Soon after, however, he clarified this position by stating: "There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue. We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."[110]
Foreign policy[edit]




Huntsman meets with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in June 2016


Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."[111] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.[112]
Immigration[edit]
In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.[113] In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to "driving-privilege cards", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes.[114] As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.[115]
Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, "as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice."[116] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence.[117] Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.[118]
Huntsman supported the DREAM Act which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.[119]
Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property[edit]
Huntsman is the co-head, along with Dennis C. Blair, of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.[120]
Business career[edit]
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company. Other organizations he has served include the Utah Opera, Envision Utah, the Coalition for Utah's Future, and KSL-TV's Family Now campaign.
In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.[121]
Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford's Executive Chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman's global knowledge and experience – especially in Asia – as well as his tenure as the Governor of Utah.[122] Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.[123]
On March 23, 2012, the Washington Post reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the issue of the vacant presidency of the World Bank. According to the Post, a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.[124]
Personal life[edit]




Huntsman with his wife Mary Kaye in May 2014


Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, Mary Kaye, have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth ("Liddy"; b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India).[125]
Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary Parley Pratt, is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.[126][127][128] Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and that Romney's selection was "precooked".[129] As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to New York Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. New York wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."[129] Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.[129]
He is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard.[130] He has cited Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep as his favorite bands during college. On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by progressive metal band Dream Theater. Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating "Dream Theater Day" on that date for the state of Utah.[131] He also is a fan of avant-garde musician Captain Beefheart, citing Trout Mask Replica (1969) as his favorite album by Beefheart.[132] Huntsman also joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah.[133]
Huntsman has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees,[134] including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from Snow College in 2005,[135] an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Westminster College in 2008,[136] an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Utah in 2010,[137] an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010,[138] and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011.[139] He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.[140]
In 2007 he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA.[141] He is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution Asia Policy Board, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Religious views[edit]
Huntsman was brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, "I believe in God. I'm a good Christian. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."[142]
However, he told Newsweek in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.[143] In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".[144][145] Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating: "Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." [146]
Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that global warming was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman tweeted, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."[147] He said, "The minute that the Republican Party becomes... the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."[148]

Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. (born March 26, 1960) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as the 16th Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, and as United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993, and China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[1] In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2] It has been reported he was chosen to be the next Ambassador to Russia in March 2017.[3]
Huntsman has served in every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He also served as CEO of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama.
While Governor, he was named Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States.[4] He won re-election in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and left office with approval ratings over 80%.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California.[6] His mother is Karen (née Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight,[7] and his father is billionaire businessman and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. of the Huntsman Corporation.[8] Through his father, Huntsman Jr. is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.[9]
At age 15 in 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[10] Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City, but dropped out before graduating to pursue his passion as a keyboard player in a rock band called "Wizard".[11][12] Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987.
Political career[edit]
While visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman that he was secretly traveling to China.[13] He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.[14] In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[15]
Ambassador to Singapore[edit]
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990.[14] He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991.[14] In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore,[16] which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.[17] When questioned by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, he said that he had been the chairman of Utah's presidential fundraising committee and had donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign, an amount that Sarbanes described as "not a large amount really".[18] At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.[19]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as President, the Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed U.S. Ambassador to China.[20] In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.[21] On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States Trade Representatives in his administration;[22] he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.[14]
Governor of Utah[edit]
Main articles: Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 and Utah gubernatorial election, 2008
In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah.[26] In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%.[27] In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr.[28] In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.[29]
Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as Governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%.[5][30][31] Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States.[4] Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top 3 state to do business in.[32] The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of "B"; the institute gave him an "A" on tax policy and an "F" on spending policy.[33]
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey, Utah was ranked number one in the nation in job growth during Huntsman's tenure, a rate of 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. However, according to the Bureau's Current Employment Statistics survey, Utah ranked number four in the country in job creation, with 4.8% growth. Utah trailed Texas (6.5%), North Dakota (7.5%), and Wyoming (9.5%).[34]
The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that "tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million." Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.[35]
During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $16.7 to $22.8 billion.[36] Utah saw spending increases higher than inflation and in 2006 he proposed the largest state budget in the state's history.[33]
Huntsman supported Cap and trade policies, and as governor signed the Western Climate Initiative.[37] He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage.[38] He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws.[39] In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act which he said was "the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program is open to all current public school children as well as some children already in private school." The voucher law was repealed in a public referendum.[40]
Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign,[41][42] while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney.[43] Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007.[44] At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.[45]
Ambassador to China[edit]

President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,[46] which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009.[47] On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman[48] and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.[49]
Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.[50]
In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the "Jasmine Revolution".[51][52] On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the Wangfujing shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date. When approached by an onlooker asking why he was there, Huntsman replied, "I'm just here to look around." When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area. Photographs of Huntsman at the scene and a video of the encounter, which further accused Huntsman and the United States of attempting to instigate an anti-government revolution in China, were posted on a Chinese website.[53] The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been "unaware" of the planned protest, and happened to be "strolling through the area on a family outing".[54] Huntsman's Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines.[55]
Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.
2012 presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Jon Huntsman presidential campaign, 2012

Background[edit]
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,[56][57] and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.[58] Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.[59]
Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."[60] On November 12, 2008 Politico called him a possible 2012 contender.[61] Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.[43][62]
Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."[63] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012."[64]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.[65] On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."[66] The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".[67]
A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position. ... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.[68] The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.[69]
Campaign[edit]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time.[70] Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.[71][72][73]
On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC.[74] On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, during an interview with Harold Evans, he said he would announce his campaign for president on June 21.[75][76]
Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.[77][78] After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.[79]
Post-campaign politics[edit]
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show Morning Joe on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process.

I think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.[80]
The Republican National Committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March.[81] In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.

In early November 2012, just days before Barack Obama was re-elected as President, the Associated Press named Huntsman as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State.[82] This speculation was echoed by various media outlets[83] particularly after Huntsman came to the defense of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, describing the criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack as being "overblown."[84]
On November 20, 2012, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was "honest about our concerns about Huntsman" and that Huntsman "would have been a very tough candidate."[85]
In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2]
Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.[86] In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump,[87] but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy [88]
In November 2016, Huntsman "said he’s weighing a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, depending in part on whether fellow Republican Orrin Hatch decides to seek an eighth term."[89]
Possible Trump administration position[edit]
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump Transition team as a possible choice for Secretary of State in 2017.[90] Rex Tillerson was chosen ten days later.
Huntsman defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process.[90] Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.[90]
It was reported on March 8, 2017 that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia.[91]
Political views[edit]
Huntsman has been described by the Huffington Post as "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama"[92] and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.[93]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.[94] In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".[95]
According to Haley Barbour, former Governor of Mississippi:

Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state—elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.[96]

Fiscal policy[edit]




Huntsman speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, in 2009


In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.[97] However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."[97] He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".[98]
As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with." The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."[99]
In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.[100]

Social issues[edit]
As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.[101] Huntsman actively supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah,[102] but not same-sex marriage.[103]
In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman expressed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience."[104][105]
In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[106]
Environment and energy[edit]
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases.[107] He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."[107] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment."[108]
Later that year, in response to perceived anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, he tweeted: "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." [109] Soon after, however, he clarified this position by stating: "There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue. We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."[110]
Foreign policy[edit]

Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."[111] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.[112]
Immigration[edit]
In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.[113] In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to "driving-privilege cards", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes.[114] As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.[115]
Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, "as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice."[116] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence.[117] Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.[118]
Huntsman supported the DREAM Act which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.[119]
Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property[edit]
Huntsman is the co-head, along with Dennis C. Blair, of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.[120]
Business career[edit]
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company. Other organizations he has served include the Utah Opera, Envision Utah, the Coalition for Utah's Future, and KSL-TV's Family Now campaign.
In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.[121]
Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford's Executive Chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman's global knowledge and experience – especially in Asia – as well as his tenure as the Governor of Utah.[122] Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.[123]
On March 23, 2012, the Washington Post reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the issue of the vacant presidency of the World Bank. According to the Post, a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.[124]
Personal life[edit]




Huntsman with his wife Mary Kaye in May 2014


Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, Mary Kaye, have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth ("Liddy"; b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India).[125]
Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary Parley Pratt, is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.[126][127][128] Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and that Romney's selection was "precooked".[129] As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to New York Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. New York wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."[129] Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.[129]
He is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard.[130] He has cited Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep as his favorite bands during college. On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by progressive metal band Dream Theater. Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating "Dream Theater Day" on that date for the state of Utah.[131] He also is a fan of avant-garde musician Captain Beefheart, citing Trout Mask Replica (1969) as his favorite album by Beefheart.[132] Huntsman also joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah.[133]
Huntsman has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees,[134] including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from Snow College in 2005,[135] an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Westminster College in 2008,[136] an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Utah in 2010,[137] an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010,[138] and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011.[139] He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.[140]
In 2007 he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA.[141] He is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution Asia Policy Board, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Religious views[edit]
Huntsman was brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, "I believe in God. I'm a good Christian. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."[142]
However, he told Newsweek in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.[143] In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".[144][145] Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating: "Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." [146]
Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that global warming was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman tweeted, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."[147] He said, "The minute that the Republican Party becomes... the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."[148]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Huntsman Runs on His Name, and His Father’s

SALT LAKE CITY — Jon M. Huntsman Jr. was 10 years old when his father packed up their growing family to move east in 1970, leaving behind his fledgling company to work for President Richard M. Nixon.A driven businessman with deep roots in the Mormon Church, the elder Huntsman found little to like about his experience in the Nixon White House. It was poorly run, in his view — not at all like a business — and he felt terrorized by H. R. Haldeman, the mercurial chief of staff.“You asked me what I took out,” he told an interviewer years later. “I didn’t take anything but fear out.”Yet Mr. Huntsman did leave Washington with something that proved valuable when he resettled his family here: a thick Rolodex and a deep understanding of politics. In the years that followed, as he became a billionaire industrialist, a philanthropist, a campaign donor and one of Utah’s most powerful men, his connections and wealth proved critical in carving a path into politics for his namesake and eldest son.

Today the younger Huntsman is a Republican candidate for president at the back of a crowded pack. He is best known as a former Utah governor, conversant in Mandarin and politically moderate, who crossed party lines to become President Obama’s ambassador to China. On the campaign trail, he has cultivated a reputation as “the civility candidate.” Continue reading the main story

But here in Utah, where many still call him Junior, he remains, for better or worse, Jon Huntsman Sr.’s son. It is both his blessing and his burden.The father-son bond preoccupies political circles here. Some say Mr. Huntsman, who has alternated between the family business and public service — including a stint as ambassador to Singapore at age 32 — has been groomed for politics. Some see him as struggling to emerge from his father’s shadow, or wonder if, in pursuing the presidency, he is chasing his father’s dream.Mr. Huntsman, 51, says he is pursuing nobody’s dream but his own. He spent last week in New Hampshire, trying to revive a campaign facing single-digit poll numbers and internal strife. Walking the streets of Manchester, asking residents “humbly for your vote,” he cut a slight, gentle figure, displaying none of the swagger that a life of privilege can sometimes bring.“He’s my best friend, he’s a father, he’s been a mentor,” Mr. Huntsman said in an interview. “He set a great example and a high bar in life.”

As founder and chairman of the Huntsman Corporation (the company is run by Peter Huntsman, Jon Jr.’s brother), the elder Huntsman presides over a global chemical manufacturer with 2010 revenues of $9.3 billion. Having briefly flirted with a run for governor in 1988, he has worked over the years to ease his son’s path, according to those who know them both.In Washington, allies like Jake Garn, a Republican former senator from Utah, who later worked for the Huntsman Corporation, recommended Mr. Huntsman for jobs. In Utah, the father quietly pressed state leaders to install the son as the head of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics — a job that ultimately went to Mitt Romney, one of Mr. Huntsman’s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. He has been a financial backer of his son’s campaigns.“This is the son who bears his name,” said Tim Chambless, a University of Utah political scientist who has observed the Huntsman clan for 40 years, “and the father for many, many years has been cultivating, helping, expediting, opening doors that his very competent and able son can walk through.”

The elder Huntsman declined to be interviewed for this article.“I certainly plead guilty to loving and supporting and encouraging Jon Jr.,” he told The Salt Lake Tribune last month. But, noting his son’s “remarkable appointments” and landslide re-election in 2008, he added, “When people say I’ve orchestrated some of these things, it’s a complete impossibility to have great achievements like that from a father.” Utah RoyaltyAmerican politics has long been rife with dynasties — the names Adams, Roosevelt, Kennedy and Bush leap to mind. But in Utah, where politics and business are deeply entwined with the Mormon faith, there is no dynasty quite like the Huntsmans.“If we picked a royal family in Utah,” said Ted Wilson, a Democratic former Salt Lake City mayor, “it would be the Huntsmans.”Mr. Huntsman’s mother, Karen — just as ambitious for her children as is her husband, many here say — was the daughter of one of 12 Mormon “apostles” who serve under the church president. Mr. Huntsman Sr., descended from Mormon pioneers, is revered for the hundreds of millions of dollars he has given to charity.It is impossible to spend any time in Utah without stumbling across the Huntsman name. There are Huntsman teacher awards, Huntsman sporting events, a Huntsman arena and the gleaming glass and granite Huntsman Cancer Institute, the crown jewel of the family’s philanthropy.“He had 94 percent name ID the day he started,” said Nolan Karras, who lost to Mr. Huntsman in a primary for governor. “I had people say to me, ‘I’d like to vote for you, but my mother just got out of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, I’ve just got to vote for Jon.’ ”The family fortune grew out of the elder Huntsman’s invention of the plastic foam “clamshell” container for McDonald’s Big Macs. The son remembers the 1970s as the “go-go years,” when his father was struggling to build a business.

Their two years in Washington, where the elder Huntsman eventually became staff secretary to the president, left an impression. Young Jon Jr. met the president — “I remember a certain stiffness and formality,” he said — and trusted aides like Henry A. Kissinger and Alexander M. Haig. (Years later, as a Mormon missionary in Taipei, Taiwan, he told a friend Mr. Haig was his “political idol.”)

By 1978, the family home in the foothills of the Wasatch mountain range here was a magnet for budding musicians, including Jon Jr., a keyboard whiz who could play almost anything, from Emerson, Lake and Palmer to Chopin. He ran for senior class president in high school, but lost. Later, he dropped out to join a rock ’n’ roll band — a test, but not a break, of the father-son bond. (He went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, his father’s alma mater.)“I think he kind of always in the back of his mind heard his dad’s voice,” said Howard Sharp, a bandmate. “We talked about if the band didn’t work out, what would we do? Jon talked about going to Germany to work in his dad’s factories.”

Over the next two decades, Mr. Huntsman held a string of government jobs under President Ronald Reagan and both President Bushes: advance man, deputy assistant commerce secretary, ambassador to Singapore, trade ambassador. He has gotten good reviews.“Competent, capable and hardworking, flashes of real brilliance and just a very nice guy,” said Wayne Berman, who hired him at the Commerce Department, yet backs Mr. Romney. A Network of TiesAt each turn, Mr. Huntsman’s family network played a role. One former official during the Reagan and first Bush administrations remembers the elder Huntsman seeking specific jobs for his son. “He doesn’t take no for an answer,” said the former official, speaking anonymously to avoid drawing the anger of the family.Mr. Garn, the former senator, said he spoke to Reagan about Mr. Huntsman after the young man sought his help. Fred Malek, a Nixon administration colleague of the father’s, recommended the son as ambassador to Singapore.“Our families have been very close,” Mr. Malek said, adding that he saw Mr. Huntsman as “a bright, kind of earnest young man, cut out of the father’s cloth.”Mr. Huntsman acknowledges that his father’s “vast network” has helped open doors. But what matters, he says, is how he fared when he walked through them.“You either rise to the ability to perform,” he said, “or you don’t.”In substance and style, there are differences between the two men. The father, forceful and conservative, is close with the commentator Glenn Beck (yet is a sometime donor to Democrats). The son, soft-spoken, is often at odds with his party. In 2008, they split on presidential politics: the father backed Mr. Romney; the son, Senator John McCain.

Still, Mr. Huntsman has faced questions about whether he is his own man — so much so that when he first ran for governor, his campaign aides joked about making silver spoon lapel pins.

“I don’t think there’s much question that he would not have been ambassador to Singapore without his father’s strong support, and his father had a very good Rolodex in those days,” said Robert F. Bennett, a Republican former senator from Utah and Romney supporter, “but all reports are he did a very good job.”Others are less charitable. “Look at where he’s been, look what he’s done,” said Bob Springmeyer, a Salt Lake businessman and Democrat who lost to Mr. Huntsman in 2008. “If you had dropped out of high school, could you have gotten into Penn? Do you think you’d be named trade ambassador without major campaign contributions?” Keeping a Strategic DistanceIn the late 1990s, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which oversaw the 2002 Winter Olympics, became engulfed in scandal and needed a new chief.According to several people familiar with the selection process, Mr. Huntsman’s father reached out to committee and state officials to lobby for his son. “He was pretty bent out of shape” when Mr. Romney was picked, recalled Mr. Wilson, the former Salt Lake City mayor.Mr. Huntsman said that he was “not aware of any reaching out” by his father and that he did not seek the job because Mr. Romney’s selection seemed a foregone conclusion. Today, Mr. Romney’s success in revamping the troubled games is one reason he is outpolling Mr. Huntsman here, two to one.When Mr. Huntsman sought the governorship in 2004 — his first bid for elective office — aides insisted he would not buy his way into the job. Huntsman Corporation employees, its political action committee and family members gave $188,634 of the $2.8 million Mr. Huntsman raised that year, making the company his top contributor, according to records compiled by the Sunlight Foundation, an open government group.The elder Huntsman was a frequent presence on the campaign trail — Mr. Bennett called him the “head cheerleader” — but steered clear of strategy sessions. Jeff Hartley, then a Huntsman campaign adviser, said it was a wise decision “to let Jon be his own man.”

After Mr. Huntsman won, his father was “circumspect about being seen at the Capitol,” said Mr. Chambless, the political scientist, though many here viewed him as a behind-the-scenes adviser — a role he appears to be reprising.

In late June, Mr. Huntsman Sr. hosted his son’s top donors at his home in the Utah resort town of Deer Valley. David Fischer, a close Huntsman family friend who has just quit the campaign, told Politico last week that the elder Huntsman expressed concern about internal feuding and disarray.“But there’s a limit to what the father can do,” Mr. Fischer was quoted as saying.Only a week before that meeting, Mr. Huntsman announced his candidacy against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty, with his wife, Mary Kaye, and six of their seven children by his side. Looking on stood another Huntsman: his father. It was a birthday present of sorts; Jon M. Huntsman Sr. turned 74 that day.

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. (born March 26, 1960) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as the 16th Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, and as United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993, and China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[1] In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2] It has been reported he was chosen to be the next Ambassador to Russia in March 2017.[3]
Huntsman has served in every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He also served as CEO of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama.
While Governor, he was named Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States.[4] He won re-election in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and left office with approval ratings over 80%.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California.[6] His mother is Karen (née Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight,[7] and his father is billionaire businessman and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. of the Huntsman Corporation.[8] Through his father, Huntsman Jr. is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.[9]
At age 15 in 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[10] Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City, but dropped out before graduating to pursue his passion as a keyboard player in a rock band called "Wizard".[11][12] Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987.
Political career[edit]
While visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman that he was secretly traveling to China.[13] He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.[14] In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[15]
Ambassador to Singapore[edit]
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990.[14] He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991.[14] In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore,[16] which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.[17] When questioned by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, he said that he had been the chairman of Utah's presidential fundraising committee and had donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign, an amount that Sarbanes described as "not a large amount really".[18] At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.[19]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as President, the Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed U.S. Ambassador to China.[20] In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.[21] On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States Trade Representatives in his administration;[22] he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.[14]
Governor of Utah[edit]
Main articles: Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 and Utah gubernatorial election, 2008
In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah.[26] In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%.[27] In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr.[28] In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.[29]
Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as Governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%.[5][30][31] Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States.[4] Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top 3 state to do business in.[32] The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of "B"; the institute gave him an "A" on tax policy and an "F" on spending policy.[33]
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey, Utah was ranked number one in the nation in job growth during Huntsman's tenure, a rate of 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. However, according to the Bureau's Current Employment Statistics survey, Utah ranked number four in the country in job creation, with 4.8% growth. Utah trailed Texas (6.5%), North Dakota (7.5%), and Wyoming (9.5%).[34]
The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that "tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million." Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.[35]
During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $16.7 to $22.8 billion.[36] Utah saw spending increases higher than inflation and in 2006 he proposed the largest state budget in the state's history.[33]
Huntsman supported Cap and trade policies, and as governor signed the Western Climate Initiative.[37] He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage.[38] He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws.[39] In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act which he said was "the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program is open to all current public school children as well as some children already in private school." The voucher law was repealed in a public referendum.[40]
Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign,[41][42] while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney.[43] Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007.[44] At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.[45]
Ambassador to China[edit]

President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,[46] which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009.[47] On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman[48] and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.[49]
Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.[50]
In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the "Jasmine Revolution".[51][52] On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the Wangfujing shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date. When approached by an onlooker asking why he was there, Huntsman replied, "I'm just here to look around." When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area. Photographs of Huntsman at the scene and a video of the encounter, which further accused Huntsman and the United States of attempting to instigate an anti-government revolution in China, were posted on a Chinese website.[53] The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been "unaware" of the planned protest, and happened to be "strolling through the area on a family outing".[54] Huntsman's Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines.[55]
Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.
2012 presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Jon Huntsman presidential campaign, 2012

Background[edit]
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,[56][57] and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.[58] Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.[59]
Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."[60] On November 12, 2008 Politico called him a possible 2012 contender.[61] Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.[43][62]
Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."[63] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012."[64]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.[65] On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."[66] The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".[67]
A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position. ... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.[68] The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.[69]
Campaign[edit]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time.[70] Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.[71][72][73]
On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC.[74] On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, during an interview with Harold Evans, he said he would announce his campaign for president on June 21.[75][76]
Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.[77][78] After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.[79]
Post-campaign politics[edit]
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show Morning Joe on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process.

I think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.[80]
The Republican National Committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March.[81] In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.

In early November 2012, just days before Barack Obama was re-elected as President, the Associated Press named Huntsman as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State.[82] This speculation was echoed by various media outlets[83] particularly after Huntsman came to the defense of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, describing the criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack as being "overblown."[84]
On November 20, 2012, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was "honest about our concerns about Huntsman" and that Huntsman "would have been a very tough candidate."[85]
In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2]
Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.[86] In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump,[87] but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy [88]
In November 2016, Huntsman "said he’s weighing a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, depending in part on whether fellow Republican Orrin Hatch decides to seek an eighth term."[89]
Possible Trump administration position[edit]
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump Transition team as a possible choice for Secretary of State in 2017.[90] Rex Tillerson was chosen ten days later.
Huntsman defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process.[90] Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.[90]
It was reported on March 8, 2017 that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia.[91]
Political views[edit]
Huntsman has been described by the Huffington Post as "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama"[92] and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.[93]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.[94] In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".[95]
According to Haley Barbour, former Governor of Mississippi:

Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state—elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.[96]

Fiscal policy[edit]




Huntsman speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, in 2009


In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.[97] However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."[97] He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".[98]
As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with." The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."[99]
In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.[100]

Social issues[edit]
As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.[101] Huntsman actively supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah,[102] but not same-sex marriage.[103]
In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman expressed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience."[104][105]
In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[106]
Environment and energy[edit]
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases.[107] He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."[107] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment."[108]
Later that year, in response to perceived anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, he tweeted: "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." [109] Soon after, however, he clarified this position by stating: "There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue. We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."[110]
Foreign policy[edit]




Huntsman meets with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in June 2016


Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."[111] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.[112]
Immigration[edit]
In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.[113] In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to "driving-privilege cards", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes.[114] As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.[115]
Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, "as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice."[116] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence.[117] Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.[118]
Huntsman supported the DREAM Act which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.[119]
Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property[edit]
Huntsman is the co-head, along with Dennis C. Blair, of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.[120]
Business career[edit]
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company. Other organizations he has served include the Utah Opera, Envision Utah, the Coalition for Utah's Future, and KSL-TV's Family Now campaign.
In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.[121]
Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford's Executive Chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman's global knowledge and experience – especially in Asia – as well as his tenure as the Governor of Utah.[122] Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.[123]
On March 23, 2012, the Washington Post reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the issue of the vacant presidency of the World Bank. According to the Post, a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.[124]
Personal life[edit]




Huntsman with his wife Mary Kaye in May 2014


Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, Mary Kaye, have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth ("Liddy"; b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India).[125]
Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary Parley Pratt, is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.[126][127][128] Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and that Romney's selection was "precooked".[129] As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to New York Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. New York wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."[129] Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.[129]
He is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard.[130] He has cited Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep as his favorite bands during college. On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by progressive metal band Dream Theater. Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating "Dream Theater Day" on that date for the state of Utah.[131] He also is a fan of avant-garde musician Captain Beefheart, citing Trout Mask Replica (1969) as his favorite album by Beefheart.[132] Huntsman also joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah.[133]
Huntsman has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees,[134] including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from Snow College in 2005,[135] an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Westminster College in 2008,[136] an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Utah in 2010,[137] an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010,[138] and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011.[139] He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.[140]
In 2007 he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA.[141] He is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution Asia Policy Board, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Religious views[edit]
Huntsman was brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, "I believe in God. I'm a good Christian. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."[142]
However, he told Newsweek in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.[143] In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".[144][145] Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating: "Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." [146]
Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that global warming was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman tweeted, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."[147] He said, "The minute that the Republican Party becomes... the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."[148]

Jon M. Huntsman, Jr.
Member, Board of Directors, Ford Motor Company
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. was elected to the Ford Motor Company board of directors in 2012. He serves on the compensation committee, nominating and governance committee and sustainability and innovation committee.

Huntsman was appointed chairman of Huntsman Cancer Foundation in 2012. He serves as chairman of the Atlantic Council of the United States and as a director of Huntsman Corporation, Caterpillar and Chevron.

He was tapped by President Barack Obama to serve as United States Ambassador to China and was sworn in immediately following his resignation as governor of Utah in 2009. As a dedicated public servant, Huntsman was committed to supporting the United States in one of its most critical international relationships.

Huntsman was twice elected governor of Utah, including in 2008 capturing a record percent of the vote and with the majority in all 29 counties. He governed with an eye toward maintaining Utah’s unparalleled quality of life, continually increasing the state’s economic competitiveness and maximizing funding to its public education system.

Huntsman’s breadth of experience in Asia has been developed over a lifetime of interest and involvement. He has lived in Asia four times and speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese.

Huntsman’s public service career began as a White House staff assistant to President Ronald Reagan and has since included appointments as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Asia and U.S. Ambassador to Singapore. As a trade ambassador, he negotiated dozens of free trade agreements, trade and investment framework agreements, and brokered bilateral and multilateral trade agreements for the United States with China, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, India, Vietnam, West Africa, South Africa and other Asian and African nations. He played a critical role in launching global trade negotiations in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, guiding the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization.

He is a founding director of Pacific Council on International Policy, and serves as a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institute, a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a trustee of the Reagan Presidential Foundation.

In Huntsman’s tenure as governor, Utah was repeatedly recognized by prestigious organizations for its dynamism, business climate and quality of life. Perhaps most importantly, it was named by Pew Center as the best managed state in America. In times of economic hardship, Huntsman worked with stakeholders to minimize impacts to critical human services while maintaining job-stimulating construction projects and keeping the state’s rainy day fund intact.

Recognized nationally for his leadership, Huntsman served as chairman of the Western Governors’ Association and on the executive committee of the National Governors Association.

Huntsman is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and has six honorary doctorates.

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

He has served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[1] In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2] It has been reported he was chosen to be the next Ambassador to Russia in March 2017.[3]
Huntsman has served in every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization.

While Governor, he was named Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States.[4] He won re-election in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and left office with approval ratings over 80%.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California.[6] His mother is Karen (née Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight,[7] and his father is billionaire businessman and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. of the Huntsman Corporation.[8] Through his father, Huntsman Jr. is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.[9]
At age 15 in 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[10] Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City, but dropped out before graduating to pursue his passion as a keyboard player in a rock band called "Wizard".[11][12] Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987.
Political career[edit]
While visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman that he was secretly traveling to China.[13] He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.[14] In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[15]
Ambassador to Singapore[edit]
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990.[14] He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991.[14] In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore,[16] which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.[17] When questioned by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, he said that he had been the chairman of Utah's presidential fundraising committee and had donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign, an amount that Sarbanes described as "not a large amount really".[18] At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.[19]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as President, the Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed U.S. Ambassador to China.[20] In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.[21] On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States Trade Representatives in his administration;[22] he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.[14]
Governor of Utah[edit]
Main articles: Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 and Utah gubernatorial election, 2008
In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah.[26] In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%.[27] In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr.[28] In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.[29]
Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as Governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%.[5][30][31] Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States.[4] Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top 3 state to do business in.[32] The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of "B"; the institute gave him an "A" on tax policy and an "F" on spending policy.[33]
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey, Utah was ranked number one in the nation in job growth during Huntsman's tenure, a rate of 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. However, according to the Bureau's Current Employment Statistics survey, Utah ranked number four in the country in job creation, with 4.8% growth. Utah trailed Texas (6.5%), North Dakota (7.5%), and Wyoming (9.5%).[34]
The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that "tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million." Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.[35]
During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $16.7 to $22.8 billion.[36] Utah saw spending increases higher than inflation and in 2006 he proposed the largest state budget in the state's history.[33]
Huntsman supported Cap and trade policies, and as governor signed the Western Climate Initiative.[37] He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage.[38] He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws.[39] In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act which he said was "the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program is open to all current public school children as well as some children already in private school." The voucher law was repealed in a public referendum.[40]
Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign,[41][42] while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney.[43] Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007.[44] At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.[45]
Ambassador to China[edit]

President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,[46] which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009.[47] On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman[48] and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.[49]
Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.[50]
In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the "Jasmine Revolution".[51][52] On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the Wangfujing shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date. When approached by an onlooker asking why he was there, Huntsman replied, "I'm just here to look around." When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area. Photographs of Huntsman at the scene and a video of the encounter, which further accused Huntsman and the United States of attempting to instigate an anti-government revolution in China, were posted on a Chinese website.[53] The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been "unaware" of the planned protest, and happened to be "strolling through the area on a family outing".[54] Huntsman's Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines.[55]
Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.
2012 presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Jon Huntsman presidential campaign, 2012

Background[edit]
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,[56][57] and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.[58] Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.[59]
Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."[60] On November 12, 2008 Politico called him a possible 2012 contender.[61] Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.[43][62]
Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."[63] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012."[64]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.[65] On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."[66] The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".[67]
A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position. ... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.[68] The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.[69]
Campaign[edit]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time.[70] Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.[71][72][73]
On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC.[74] On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, during an interview with Harold Evans, he said he would announce his campaign for president on June 21.[75][76]
Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.[77][78] After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.[79]
Post-campaign politics[edit]
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show Morning Joe on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process.

I think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.[80]
The Republican National Committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March.[81] In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.

In early November 2012, just days before Barack Obama was re-elected as President, the Associated Press named Huntsman as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State.[82] This speculation was echoed by various media outlets[83] particularly after Huntsman came to the defense of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, describing the criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack as being "overblown."[84]
On November 20, 2012, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was "honest about our concerns about Huntsman" and that Huntsman "would have been a very tough candidate."[85]
In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2]
Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.[86] In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump,[87] but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy [88]
In November 2016, Huntsman "said he’s weighing a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, depending in part on whether fellow Republican Orrin Hatch decides to seek an eighth term."[89]
Possible Trump administration position[edit]
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump Transition team as a possible choice for Secretary of State in 2017.[90] Rex Tillerson was chosen ten days later.
Huntsman defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process.[90] Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.[90]
It was reported on March 8, 2017 that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia.[91]
Political views[edit]
Huntsman has been described by the Huffington Post as "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama"[92] and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.[93]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.[94] In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".[95]
According to Haley Barbour, former Governor of Mississippi:

Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state—elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.[96]

Fiscal policy[edit]

In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.[97] However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."[97] He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".[98]
As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with." The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."[99]
In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.[100]

Social issues[edit]
As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.[101] Huntsman actively supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah,[102] but not same-sex marriage.[103]
In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman expressed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience."[104][105]
In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[106]
Environment and energy[edit]
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases.[107] He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."[107] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment."[108]
Later that year, in response to perceived anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, he tweeted: "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." [109] Soon after, however, he clarified this position by stating: "There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue. We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."[110]
Foreign policy[edit]

Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."[111] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.[112]
Immigration[edit]
In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.[113] In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to "driving-privilege cards", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes.[114] As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.[115]
Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, "as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice."[116] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence.[117] Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.[118]
Huntsman supported the DREAM Act which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.[119]
Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property[edit]
Huntsman is the co-head, along with Dennis C. Blair, of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.[120]
Business career[edit]
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company. Other organizations he has served include the Utah Opera, Envision Utah, the Coalition for Utah's Future, and KSL-TV's Family Now campaign.
In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.[121]
Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford's Executive Chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman's global knowledge and experience – especially in Asia – as well as his tenure as the Governor of Utah.[122] Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.[123]
On March 23, 2012, the Washington Post reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the issue of the vacant presidency of the World Bank. According to the Post, a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.[124]
Personal life[edit]




Huntsman with his wife Mary Kaye in May 2014


Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, Mary Kaye, have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth ("Liddy"; b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India).[125]
Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary Parley Pratt, is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.[126][127][128] Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and that Romney's selection was "precooked".[129] As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to New York Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. New York wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."[129] Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.[129]
He is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard.[130] He has cited Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep as his favorite bands during college. On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by progressive metal band Dream Theater. Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating "Dream Theater Day" on that date for the state of Utah.[131] He also is a fan of avant-garde musician Captain Beefheart, citing Trout Mask Replica (1969) as his favorite album by Beefheart.[132] Huntsman also joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah.[133]
Huntsman has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees,[134] including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from Snow College in 2005,[135] an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Westminster College in 2008,[136] an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Utah in 2010,[137] an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010,[138] and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011.[139] He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.[140]
In 2007 he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA.[141] He is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution Asia Policy Board, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Religious views[edit]
Huntsman was brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, "I believe in God. I'm a good Christian. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."[142]
However, he told Newsweek in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.[143] In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".[144][145] Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating: "Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." [146]
Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that global warming was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman tweeted, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."[147] He said, "The minute that the Republican Party becomes... the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."[148]

Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. (born March 26, 1960) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as the 16th Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, and as United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993, and China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[1] In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2] It has been reported he was chosen to be the next Ambassador to Russia in March 2017.[3]
Huntsman has served in every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He also served as CEO of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama.
While Governor, he was named Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States.[4] He won re-election in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and left office with approval ratings over 80%.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960 in Redwood City, California.[6] His mother is Karen (née Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight,[7] and his father is billionaire businessman and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. of the Huntsman Corporation.[8] Through his father, Huntsman Jr. is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.[9]
At age 15 in 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[10] Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City, but dropped out before graduating to pursue his passion as a keyboard player in a rock band called "Wizard".[11][12] Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987.
Political career[edit]
While visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman that he was secretly traveling to China.[13] He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.[14] In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[15]
Ambassador to Singapore[edit]
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990.[14] He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991.[14] In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore,[16] which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.[17] When questioned by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, he said that he had been the chairman of Utah's presidential fundraising committee and had donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign, an amount that Sarbanes described as "not a large amount really".[18] At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.[19]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as President, the Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed U.S. Ambassador to China.[20] In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.[21] On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States Trade Representatives in his administration;[22] he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.[14]
Governor of Utah[edit]
Main articles: Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 and Utah gubernatorial election, 2008
In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration.[23][24][25] Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah.[26] In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%.[27] In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr.[28] In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.[29]
Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as Governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%.[5][30][31] Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States.[4] Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top 3 state to do business in.[32] The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of "B"; the institute gave him an "A" on tax policy and an "F" on spending policy.[33]
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey, Utah was ranked number one in the nation in job growth during Huntsman's tenure, a rate of 5.9% between 2005 and 2009. However, according to the Bureau's Current Employment Statistics survey, Utah ranked number four in the country in job creation, with 4.8% growth. Utah trailed Texas (6.5%), North Dakota (7.5%), and Wyoming (9.5%).[34]
The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that "tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million." Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.[35]
During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $16.7 to $22.8 billion.[36] Utah saw spending increases higher than inflation and in 2006 he proposed the largest state budget in the state's history.[33]
Huntsman supported Cap and trade policies, and as governor signed the Western Climate Initiative.[37] He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage.[38] He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws.[39] In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act which he said was "the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program is open to all current public school children as well as some children already in private school." The voucher law was repealed in a public referendum.[40]
Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign,[41][42] while most Utah and Mormon politicians supported Mitt Romney.[43] Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and went with him to Iraq over Thanksgiving in 2007.[44] At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for Vice President.[45]
Ambassador to China[edit]

President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,[46] which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009.[47] On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman[48] and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.[49]
Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009 to begin his assignment and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.[50]
In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the "Jasmine Revolution".[51][52] On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the Wangfujing shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date. When approached by an onlooker asking why he was there, Huntsman replied, "I'm just here to look around." When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area. Photographs of Huntsman at the scene and a video of the encounter, which further accused Huntsman and the United States of attempting to instigate an anti-government revolution in China, were posted on a Chinese website.[53] The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been "unaware" of the planned protest, and happened to be "strolling through the area on a family outing".[54] Huntsman's Chinese name, 洪博培 (Hóng Bópéi), was temporarily blocked from Chinese search engines.[55]
Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.
2012 presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Jon Huntsman presidential campaign, 2012

Background[edit]
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,[56][57] and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.[58] Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.[59]
Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."[60] On November 12, 2008 Politico called him a possible 2012 contender.[61] Washington Post blogger Chris Cillizza also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.[43][62]
Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."[63] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012."[64]
In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.[65] On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."[66] The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".[67]
A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position. ... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.[68] The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.[69]
Campaign[edit]
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time.[70] Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.[71][72][73]
On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC.[74] On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, FL. On June 14, during an interview with Harold Evans, he said he would announce his campaign for president on June 21.[75][76]
Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.[77][78] After focusing his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary in which he finished third, Huntsman announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012, endorsing Mitt Romney.[79]
Post-campaign politics[edit]
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a third party in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show Morning Joe on February 23, 2012, Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the presidential election process.

I think we’re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.[80]
The Republican National Committee reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear as a speaker at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March.[81] In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.

In early November 2012, just days before Barack Obama was re-elected as President, the Associated Press named Huntsman as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State.[82] This speculation was echoed by various media outlets[83] particularly after Huntsman came to the defense of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, describing the criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack as being "overblown."[84]
On November 20, 2012, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was "honest about our concerns about Huntsman" and that Huntsman "would have been a very tough candidate."[85]
In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council.[2]
Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.[86] In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump,[87] but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy [88]
In November 2016, Huntsman "said he’s weighing a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, depending in part on whether fellow Republican Orrin Hatch decides to seek an eighth term."[89]
Possible Trump administration position[edit]
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump Transition team as a possible choice for Secretary of State in 2017.[90] Rex Tillerson was chosen ten days later.
Huntsman defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process.[90] Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.[90]
It was reported on March 8, 2017 that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia.[91]
Political views[edit]
Huntsman has been described by the Huffington Post as "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama"[92] and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.[93]
As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.[94] In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".[95]
According to Haley Barbour, former Governor of Mississippi:

Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state—elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.[96]

Fiscal policy[edit]




Huntsman speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, in 2009


In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.[97] However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."[97] He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".[98]
As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with." The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."[99]
In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits. He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.[100]

Social issues[edit]
As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.[101] Huntsman actively supported legislation that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah,[102] but not same-sex marriage.[103]
In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman expressed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience."[104][105]
In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[106]
Environment and energy[edit]
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases.[107] He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."[107] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until it comes back, this isn't the moment."[108]
Later that year, in response to perceived anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, he tweeted: "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." [109] Soon after, however, he clarified this position by stating: "There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue. We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."[110]
Foreign policy[edit]




Huntsman meets with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in June 2016


Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."[111] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.[112]
Immigration[edit]
In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.[113] In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to "driving-privilege cards", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes.[114] As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.[115]
Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, "as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice."[116] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence.[117] Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.[118]
Huntsman supported the DREAM Act which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.[119]
Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property[edit]
Huntsman is the co-head, along with Dennis C. Blair, of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.[120]
Business career[edit]
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company. Other organizations he has served include the Utah Opera, Envision Utah, the Coalition for Utah's Future, and KSL-TV's Family Now campaign.
In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.[121]
Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford's Executive Chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman's global knowledge and experience – especially in Asia – as well as his tenure as the Governor of Utah.[122] Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.[123]
On March 23, 2012, the Washington Post reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the issue of the vacant presidency of the World Bank. According to the Post, a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.[124]
Personal life[edit]




Huntsman with his wife Mary Kaye in May 2014


Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, Mary Kaye, have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth ("Liddy"; b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India).[125]
Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary Parley Pratt, is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.[126][127][128] Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and that Romney's selection was "precooked".[129] As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to New York Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. New York wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."[129] Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.[129]
He is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard.[130] He has cited Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep as his favorite bands during college. On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by progressive metal band Dream Theater. Later that day, Huntsman signed a proclamation creating "Dream Theater Day" on that date for the state of Utah.[131] He also is a fan of avant-garde musician Captain Beefheart, citing Trout Mask Replica (1969) as his favorite album by Beefheart.[132] Huntsman also joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair on September 16, 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing outdoor sporting activities and outdoor tourism for the State of Utah.[133]
Huntsman has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees,[134] including an Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from Snow College in 2005,[135] an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Westminster College in 2008,[136] an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Utah in 2010,[137] an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010,[138] and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011.[139] He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.[140]
In 2007 he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA.[141] He is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution Asia Policy Board, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Religious views[edit]
Huntsman was brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, "I believe in God. I'm a good Christian. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."[142]
However, he told Newsweek in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.[143] In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".[144][145] Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating: "Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." [146]
Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that global warming was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman tweeted, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."[147] He said, "The minute that the Republican Party becomes... the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."[148]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]

Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Full Bio
Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. is chairman of the Atlantic Council and co-chairman of No Labels. He began his career in public service as a staff assistant to President Ronald Reagan. He has served each of the four US presidents since then in critical roles around the world, including as ambassador to Singapore, deputy assistant secretary of commerce for Asia, US trade ambassador, and most recently, US ambassador to China. In all three Senate confirmations, he received unanimous votes. Twice elected governor of Utah, Huntsman brought about strong economic reforms, tripled the state’s rainy day fund, and helped bring unemployment rates to historic lows. During his tenure, Utah was named the best managed state in America. Recognized by others for his service, Governor Huntsman was elected as chairman of the Western Governors Association, serving nineteen states throughout the region. This was a far better result than in his run for the Presidency in 2012 where he ultimately placed third in the New Hampshire primary before bowing out. He currently serves on the boards of Ford Motor Company, Caterpillar Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Hilton Worldwide, the US Naval Academy Foundation, and the University of Pennsylvania. In addition, he serves as a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institute, a trustee of the Reagan Presidential Foundation, and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. Governor Huntsman has served as a visiting fellow at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government as well as a distinguished lecturer at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy. He was recently inducted into the American Academy of Diplomacy. Huntsman is the father of seven children, including two adopted daughters from China and India. His two sons, both graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy, are active duty naval officers - the oldest of whom is currently training as a fighter pilot. Huntsman is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and has nine honorary doctoral degrees.
