 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      JMP Group Inc. (NYSE:JMP), an investment banking and alternative asset

      management firm, announced today that its board of directors has elected

      David M. DiPietro as a new independent director. Mr. DiPietro's initial

      term as a director will end as of the company's annual meeting of

      shareholders in 2011, when he will stand for election to a full one-year

      term. Mr. DiPietro's election increases the company's total number of

      board members to nine and brings the number of independent directors to

      five.

    


      "We are pleased to welcome David as a member of our board," said Joseph

      A. Jolson, JMP Group's chairman and chief executive officer. "David has

      will be invaluable as we continue to expand JMP Securities and shape the

      growth strategy for JMP Group."

    


      Mr. DiPietro was formerly president of Signal Hill Capital Group LLC, a

      boutique investment bank headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, where he

      initiated and oversaw the firm's institutional equities business as well

      as its venture capital and private equity coverage initiatives. From

      1999 through 2003, Mr. DiPietro was vice chairman of the board of

      directors of Deutsche Bank Securities and a member of the firm's global

      operating committees for equities and private wealth management, at

      first serving as head of North American equities and later as head of

      the private client division. From 1992 through 1999, he managed the

      equity capital markets division at Bankers Trust Company, which was

      acquired by Deutsche Bank in 1999, and at Alex. Brown Incorporated,

      which was acquired by Bankers Trust in 1997. Mr. DiPietro previously

      held an equity capital markets role at Merrill Lynch and a research

      position at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
