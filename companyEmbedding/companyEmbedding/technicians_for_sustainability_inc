How It Works — Technicians For Sustainability






















































How It Works

From your rooftop to your outlets, explained














1. Solar Panels: Powering your home with the sun starts here! Typically mounted onto your roof, solar panels are made up of photovoltaic (or PV) cells, which convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. Solar panels can also be integrated into other structures such as carports, ramadas, fixed ground mounts, and trackers.2. Inverter: Solar panels create DC electricity, which the inverter then converts to AC electricity, which is used in homes.3. Solar Meter: The solar meter measures how much electricity your PV system produces.4. AC Disconnect: This enables electricians to disconnect the building’s electrical system from the solar electricity system. By switching the AC disconnect off, workers can safely perform system maintenance.5. Electric Panel: AC electricity from your inverter is passed onto the electric service panel where it is routed to power your home’s various electric loads.6. NET Meter: Through a process called NET Metering, when your solar system produces more power than you use, a NET meter (provided by the utility company) records the amount of electricity being sent back to the grid (for which you receive credit) and how much electricity you are receiving from the utility. As you use more electricity, you will first use up any credits that you have before paying for additional electricity.






A closer look.



7. Utility Grid: Grid-tied solar photovoltaic systems interface seamlessly with the utility grid, which allows the utility to serve as the back-up power for your building, rather than storing excess electricity in batteries. During the day, your PV system will first power any electric loads in your building, before sending any excess generation back to the utility grid. At night you’ll draw from the utility grid, essentially using the electrical grid as a giant storage battery.PERFORMANCE







Performance monitoring allows both you and TFS to monitor your solar electric (PV) system remotely via the Internet. TFS regularly assesses your system’s electricity production to be certain that your system is continuously operating at peak performance.With performance monitoring, you can see exactly how much electricity your system is producing, and track your environmental benefits and financial savings since the solar system installation. In real time, monitoring records, stores, and presents your system’s daily, monthly, and annual performance using easy-to-understand diagrams and graphs.Offered with SunPower Data Monitoring, Consumption Monitoring clearly shows your household’s electrical consumption, side by side with your system’s electricity production.  This can be used as a tool to monitor and potentially reduce your electrical usage.How does Performance Monitoring Benefit You?Assure Optimal Performance - Monitoring your system enables us to quickly assess if your system is down or under-performing due to solar panel shading, excessive accumulation of dust, or a possible component glitch.Monitor Solar Savings – Easily understand the financial benefits of your solar electric system by tracking how much you have saved over the lifetime of your system. Leverage your savings by assessing your household’s energy use and optimizing net metering.Quantify Environmental Impact – Using clear dynamic graphs and charts, performance makes it easy for you, your family, and friends to understand the environmental benefits of your system.Measure History & Trends – Easily view long-term trends in energy production and usage patterns under various times of day and year. You can even compare daily, monthly, or annual information.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Technicians for Sustainability — Local First Arizona

Technicians for Sustainability



Local First


March 31, 2015



Sustainability, Tucson & Southern Arizona




For many, the concept of sustainability places most of its focus on the environment. In actuality, it encompasses much more than being good to the planet, from social equity to economic sustainability to creating a product or service that benefits the community. Technicians for Sustainability is a Tucson solar installation company that engages in many different facets of sustainability, which I found out with a visit to their workplace.
I was excited to venture out of Phoenix and conduct my first interview with a locally owned business. As I approached Technicians for Sustainability's office, I noticed a lack of vehicles at a place where there was at least 7-10 employees inside. Their building feels more like a home than an office where the company’s employees buzzed with greetings and productive conversation. In the back of the house the installers were hard at work collecting their tools and items for the day’s work,  popping in and out to greet those in the office. It was obvious to me that this was a place that people liked to be, from the employees to the owners to the installers.
Technicians for Sustainability’s mission is multi-faceted. As a for profit business, they sell and install high-quality, clean, solar electric and solar hot water systems that are built to last. They have an intriguing sales model, as they do not try to sell their product but instead take much more value in educating potential customers and youth about the benefits of solar energy. One of their programs has their employees travel to local schools, from preschool to college, to engage students in hands-on projects displaying how solar power can positively impact daily life in all aspects from environmental improvements to economic improvements.
The education process doesn’t stop at educating students though. TFS’ owners Nicole and Kevin Koch pursue an education for their staff as well. While they see value in staff bonding events, they want to give more to their staff than awards and fun. They practice open-book management, meaning any of their employees are welcome to learn more about the financials of the business. This not only provides transparency between owners and employees, but teaches the employees financial literacy.
They also focus on creating a vibrant corporate culture with their employees in the fore front. Their hiring process is primarily grassroots, as they hire on recommendation and are drawn to people who have an interest in social sustainability. TFS encourages alternative transportation among their staff by encouraging their team to commute via bicycle. I heard a plethora of biking stories including a staff member who lost a significant amount of weight and an employee who sold her car and began riding her bike 5-7 miles a day, not due to pressure but due to an adoption of culture that exists within the company.
TFS also practices environmental sustainability in the traditional sense. When working on an installation, they use modified electric bikes to get solar panels to work sites throughout the city. For locations that are too far for electric bike, they use electric cars and hybrids, along with  fuel efficient trucks for more arduous trips. They recycle glass, paper, plastics and a large number of wooden pallets used for solar panel shipping. The pallets get reused by a local furniture store that transforms them into home furnishings.
As I left Tucson, I pondered the choice of Technicians for Sustainability as the company’s name. Certainly they could incorporate the word “solar” or “alternative energies” in there somewhere. After sitting down with this incredible group, I understand why. Solar power installation is a service and a product, yet this company is at the helm of something much greater. They exude sustainability in all they do, from education to company transparency to being a certified B Corporation to coming up with outside-the-box methods to provide a fun and eco-minded culture. Technicians for Sustainability is a fantastic example of what can be done by incorporating sustainability into your business on a variety of levels.

About Technicians For Sustainability
Technicians For Sustainability (TFS) is a locally-owned, mission-driven business dedicated to helping customers translate their environmental values into a practical reality. Based in Tucson, Arizona, TFS installs high-quality, clean, solar electric and hot water systems built to last. Since opening in 2003, TFS has installed over 15 megawatts of solar for both residential and commercial customers.
At TFS, we believe that corporations and businesses are not only instruments of social change but have a responsibility to support our communities and the natural environment. We are proud to be part of the B Corp movement and support the belief that corporations exist to sustain thriving communities.

The Change We Seek®
The goal at Technicians For Sustainability is to ensure that Southern Arizona's natural resources are used efficiently and with respect for present and future needs. With that in mind, TFS is committed to enhancing their community through making high-quality solar accessible to everyone.
In everything they do as a company and as individuals, the team at TFS strives to walk their talk. This means tackling things like lower impact transportation, enhancing employee health, clean energy use, purchasing with integrity, and giving to the community through outreach, education, and donation programs.
Most staff have biked to work for the last ten years, and the company has a fleet that includes customized bicycles and trailers, hybrid and all electric vehicles, and the most fuel efficient trucks available for the job. At their downtown Tucson office, TFS utilizes a solar assisted hydronic heating system, and generates electricity with a 5.2 kW solar energy system. Priority is placed on local, and socially and environmentally responsible products and vendors, from paper products to work uniforms to web designers.
As part of their connection to the local community, TFS works with local schools and community organizations to implement education programs, provides internships to youth, sponsors several non-profit groups, and offers a variety of giving programs for nonprofits. Additionally, through a Solar Grant Program TFS has provided seven local non-profits with solar energy systems, allowing them to reduce their bill payments and redirect those funds toward supporting their own missions.
