McKenna


PAPER PRODUCTS  POLITICS  CORPORATE AND CIVIC CONNECTIONS  MORTON GROVE
Andrew J. McKenna Sr., 75, chairman, Schwarz Paper Co.Andrew J. McKenna Jr., 48, president, Schwarz Paper Co. (son)
Andrew J. McKenna Jr. proved the apple does not fall far from the tree when he flopped last year as a political candidate, finishing a distant fourth among U.S. Senate hopefuls in the GOP primary.
"In politics you sometimes have to show your mean streak, and Andy didn't want to go that route," says Anthony J. Peraica, a Republican Cook County Board commissioner.
Andrew J. McKenna Sr. has thrived for decades as an elfin, behind-the-scenes diplomat for corporate Chicago, never uttering a negative word about boardroom intrigue he's factored in at McDonald's Corp., Aon Corp., Tribune Co. and three of the city's professional sports teams.
His son is playing more to the family forte in his latest political incarnation: chairman of the Illinois Republican Party. If he's learned anything on his father's knee, it's how to discreetly leverage elite connections.
"He's as good as I've seen in terms of time management," says Mr. McKenna Jr., who has spent virtually his entire career at family-owned Schwarz Paper, rising to president and chief operating officer in 1996.

"What is the key to success? Just be easy to do business with," the younger Mr. McKenna says, quoting a line his father attributes to Schwarz founder S. L. Schwarz.
During his Senate campaign, Mr. McKenna Jr. took a leave from the Morton Grove printer. In the interim, Mr. McKenna Sr. had given up the CEO role, which went to another Schwarz exec, Christopher J. Donnelly.
Mr. McKenna Jr. has yet to prove whether he can bridge the ideological divide that's contributed to his party's eclipsed statewide status. The state GOP this year raised $1.26 million through July. While not impressive relative to Democratic tallies, the GOP figure was twice the comparable-period receipts in the previous year (2001) that followed a presidential election.
"His ability to articulate a message . . . has improved dramatically since he began as a candidate," says former state Sen. Patrick J. O'Malley, R-Palos Park, who ran for governor in 2002.
Mr. McKenna Jr. will be in his element this week, chairing a fund-raiser for Mr. Peraica at that home away from home for GOP moguls, the Chicago Club. "He is running the state GOP as it should be run  as a business," says Mr. Peraica.

Financial recourse when hiring Mc Kenna, Andrew J



Licensed contractors in Wisconsin are required to obtain a surety bond.In the event of losses or damages incurred during a construction project,a homeowner can file a claim against a contractors bond.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wisconsin, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
