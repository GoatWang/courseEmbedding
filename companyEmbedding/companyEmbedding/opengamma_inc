The heart of the derivatives market
OpenGamma is the financial technology company at the heart of the derivatives market, delivering unique analytics that marry buy-side needs with sell-side constraints.




TRANSPARENCY THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE 
We provide the data and analytics you need to fully understand and optimise your derivative counterparty relationships. 



THE COMPLETE PICTURE
New regulatory capital constraints are redefining provider and user relationships. We help buy and sell-side participants appreciate how this impacts pricing, working to build longer, more sustainable relationships.


THE OPENGAMMA DIFFERENCE
Our independent services provide an objective view of the all-in costs for derivatives users, helping the sell-side minimise their balance sheet usage and providing the buy-side with the information they need to make smarter counterparty decisions.








Understand
Explore the pricing, execution and clearing models that underpin the commercial relationships between market participants. 


View wallet allocation and cost of trading
Understand the ROA profile of your book 
You can also drill into your internal processes to improve efficiency





Compare
Line up the major clearing brokers and execution providers to compare the service you receive.


See how different commercial terms affect your spend
See strategy level margin and capital usage breakdown
Analyse the full cost of different asset classes e.g. cleared vs uncleared (TCA)





Optimise
Optimise your approach by using hard data to direct your business between counterparties. 


Allocate your book between counterparties to optimise your spend
Simulate different products / counterparties based on the estimated cost of trading





 

Why now?
It’s a new world order - and that requires a fresh approach. With the pressure on banks’ business lines, relationships and pricing, it’s vital for all participants to possess the knowledge to make the sharpest possible decisions. That’s also why it’s never been more important to engage directly with counterparties. After all, in a complex regulatory environment, dialogue and knowledge go hand-in-hand to ensure that all sides of the trade benefit from a fair outcome.

OpenGamma Inc. completed a Series B round of equity financing. Terms were not disclosed.  FirstMark Capital of New York led the round. Accel Partners joined the round as a return investor. OpenGamma of London plans to use the capital to open an office in New York. OpenGamma provides an open source analytics and risk management platform for the financial services industry.
PRESS RELEASE:
OpenGamma Inc., a technology company that provides an open source analytics and risk management platform for the financial services industry, today announced that it has completed a Series B round of equity financing led by FirstMark Capital, a New York City-based venture capital firm investing in early stage technology and technology-enabled businesses. Accel Partners joins the round as a return investor. 
“With its technical expertise and established reputation with London-based institutions, OpenGamma can tap into the more than half a million financial services professionals here in New York and leverage the City’s thriving financial technology entrepreneurial community, charting a course for unprecedented growth.”
The funding will be used by OpenGamma to add to the company’s sales, marketing and commercial operations teams; establish strategic alliances within global markets; continue to build a dynamic open-source community; and strengthen research and development efforts in anticipation of the general availability of the OpenGamma Platform in early 2011. Critical to these efforts will be the opening of a New York City office to leverage the City’s deep fin-tech talent pool and proximity to the world’s leading financial institutions headquartered in the New York metropolitan area.  





“The global economic crisis was in part a result of the financial system’s inability to manage real-time risk across interconnected asset classes and geographic regions. For our global economy to recover the trust and confidence it has lost, it must change the way risk is measured and managed, and OpenGamma provides the only platform that can achieve this critical goal,” said Lawrence D. Lenihan, Founder and Managing Director at FirstMark Capital and newly appointed member of OpenGamma’s Board of Directors. “With its technical expertise and established reputation with London-based institutions, OpenGamma can tap into the more than half a million financial services professionals here in New York and leverage the City’s thriving financial technology entrepreneurial community, charting a course for unprecedented growth.” 
The OpenGamma Platform is a modern, open architecture designed to allow financial services firms to develop the analytic applications their traders and risk managers require. The platform is a unified and customizable solution that supports ad-hoc and pre-trade analysis, live risk and analytics, and batch and overnight risk reporting. By providing an open source alternative to what has historically been homegrown, proprietary software, OpenGamma is set to disrupt and redefine how financial services’ IT departments provision trading and risk technologies. The OpenGamma Platform gives customers the best of both worlds: a vendor supported solution capable of the most taxing of requirements, but with the source code they need at their fingertips.  





“The complexity of the financial markets, stronger corporate governance and more regulatory requirements has IT departments seeking a technically strong and architecturally modern analytical platform that can easily integrate siloed, third-party applications with other major financial components – with the flexibility to fix source code in real-time,” said Kirk Wylie, founder and CEO of OpenGamma. “The OpenGamma Platform is ideally suited to provide solutions for the ongoing challenges faced by financial services firms. We look forward to partnering with FirstMark Capital as we open our second office in one of the world’s leading financial services hubs, and as we begin the next chapter of our growth.” 
Over the last two years, the Bloomberg Administration has launched more than 60 initiatives to support entrepreneurship, including the launch of seven business incubators, encouraging start-up companies to locate and grow in New York City. In addition, the City announced the NYC Entrepreneurial Fund in 2010, a $22 million seed-stage fund with FirstMark Capital, to invest in New York City-based technology startups. 
“New York City provides unparalleled resources for young companies looking to enter the increasingly competitive financial technology marketplace,” said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “Growing companies like OpenGamma recognize that the City’s diverse and talented workforce, access to capital and proximity to industry leaders make having a presence in New York City invaluable towards their future growth. Congratulations to OpenGamma on its expansion.”
