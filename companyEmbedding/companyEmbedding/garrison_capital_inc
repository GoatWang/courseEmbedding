FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

				Garrison Capital Inc. - Initiation Note



Garrison Capital Inc.
BUY (GARS, $14.53)
Good Growth Potential and Asset Quality With Room to Expand - Initiating With A Buy Rating And $17 Price Target.

Investment Conclusion. We are initiating coverage of Garrison Capital Inc. (GARS) with a BUY rating and $17 price target. We think that Garrison has significant potential to deliver a substantial increase in net investment income (NII) per share growth over the next two years. Garrison has a low cost of funds with an effective cost of debt of 3.31% as of 3Q14. The company is a unique BDC with 9.1% of the portfolio in consumer loans and 2.3% in real estate loans. The diversified asset mix has permitted the company to maintain higher effective yields in an increasingly competitive environment in the leveraged loan space. The company is in the process of obtaining a SBIC (Small Business Investment Company) license and we estimate the company will begin to issue SBA (Small Business Administration) debentures in 3Q15. Combined with the additional borrowing capacity that this BDC has available and ability to issue equity in an accretive and opportunistic manner these tailwinds make us confident in our estimates for strong portfolio growth of 22.9% in 2015 and 20.4% in 2016 with anticipated dividend increases in both years. Our $17 price target implies an estimated 2016 P/ NII of 10.3x, dividend yield of 8.2%, and P/NAV of 1.1x compared to the BDC sector averages of 8.9x, 10.7%, and 0.92x, respectively.
Source: S&P Capital IQ, National Securities Corporation Estimates
Garrison will maintain high effective yields and net interest margin (NIM) through asset mix and low cost of funds, in our opinion. Garrison’s NIM has trended up steadily until 3Q14 when it declined slightly by 8 bps. The company’s cost of debt has steadily declined from 4.3% in 1Q13 to 3.3% in 3Q14 with effective yields rising from 7.8% to 11.5% over this same time period. In 3Q14 first lien was 78.8% of the portfolio which is down significantly from 95.2% of the portfolio in 1Q13. The company

Garrison Capital Inc. is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management Investment Company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and we are treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the federal tax code. We are publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "GARS".
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by making investments primarily in debt securities and loans of U.S. based middle-market companies, which we define as those having annual earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, or EBITDA, of between $5 million and $30 million.
Our goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders by assembling a broad portfolio of investments while limiting the downside potential of our investments by:

Investing between $5 million and $25 million per transaction 
Maintaining an emphasis on capital preservation; 
Generally requiring a targeted unlevered annual effective yield of between 10% and 15%, excluding any warrants or other equity interests received by us as part of such investment 
Making investments which afford us a significant capital cushion in the form of junior capital and/or asset coverage as well as adequate lender protections in loan documentation;
Employing a rigorous credit monitoring system for our portfolio, which should enhance the ability of our investment adviser to manage any problems and assist borrowers before operating issues result in financial deterioration; and 
Selecting investments that our investment adviser believes have a low probability of loss.

We are managed by our investment adviser, Garrison Capital Advisers LLC, an affiliate of Garrison Investment Group, and a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 which provides the resources and expertise of the investment professionals at Garrison Investment Group. Garrison Investment Group's investment professionals have substantial experience in identifying and executing financing transactions across a broad range of industries and types of financings and have developed related proprietary sourcing and servicing channels. Our five member investment committee has combined investment experience of more than 152 years and has access to extensive contacts throughout the middle-market which it intends to utilize in order to source and originate loans.
