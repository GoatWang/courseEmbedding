Royce Value Trust, Inc. Completes Distribution Of Shares Of Royce Global Value Trust, Inc. As Part Of Spin-Off Transaction






Business Wire




Oct 21, 2013 4:27 PM EDT













 




























































  Royce Value Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RVT) (“Value Trust”) has completed the distribution of shares of Royce Global Value Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RGT) (“Global Trust”) to its stockholders at the rate of one (1) share of Global Trust common stock for every seven (7) shares of Value Trust common stock owned. Value Trust stockholders also will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Global Trust common stock as part of the spin-off transaction. The fractional shares of Global Trust common stock that otherwise would have been distributed as part of the spin-off transaction were aggregated and sold in the open market. Value Trust stockholders will receive a cash payment equal to their pro rata share of such total sales proceeds. The record date for the spin-off distribution was October 10, 2013, and the payable date (distribution date) was October 17, 2013.  The initial cost basis for the Global Trust shares received as part of the spin-off distribution is $8.975 per share, the fair market value on October 18, 2013, determined by averaging the high and low NYSE trading prices of RGT on that day. The holding period for shares of Global Trust common stock begins on October 18, 2013.  The estimated sources for the spin-off distribution are as follows:                                                                  Estimated Sources for Spin-Off Distribution as of September 30, 2013      Distribution Per Share                Net Investment Income                Net RealizedShort-Term Gains                Net RealizedLong-Term Gains                Return of Capital     $1.4000               $0.0580 (4%)               $0.1424 (10%)               $0.8905 (64%)               $0.3091 (22%)                                            The estimated sources for Value Trust’s distributions for 2013 through September 30, 2013 are as follows:                                                  Estimated Sources for 2013 Distributions Through September 30, 2013     Distribution Per Share           Net Investment Income           Net Realized Short-Term Gains           Net Realized Long-Term Gains           Return of Capital     $1.9800           $0.0821 (4%)           $0.2014 (10%)           $1.2594 (64%)           $0.4371 (22%)                                    You should not draw any conclusions about Value Trust’s investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of Value Trust’s Distribution Policy.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund invests primarily in securities of small-cap and mid-cap companies, which may involve considerably more risk than investing in larger-cap companies. The Fund’s broadly diversified portfolio does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. From time to time, the Fund may invest a significant portion of its net assets in foreign securities, which may involve political, economic, currency and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: All performance information reflects past performance, is presented on a total return basis, net of the Fund's investment advisory fee, and reflects the reinvestment of distributions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. The market price of the Fund's shares will fluctuate, so that shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when sold. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.

Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.
Legg Mason, Inc., its affiliates and its employees are not in the business of providing tax or legal advice to taxpayers. These materials and any tax-related statements are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or relied upon, by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Tax-related statements, if any, may have been written in connection with the "promotion or marketing" of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by these materials, to the extent allowed by applicable law.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.

Important Performance and Expense Information


 All performance information reflects past performance, is presented on a total return basis, and reflects the reinvestment of distributions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Returns as of the most recent month-end may be obtained at www.roycefunds.com. The market price of the Fund's shares will fluctuate, so that shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when sold.
The Fund invests primarily in securities of small-cap and mid-cap companies, which may involve considerably more risk than investing in larger-cap companies. The Fund's broadly diversified portfolio does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. From time to time, the Fund may invest a significant portion of its net assets in foreign securities, which may involve political, economic, currency and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments.

Morningstar Style Mapas of 03/31/17











The Morningstar Style Map is the Morningstar Style Box with the center 75% of fund holdings plotted as the Morningstar Ownership Zone. The Morningstar Style Box is designed to reveal a fund's investment strategy. The Morningstar Ownership Zone provides detail about a portfolio's investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. The Ownership Zone is derived by plotting each stock in the portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the Fund's assets while the plot point in the middle represents the weighted average of its holdings. Over time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.

This material is not authorized for distribution unless preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefuly before investing or sending money.  The Fund is a closed-end registered investment company whose shares of common stock may trade at a discount to their net asset value. Shares of the Fund's common stock are also subject to the market risks of investing in the underlying portfolio securities held by the Fund.Sector weightings are determined using the Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICS"). GICS was developed by, and is the exclusive property of, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P") and MSCI Inc. ("MSCI"). GICS is the trademark of S&P and MSCI. "Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)" and "GICS Direct" are service marks of S&P and MSCI. The Price-Earnings, or P/E, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS). The Fund's P/E ratio calculation excludes companies with zero or negative earnings. The Price-to-Book, or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Standard deviation is a statistical measure within which a fund's total returns have varied over time. The greater the standard deviation, the greater a fund's volatility.
