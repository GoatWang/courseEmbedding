Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

Meyer ’49 and Renee ’53 Luskin
Posted On - May 22, 2015




By Phil Hampton | Photography by Reed Hutchinson


Published Jan. 26, 2011

A Southern California business leader and alumnus, passionate about UCLA’s role as a public resource and agent for social mobility, has donated $100 million to the campus, the second largest gift ever received.
The gift from Meyer Luskin and his wife, Renee, will go toward academic programs and capital improvements that bolster UCLA’s efforts to harness intellectual capital, engage the public and serve as a resource in addressing leading civic and societal challenges, particularly in the Los Angeles region. It will be equally divided between the UCLA School of Public Affairs – the campus home for scholarship and teaching in public policy, urban planning and social welfare – and a planned residential conference center that promises to expand dialogue between scholars, government and business leaders, and the public at large.
Chancellor Gene Block, who has made civic engagement and community service top campus priorities, said the gift “reflects both our strength as a public asset and our optimism for the future.”
“I am humbled and inspired by the extraordinary generosity of Meyer and Renee Luskin,” Block said. “The Luskins are helping to ensure UCLA’s continued leadership as a public university dedicated to developing new knowledge and helping to address both today’s and tomorrow’s most pressing policy and scientific challenges.”
Meyer Luskin commuted to UCLA from Boyle Heights, earning a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1949, and went on to run a diversified company that is now exclusively an animal-feed product manufacturer.
“I live and work in the region and wanted to give back in a creative and unique way that helps UCLA to continue its important work with the broader community,” Luskin said. “In addition to educating students, providing them a way to improve their lives, and conducting research, UCLA should apply faculty expertise to help address our society’s biggest issues, and I am appreciative of being able to contribute to those ends.”
In recognition of the gift, both the school and the residential conference center, which share interconnected goals, will be named after the Luskins. A naming ceremony for the School of Public Affairs is scheduled for March 18.
“The Luskins’ gift allows us to develop a truly contemporary learning environment for the next generation of public leaders and decision-makers, many of whom choose to devote their professional lives to improving Southern California,” said Franklin D. Gilliam Jr., dean of the School of Public Affairs. “The Luskins’ generosity will enable us to expand a regional and national debate on some of the most challenging questions of our time: How do we design modern cities that are livable and sustainable? How do we assimilate immigrants while securing our borders? How do we move toward a more just and equitable society?”
Gilliam said the vast majority of the $50 million flowing to the school will be used to establish endowments to strengthen its academic base, support emerging research areas and attract the best talent to both the faculty and student body. He said priority areas include graduate student fellowships, faculty professorships and new programs in urban studies and social justice – all critical to ensuring continued competitiveness with other leading government and public affairs schools.
Gilliam noted that the school houses the Luskin Center for Innovation, established with support from the Luskins in 2008. The center works closely with elected officials and nonprofit, business and community leaders to develop solutions to important policy challenges.
“The Luskins’ philanthropic priorities are a natural fit with what we do,” Gilliam said.
The other half of the Luskins’ $100 million gift will support a new residential conference facility that will include 33,000 square feet of meeting and conference space, at least 282 guest rooms and a new faculty club. It will be built on the site of the existing faculty center, a 50-year-old structure in need of costly repairs.
The existing faculty center has served the campus well but no longer meets contemporary requirements for conferences and symposia, said Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Scott Waugh.
“Our students and faculty and the community at large deserve a first-class conference facility befitting UCLA’s stature as a top public research university,” Waugh said. “Hosting scholars from around the world and engaging with the community to address leading problems require modern facilities and overnight accommodations for participants.”
Waugh said the conference facility and new faculty club are important tools in attracting and retaining top researchers. No state funding will be involved in construction, tentatively scheduled to begin in the spring of 2012, pending approval by the University of California Board of Regents.
Waugh said a portion of the conference center gift – $10 million – will be set aside in an endowment to fund conferences that otherwise may have difficulty securing funding. For example, academic departments in the humanities frequently have fewer resources at their disposal than those in the sciences or medicine.
Meyer Luskin, 85, is president, CEO and chairman of Scope Industries, which recycles bakery waste to make an animal-feed ingredient. He said a $30 scholarship allowed him to continue his UCLA studies, which were interrupted by his military service in World War II, when he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps (later known as the Air Force).
“The multidisciplinary education I received at UCLA has helped me immeasurably in business, whether it’s organizational, management or philosophical issues, and I am eternally grateful,” said Luskin, a history enthusiast.
Luskin met his wife, Renee, while she was a UCLA student. She earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology in 1953. After completing his bachelor’s degree at UCLA, Meyer Luskin earned an M.B.A. from Stanford University in 1951.
The Luskins are longtime supporters of UCLA, with their generosity extending to endowments for undergraduate student scholarships and graduate student fellowships, a children’s clinic at Santa Monica–UCLA Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital, the alumni association and numerous advisory boards. Meyer Luskin also has served as chairman of the advisory board for the Santa Monica–UCLA Medical Center.
“UCLA is among the greatest universities in the world, and it gave me my start,” he said. “It’s essential that I give back so that others can enjoy the same benefits.”

Meyer Luskin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth           Celebrity Net Worth  Search Random  Meyer Luskin Net WorthHow much is Meyer Luskin Worth? in Richest Businessmen › CEOsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRandom CelebrityMeyer Luskin net worth:$1 Billion Meyer Luskin net worth: Meyer Luskin is a Los Angeles based entrepreneur and philanthropist who has a net worth of $1 billion. Meyer Luskin earned his net worth as the founder and CEO of Scope Industries. Scope Industries pioneered the process of recycling expired bakery products into animal feed. Scope removes waste from hundreds of bakeries and food manufacturers around the countries then processes the expired product into horse and cow feed. Luskin took over Scope Industries in the 1950s and has since grown it into a hugely profitable company that generates over $120 million per year in revenues. Thanks to Luskin's business acumen, Scope has grown at an average annual rate of 600%. The truly brilliant idea behind Scope is that it is literally making a fortune off someone else's trash and the end user (horses and cows) do not have high taste standards! Meyer Luskin is famous for donating $100 million to his alma mater UCLA. It was the second largest gift UCLA has ever received behind billionaire music mogul David Geffen's $200 million donation to UCLA's medical school in 2002. $50 million of Luskin's gift established the Meyer and Renee Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA, the other half is earmarked for constructing an off-campus conference center.Meyer Luskin Explaines why He Gives: Meyer Luskin Net Worth How To Make A Billion Dollars Out Of Bakery Garbage    Meyer LuskinMore CEOs Martin Shkreli Net Worth  Brian Sheth Net Worth  Don Blankenship Net Worth  Peter Szulczewski Net Worth  Apoorva Mehta Net Worth  Dana White Net Worth  Jimmy Iovine Net Worth  Marcus Lemonis Net Worth  Mark Hurd Net Worth  Mark Zuckerberg Net Worth  Share on FacebookAll net worths are calculated by applying a proprietary algorithm.

How To Make A Billion Dollars Out Of Bakery Garbage | Celebrity Net Worth           Celebrity Net Worth  Search Random  How To Make A Billion Dollars Out Of Bakery GarbageBy Brian Warner on March 20, 2014 in Articles › Celebrity NewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRandomizeCurrently Trending Jimmy Iovine Was Terrified That Tyrese Gibson Ruined The $3.2 Billion Apple Beats Dealon Jul 20, 2017  OJ Simpson Net Worth: 4 Facts You Need To Know Before His Parole Hearingon Jul 20, 2017  Carrie Fisher's 24-Year-Old Daughter Billie Lourd Named Beneficiary Of $25 Million Fortuneon Jul 20, 2017  Apple's Rumored New iPhone Just Turned This Guy Into The World's Newest Billionaireon Jul 21, 2017  50 Cent Reportedly Just Sold His Stake In Effen Vodka For $60 Millionon Jul 18, 2017  Quincy Jones Is Suing Michael Jackson's Estate For $30 Million!on Jul 20, 2017  One of the best parts about living in Los Angeles is that this city is full of inspirational people who made mind boggling fortunes off something totally random and unique. Sure we've got lots of wealthy actors, producers and directors but there are also thousands of extremely rich people in LA who made fortunes thanks to some absolutely random invention, business or product. When I need a jolt of inspiration, I jump in the car and drive a few minutes away to gaze at $50 – $100 million mansions. Recently, while driving through one of these billionaire neighborhoods, I happened upon one of the most incredible houses I'd ever seen. It was stunning. Imagine an all-glass palace high up on a hilltop with an infinity pool that overlooks all of LA. The house was so amazing that I marked the address on my phone and rushed home to research the everything I could find about the owner, Meyer Luskin. What I discovered about how Mr. Luskin made his fortune absolutely blew my mind. Hopefully the story of how Meyer Luskin became a billionaire thanks to discarded bakery garbage will amaze and inspire you as well…This photo doesn't do it justice but here is Meyer Luskin's incredible house from above:Meyer Luskin's HouseJust like Lynsi Torres, the 30 year old owner of In-N-Out burger, Meyer Luskin is an under the radar billionaire. You wont see Meyer in Forbes magazine or on TV bragging about his wealth. In fact, the only time Meyer has ever really spoken publicly was in 2011 after he donated $100 million to his alma mater UCLA. Luskin's gift was one of the largest private donations a university has ever received. In return, UCLA established the "Meyer And Renee Luskin School Of Public Affairs" and the "Luskin Center for Innovation". The school also plans to name their newest residence hall/conference center after the generous couple. Giving to UCLA was especially important to Meyer for three reasons: 1) As a student in the 1940s, Meyer wouldn't have been able to afford the tuition without a $30 dollar academic scholarship. 2) He met his wife of more than 60 years, Renee, while attending UCLA. And 3) in his own words: "The multidisciplinary education I received at UCLA has helped me immeasurably in business, whether it's organizational, management or philosophical issues, and I am eternally grateful". OK, so we've established that Meyer Luskin is a really good guy who loves UCLA, HOW'D HE GET SO RICH??!!Meyer and Renee Luskin Meyer Luskin is the 87 year old owner of Los Angeles-based Scope Industries. Scope Industries is the largest recycler of expired bakery and grain based byproducts in the United States. What does that mean? Let's say you own a bakery. If you don't sell your bread, bagels, pastries etc.. within a very specific time frame, they legally have to be discarded. You can't even donate slightly stale bread to a homeless shelter for health and sanitation reasons. The problem is, even mom and pop bakeries tend to produce a fairly large amount of waste that can't just be tossed in a regular trash can. Discard industrial quantities of bakery byproducts is very expensive. So what do they do? That's where Scope comes in. Scope designs and builds industrial waste compactors that are custom installed at the business. After installing the compactors, Scope then removes the waste several times per week.Expired Pastry RecyclingAt this point alone, Scope has carved out a nice little installation and recycling business for itself, but they are just getting started. Not only do pay them to haul away your garbage, brilliantly Scope then sells it all to a third party at a huge premium! After Scope removes the expired food, their trucks bring the it to one of 12 nationwide processing plants. The stale bagels, bread, tortillas, pizza, pasta, crackers chips and pastries are ground, dried and baked into "Dried Bakery Product". Farmers around the world pay top dollar for Scope's Dried Bakery Product to feed their cows, horses and chickens.But how much money can you make selling cow food? Scope Industries is a private company owned 100% by Meyer Luskin and has annual revenues of over $110 million. Essentially, Scope gets paid to convert someone else's trash into gold. And the best part is, their end consumer (cows, chickens, horses) have a never ending appetite and extremely low taste standards. It's a brilliant business model. Meyer Luskin's story is truly amazing and inspirational. Hopefully it will inspire you to go out an make a fortune off some random endeavor, like selling bakery garbage to every farmer in the world for a billion dollars!Meyer Luskin Interview:  Share on Facebook  Brian WarnerPrior to launching Celebrity Net Worth, Brian spent seven years as the Managing Editor of one of the largest entertainment portals on the internet.

About Us / About Meyer Luskin

About Meyer Luskin



“Sustaining the environment is the greatest inheritance one can leave to children, and the most enduring gift to community and nation.” -Meyer LuskinMeyer Luskin is no stranger to breaking down barriers and building bridges. His experience as a UCLA student and lifelong Angeleno served as inspiration for establishing a world class research center, one that would create a new model of problem solving by uniting the intellectual capital of UCLA with forward-looking civic leaders to address the most pressing issues confronting our community, nation, and world. "I live and work in the community and wanted to give back in a creative way that had not been done before," says Mr. Luskin. As a UCLA undergraduate, Luskin was not a traditional student.  He was a student athlete—on the boxing team —who commuted to campus, often with five other students, from the working class community of Boyle Heights.  After beginning his studies at UCLA, he left to serve in World War II.  Despite the barriers, Luskin persevered, eager to return to UCLA to complete his degree in economics.  "The education was wonderful and the stimulation was great," states Luskin.  In particular, Luskin "valued the interdisciplinary education" that he received. While not every economics major also has a strong background in history and philosophy, Luskin found these subjects not only fascinating but ultimately influential in his career as a businessman.  In particular, Luskin credits the philosophy of inductive logic and probability for helping him problem solve, think rationally about business decisions, and to know what can and cannot be controlled.  This philosophy has also helped him to remain notably humble and grateful for all he has achieved.  According to Luskin, "persistence is important but there is also an element of luck [to success in business].  One has to be thankful that situations beyond one's control work out. Ultimately, success is doing something that you enjoy doing." As the longtime President and CEO of Scope Industries, Luskin values and exemplifies environmental sustainability.  His company, which converts food waste products into animal food, certainly embodies the slogan reduce, reuse, and recycle.  Yet Luskin also realizes that "no one company has so much knowledge in so many disciplines as is needed to comprehensively address complex issues like environmental sustainability."  He and his wife Renee thought of UCLA as a place uniquely able to harness knowledge across fields.  "New knowledge and solutions have to come from a comprehensive viewpoint... and at UCLA there is such great brain power across a wide variety of fields." Renee and Meyer Luskin established the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation in 2008 with support from the UCLA Chancellor's Office.  Since then the Center has set an ambitious goal to produce cross-discplinary research that will help Los Angeles and the rest of the country reach the Holy Grail of environmental sustainability.  This is critical because as Luskin notes, "Sustaining the environment is the greatest inheritance one can leave to children, and the most enduring gift to community and nation." "I want the Center to make a significant impact on the lives of the people around us.  The Center is already achieving this and is headed exactly where it should be headed. I am very excited about the future of the Center."

UCLA Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center

When it comes to sustainability, we practice what we teach. Earning a LEED Platinum certification, the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center has taken ambitious steps towards integrating sustainability into all aspects of the facility and operation.
By incorporating sustainable technologies and building techniques, the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center demonstrates sustainable solutions in action and serves as a living laboratory supporting innovation and research breakthroughs. In line with the University of California’s comprehensive sustainability policy, the Luskin Conference Center has adopted sustainability commitments and goals in the following areas:
Green Building Design
Clean Energy and Climate Protection
Sustainable Water Systems
Recycling and Waste Management
Environmentally Preferable Purchasing
Sustainable Foodservice
Sustainable Transportation
 
LEED Platinum Certified Green Building Design

The Luskin Conference Center utilized the latest design/construction practices and technologies to conserve energy and water, and to maximize the use of recycled and renewable materials. As a result, the facility has achieved the coveted Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum Certification. LEED is the most widely used green building rating system in the world, and the certification process provides independent verification of a building’s sustainable features. LEED is the triple bottom line in action, benefiting people, planet, and profit through the creation of resource-efficient, high-performing, healthy, and cost-effective buildings. The Luskin Conference Center is one of over 30 LEED certified buildings on campus, and features a number of green building elements:
Fifty percent of the wood used is FSC certified from sustainably managed forests.
Thirteen percent of the building materials are comprised of recycled materials and 10% were procured from within 500 miles.
All materials used in the interior of the building are low Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOC).
The construction team diverted 96.5% of construction waste from landfill through the use of advanced recycling techniques.
Operable windows take advantage of natural light and facilitate natural air flow.
 
Energy & Water

The Luskin Conference Center has surpassed California’s stringent Title 24 energy code standards by over 20% through strategies such as LED lighting, occupancy sensors, natural ventilation, high-efficiency mechanical systems, cool white roofing, and high-performance windows. A portion of its electricity is generated on-site at the UCLA co-generation plant that is partially fueled by carbon neutral bio-gas. UCLA is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 through conservation, efficiency, renewable energy, and emission offsets.
In an effort to reduce water use, all guest rooms feature high-efficiency sinks, showers, and toilets. The Luskin Conference Center’s water-efficient landscape irrigation and plumbing fixtures yield 41% savings over baseline code requirements, saving an estimated 1.5 million gallons of water per year. Additionally, linen-free meeting spaces and the linen reuse program support water conservation.
Please help conserve energy and water by using these resources responsibly.

 
Zero Waste
The Luskin Conference Center strives to be a zero waste facility by eliminating the need to send waste to a landfill through the proper sorting and management of all waste materials. Please support this effort by sorting waste materials into the proper waste bin: Recycling, Compost, or Landfill.
        Recycling: All plastics, paper, cardboard, glass, aluminum, and metal items.
        Compost: All left-over food, food soiled paper products, and compostable room service containers.
        Landfill: True trash comprises a very small portion of our waste stream: personal hygiene items, chip bags, foil-lined wrappers.
In addition, the Luskin Conference Center donates all leftover shower amenities to Clean the World, an organization that recycles these items and distributes them to those in need.

 
Sustainable Amenities & Supplies

The Luskin Conference Center is committed to identifying and procuring sustainable products and supplies, ranging from sustainable shower amenities to Green Seal certified cleaning chemicals. The Luskin Conference Center is proud to offer biodegradable, plant-based shower amenities that are paraben and sulfate-free and are never tested on animals. The tubes contain 40% recycled plastic, and the cartons are made with 70% recycled materials.

 
Sustainable Food
The Luskin Conference Center’s in-house restaurant, Plateia, strives to source fresh, seasonal ingredients, with a minimum of 20% coming from sustainable, socially responsible, and humane sources. The Luskin Conference Center utilizes a defined list of criteria to identify sustainable ingredients:
        Local – Grown with 500 miles of campus
        Environmentally Friendly – I.e. USDA Certified Organic
        Fair Trade Certified
        Humane – I.e. Cage free or free-range

 
Sustainable Transportation

The Luskin Conference Center participates in the UCLA Sustainable Transportation program, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transport to, from, and around the campus. The program features 100% electric campus shuttles, electric carts, a bike sharing program, and Flyaway Shuttle service from Los Angeles International Airport using a natural gas-powered van. Conference center guests also have access to two car-sharing Zipcars. For more information regarding sustainable transportation options, click here.

 
Guest Participation
The Luskin Conference Center team invites guests to get involved in our sustainability efforts. Information on our sustainability program is provided to guests in the guest room compendium. Place cards are given to guests to indicate if their linens and towels need to be replaced or can be reused.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
