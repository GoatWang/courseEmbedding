Oil and Gas Blank-Check Company KLR Energy Completes IPO

The initial public offering (IPO) market may be gasping for air, but it’s not dead yet. Blank-check company KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: KLREU) completed an IPO Friday morning, raising $80 million on the sale of 8 million units at a per unit price of $10.
The special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. While it intends to focus on the oil and gas exploration and production industry, the company’s acquisitions will not be limited to that industry alone. 


The IPO is a good sign, but not that good. The company originally had planned to offer 13 million units at $10 each. Each unit is comprised of one share of class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of class A common stock at a price of $11.50 under certain conditions.

Sole bookrunner for the offering is EarlyBird Capital, and the co-manager is i-Bankers Securities. In addition to the ticker symbol for trading units, shares will trade under the symbol KLRE and warrants will trade under the symbol KLREW.
KLR Energy’s IPO follows by less than three weeks an upsized offering of 45 million units by another blank-check company that plans to acquire energy business. Silver Run Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: SRAQU) raised $450 million, the largest of this year’s IPOs to date.
KLR Energy’s units traded flat early Friday afternoon at $10.00, after posting a high of $10.07.
Silver Run units traded up 0.2% at 10.31, in a post-IPO range of $10.10 to $10.55.

HOUSTON, Dec. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. ("KLR Energy") (NASDAQ:   KLRE, KLREU, KLREW), an oil and gas exploration and production focused special purpose acquisition entity, today announced that it has entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Tema Oil and Gas Company ("Tema"), a private company with assets in the core of the Delaware Basin in Loving County, Texas. The transaction was unanimously approved by the respective boards of directors of the companies and is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of KLR Energy shareholder approval. Upon completion of the business combination, KLR Energy will change its name to Rosehill Resources Inc. ("Rosehill Resources") and will apply to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the new ticker symbols ROSE, ROSEU, ROSEW. Rosehill Resources intends to significantly accelerate drilling on Tema's high-quality operated acreage position and pursue strategic acquisitions.








In connection with the business combination, certain institutional investors will purchase $75 million of Rosehill Resources Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share and warrants (the "Private Placements").  In addition, Tema's parent, Rosemore, Inc. ("Rosemore") and KLR Energy's sponsor have agreed to purchase up to $20 million of Series A Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock in certain circumstances to backstop redemptions.  Together, the proceeds of the Private Placements and backstop by Rosemore and KLR Energy's sponsor will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration required to effect the business combination and for general corporate purposes. Following the closing of the transaction, Rosemore and its affiliates will collectively be the single largest stockholder of Rosehill Resources. KLR Energy is expected to retain a significant equity stake in Rosehill Resources and will have two representatives on Rosehill Resources' Board of Directors.
"This transaction represents exactly the type of business combination target we were seeking to provide to our investors when we took KLR Energy public earlier this year. Upon completion of the business combination, Rosehill Resources will be a pure-play, Delaware Basin focused exploration and production company with a strong balance sheet and outstanding growth potential. The management team of Rosehill Resources has a robust track record of value creation, a long history of successful energy investing and demonstrated financial discipline," said Gary Hanna, Chief Executive Officer of KLR Energy, who will serve as chairman of the board of directors of Rosehill Resources following the business combination.  Tema's management team will run Rosehill Resources post-transaction, led by J. A. (Alan) Townsend, President of Tema, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Rosehill Resources. "Rosehill Resources will have an excellent existing production base, a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and a deep bench of technical, land and operations expertise," said Townsend. "Tema has approximately 200 potential drilling locations on its existing acreage. That is about nine years of inventory assuming a 2-rig drilling program and doesn't include significant upside potential through a downspacing program. Following the business combination, we will immediately begin to accelerate development of the Tema assets while also pursuing focused acquisitions." 
The anticipated pro forma enterprise value of the combined company is approximately $445 million, implying a projected adjusted EBITDA multiple of 9.8x and 5.8x for calendar 2017 and 2018, respectively, and post-closing equity and preferred capitalization of $507 million at $10.40 per share (the foregoing assuming no stockholder redemptions). Rosehill Resources expects to have $117 million of projected liquidity to fund its development plan.
Rosehill Resources Operating Highlights

4,771 net acres in the core of the Delaware Basin, greater than 80% held by production and 99% operated 
Net production expected to be greater than 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in January, 2017 
70.1 million net barrels of oil equivalent of total 3P reserves as of June 2016, based on Ryder Scott reserve report 
Approximately 200 potential drilling locations on current leaseholds, includes stacked pay consisting of 10 benches totaling 3000 ft. of reservoir thickness 
Expected 9 years of inventory (using a 2-rig program) with significant upside through downspacing program 
Aligned veteran leadership, averaging 30+ years E&P operating experience, deep technical knowledge of the Delaware Basin and a 10+ year track record of drilling horizontal shale wells 

Business Combination
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Tema will contribute oil and gas properties and related assets to Rosehill Operating and KLR Energy will acquire 39% of the equity on a fully diluted basis of Rosehill Operating for $35 million in cash, the assumption of $55 million in debt and the contribution of remaining cash proceeds resulting from KLR Energy's initial public offering and the Private Placement.  Including the $310 million in equity of Rosehill Operating retained by Tema, this assumes an enterprise value of Rosehill Operating of $400 million.
In order to facilitate the transaction, Rosemore and KLR Energy's sponsor have agreed to backstop redemptions by the public stockholders of KLRE in excess of 30% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock by purchasing Class A Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock in an amount up to $20 million.
The closing of the transaction is subject to approval of KLR Energy stockholders and the satisfaction of customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017.
The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the combination, contribution and subscription agreements relating to the transaction.
Private Placement
In connection with the business combination, KLR Energy also announced that it has entered into Subscription Agreements with certain institutional investors to issue and sell in private placements a total of 75,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 5,000,000 warrants (each entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50) for gross proceeds of $75 million. The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 8.0% annual dividends, payable in cash or in-kind, and is convertible into shares of Rosehill Resources' Class A Common Stock based on a conversion price of $11.50 per share.  The proceeds of the private placement will be used to fund the cash portion of the consideration required to effect the combination and for general corporate purposes, including to finance development and potential acquisition activities following completion of the business combination.  The private placement is conditioned upon, and is expected to close concurrently with, the business combination.

our story


																
																KLR Group’s co-founders, led by Edward Kovalik, Stephen Lee and Reid Rubinstein, started the firm in 2012 with a simple goal: small, mid-sized and private companies within the Energy industry should have the same access to banking services as the largest public ones. Seeing a void in the market, they left an established banking platform with hundreds of employees to found KLR Group with a nimble team 
of twelve. Since 2012, the firm has grown its client base, employee count and number of investing partners (all high net worth individuals in Energy themselves). The majority owners of KLR Group have always been, and remain, its founders and employees.

The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of KLR Energy shareholder approval. Upon completion of the business combination, KLR Energy will change its name to Rosehill Resources Inc. ("Rosehill Resources").   Tema re-initiated its drilling and completion programs within its core Loving County acreage within the Delaware Basin in late 2016. Tema recently began production on the first three wells and has 15 more wells planned for 2017. The first well, completed mid-November, 2016 in the Lower Wolfcamp A formation, has a 4,306' lateral length and a peak 24-hour gross production rate of 1,389 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("Boepd"), of which 69% is oil. The second well, completed December 31, 2016 in the Lower Wolfcamp A formation, has a 4,612' lateral length and a peak 24-hour gross production rate of 1,859 Boepd, of which 82% is oil. The third well was completed over only 2,801' of the lateral length in the Upper Avalon shale on January 13, 2017. Although this well is still cleaning up, it has obtained a peak 24-hour gross rate of 866 Boepd, of which 73% is oil. Based on the well results to date, Tema's January 2017 exit rate was greater than 6,000 Boepd. As previously announced, Tema's management team will run Rosehill Resources post-transaction, led by J. A. (Alan) Townsend, President of Tema, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Rosehill Resources. "We are excited about re-starting our drilling and completion operations within our core acreage position in the heart of the play. Our program is off to a great start with three strong oil wells on line to date," said Townsend. "In designing this program, we set out to increase our drilling efficiencies and improve our hydraulic fracturing techniques, which have delivered strong initial results. The wells' production rates are exceeding our pre-drill internal estimates and compare favorably to regional peers."  Gary Hanna, Chief Executive Officer of KLR Energy, who will serve as chairman of the board of directors of Rosehill Resources following the business combination, commented, "We believe these initial well results demonstrate the potential of Tema's oil-rich acreage position in the Delaware Basin, and we are excited about the pending business combination. On that note, we recently filed our preliminary proxy statement, and are on track to bring this business combination to shareholder vote in the first half of this year. Upon completion of our business combination, we believe Rosehill Resources will emerge with an excellent existing production base, a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and a deep bench of technical, land and operations expertise poised to deliver growth potential to investors."

KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. and Tema Oil and Gas Company to Combine to form Rosehill Resources, a Pure-Play Delaware Basin CompanyConcurrent Private Placement will Position Rosehill Resources with Significant Growth Capital
HOUSTON, Dec. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. ("KLR Energy") (NASDAQ: KLRE, KLREU, KLREW), an oil and gas exploration and production focused special purpose acquisition entity, today announced that it has entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Tema Oil and Gas Company ("Tema"), a private company with assets in the core of the Delaware Basin in Loving County, Texas. The transaction was unanimously approved by the respective boards of directors of the companies and is expected to close in the first half of 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of KLR Energy shareholder approval. Upon completion of the business combination, KLR Energy will change its name to Rosehill Resources Inc. ("Rosehill Resources") and will apply to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the new ticker symbols ROSE, ROSEU, ROSEW. Rosehill Resources intends to significantly accelerate drilling on Tema's high-quality operated acreage position and pursue strategic acquisitions.
In connection with the business combination, certain institutional investors will purchase $75 million of Rosehill Resources Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share and warrants (the "Private Placements").  In addition, Tema's parent, Rosemore, Inc. ("Rosemore") and KLR Energy's sponsor have agreed to purchase up to $20 million of Series A Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock in certain circumstances to backstop redemptions.  Together, the proceeds of the Private Placements and backstop by Rosemore and KLR Energy's sponsor will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration required to effect the business combination and for general corporate purposes. Following the closing of the transaction, Rosemore and its affiliates will collectively be the single largest stockholder of Rosehill Resources. KLR Energy is expected to retain a significant equity stake in Rosehill Resources and will have two representatives on Rosehill Resources' Board of Directors.
"This transaction represents exactly the type of business combination target we were seeking to provide to our investors when we took KLR Energy public earlier this year. Upon completion of the business combination, Rosehill Resources will be a pure-play, Delaware Basin focused exploration and production company with a strong balance sheet and outstanding growth potential. The management team of Rosehill Resources has a robust track record of value creation, a long history of successful energy investing and demonstrated financial discipline," said Gary Hanna, Chief Executive Officer of KLR Energy, who will serve as chairman of the board of directors of Rosehill Resources following the business combination.  Tema's management team will run Rosehill Resources post-transaction, led by J. A. (Alan) Townsend, President of Tema, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Rosehill Resources. "Rosehill Resources will have an excellent existing production base, a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and a deep bench of technical, land and operations expertise," said Townsend. "Tema has approximately 200 potential drilling locations on its existing acreage. That is about nine years of inventory assuming a 2-rig drilling program and doesn't include significant upside potential through a downspacing program. Following the business combination, we will immediately begin to accelerate development of the Tema assets while also pursuing focused acquisitions." 
The anticipated pro forma enterprise value of the combined company is approximately $445 million, implying a projected adjusted EBITDA multiple of 9.8x and 5.8x for calendar 2017 and 2018, respectively, and post-closing equity and preferred capitalization of $507 million at $10.40 per share (the foregoing assuming no stockholder redemptions). Rosehill Resources expects to have $117 million of projected liquidity to fund its development plan.

Net production expected to be greater than 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in January, 2017 
70.1 million net barrels of oil equivalent of total 3P reserves as of June 2016, based on Ryder Scott reserve report

Business Combination

In order to facilitate the transaction, Rosemore and KLR Energy's sponsor have agreed to backstop redemptions by the public stockholders of KLRE in excess of 30% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock by purchasing Class A Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock in an amount up to $20 million.
The closing of the transaction is subject to approval of KLR Energy stockholders and the satisfaction of customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017.

("KLR Energy") (NASDAQ: KLRE, KLREU, KLREW), an oil and gas exploration and production focused special purpose acquisition entity, today announced recent well results for Tema Oil and Gas Company ("Tema"). KLR Energy and Tema, a private company with assets in the core of the Delaware Basin in Loving County, Texas, entered into a business combination agreement in December 2016, pursuant to which KLR Energy will acquire equity in a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tema to be named Rosehill Operating Company, LLC, to which Tema will contribute certain assets and liabilities prior to closing. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of KLR Energy shareholder approval. Upon completion of the business combination, KLR Energy will change its name to Rosehill Resources Inc. ("Rosehill Resources").  Tema re-initiated its drilling and completion programs within its core Loving County acreage within the Delaware Basin in late 2016. Tema recently began production on the first three wells and has 15 more wells planned for 2017. The first well, completed mid-November, 2016 in the Lower Wolfcamp A formation, has a 4,306' lateral length and a peak 24-hour gross production rate of 1,389 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("Boepd"), of which 69% is oil. The second well, completed December 31, 2016 in the Lower Wolfcamp A formation, has a 4,612' lateral length and a peak 24-hour gross production rate of 1,859 Boepd, of which 82% is oil. The third well was completed over only 2,801' of the lateral length in the Upper Avalon shale on January 13, 2017. Although this well is still cleaning up, it has obtained a peak 24-hour gross rate of 866 Boepd, of which 73% is oil. Based on the well results to date, Tema's January 2017 exit rate was greater than 6,000 Boepd.As previously announced, Tema's management team will run Rosehill Resources post-transaction, led by J. A. (Alan) Townsend, President of Tema, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Rosehill Resources. "We are excited about re-starting our drilling and completion operations within our core acreage position in the heart of the play. Our program is off to a great start with three strong oil wells on line to date," said Townsend. "In designing this program, we set out to increase our drilling efficiencies and improve our hydraulic fracturing techniques, which have delivered strong initial results. The wells' production rates are exceeding our pre-drill internal estimates and compare favorably to regional peers."Gary Hanna, Chief Executive Officer of KLR Energy, who will serve as chairman of the board of directors of Rosehill Resources following the business combination, commented, "We believe these initial well results demonstrate the potential of Tema's oil-rich acreage position in the Delaware Basin, and we are excited about the pending business combination. On that note, we recently filed our preliminary proxy statement, and are on track to bring this business combination to shareholder vote in the first half of this year. Upon completion of our business combination, we believe Rosehill Resources will emerge with an excellent existing production base, a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and a deep bench of technical, land and operations expertise poised to deliver growth potential to investors."About KLR Energy Acquisition Corp.KLR Energy is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.

	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account described below as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding shares of Class A common stock that were sold as part of the units in this offering, which (together with shares of Class A
	common stock purchased after this offering in the open market) we refer to collectively as our public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein.


	Our sponsor is KLR Energy Sponsor, LLC (which we refer to as our sponsor throughout this prospectus). The managing member of our sponsor is KLR Group Investments, LLC. Certain members of our management team are officers of KLR Group Investments, LLC.


	Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 warrants (or 8,950,000 warrants if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $0.75 per warrant ($6,232,500 in the aggregate, or $6,712,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) warrants, or the insider warrants, will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) warrants, or the EBC warrants, will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, in a
	private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to the insider warrants and EBC warrants collectively throughout this prospectus as the private placement warrants. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share.


	Prior to this offering, our sponsor purchased 2,300,000 shares of Class F common stock (up to 300,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised). The shares of Class F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the
	closing of the business combination, the ratio at which shares of Class F common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class F common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of this offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination or pursuant to warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account any shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination. Holders of the Class F common stock and holders of the Class A common stock will vote together as a single class on
	all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, except as required by law.


	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our units, Class A common stock or warrants. Our units have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol KLREU on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 90

	th

	day following the date of this prospectus unless EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, containing
	an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols KLRE and KLREW, respectively.


	We are an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. Investing in our securities involves risks.

	General


	We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any business combination targets and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.


	While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on the sector that complements our management teams expertise in the exploration, exploitation, operation and development of crude oil and natural gas wells and related infrastructure, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to source, screen, evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and manage acquisitions of attractive assets or businesses in the U.S. In the event that we find an acquisition opportunity in a different sector, or in a different geographic region, that is more compelling than the
	opportunities presented to us in to the U.S. oil and gas industry, we would pursue the opportunity in such other sector or such other geographic region. However, we have not established any particular parameters or criteria as to when we might turn our attention to opportunities outside of the U.S. oil and gas industry. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $400 million to $1 billion.


	Business Opportunity Overview


	Our strategy is to source, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build, an oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) business. E&P companies focus on finding, producing and marketing various forms of crude oil and natural gas. We believe that there is a unique and timely opportunity to achieve attractive returns by acquiring and developing E&P assets in proven basins with known operational and limited geologic risks. We believe this opportunity exists due to several key factors: (i) the recent decline of commodity prices had an immediate and meaningful impact on the cash flows of
	E&P companies, creating a need for many E&P firms to issue external capital or sell assets, (ii) the recent decline of commodity prices has substantially reduced E&P asset valuations and is moderating drilling and completion costs, and operating costs, resulting in a lower cost to acquire and develop, (iii) the short-term volatility and cyclical nature of commodity prices underpinned by a positive long-term outlook for crude oil and natural gas demand and the need for higher commodity prices to meet expected demand growth and (iv) the advantages enjoyed by E&P companies operating in the U.S., including access to industry-leading technologies and expertise, top-tier oil and gas-producing basins, established infrastructure and favorable political policies relative to other regions.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	We believe our management team is in a prime position to take advantage of opportunities within oil and gas and to create value for our stockholders. Our management team has a long history in oil and gas, with a deep knowledge of the industry and a well-established network of relationships with public and private oil and gas companies, equity sponsors, lending institutions, family offices, attorneys and brokers, from which we expect to generate attractive acquisition opportunities.

	Gary C. Hanna

	has over 30 years of executive experience in the energy exploration and production and service sectors, with a primary focus in the mid-continent U.S. and Gulf of Mexico regions. From 2009 until June 2014, Mr. Hanna served as the Chief Executive Officer of EPL Oil & Gas Inc., or EPL, and was elected as a director of EPL in June 2010 and Chairman in 2013. EPL was a public E&P company with a $270 million equity value in 2009 that Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, grew into a $2.3 billion company by the time it was sold to Energy XXI Ltd. in 2014. Following the reorganization of EPL in September 2009 and within a rising oil price environment in the four years following, the company completed acquisitions of new assets and executed organically through increasing capital spending. This combined approach resulted in a significant increases in proved reserves, production volumes and the companys
	drilling portfolio. The acquisitions provided EPL with access to infrastructure and extensive acreage, with significant exploitation and development potential. From 2009, the year the company reorganized, through 2013, the year prior to the sale of the company in June 2014, EPLs revenue increased from $191.6 million to $693.0 million and net income (loss) increased from $(57.1) million to $85.3 million. The price of oil increased from $55.07 in 2009 to $97.82 in 2013. From 2008 to 2009, Mr. Hanna served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Admiral Energy Services, a start-up company focused on the development of offshore energy services. From 1999 to 2007, Mr. Hanna served in various capacities at Tetra Technologies, Inc., an international oil and gas services production company, including serving as Senior Vice President from 2002 to 2007. Mr. Hanna also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Tetras affiliate, Maritech Resources, Inc., and as President
	of Tetra Applied Technologies, Inc., another Tetra affiliate. From 1996 to 1998, Mr. Hanna served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Gulfport Energy Corporation, a public oil and gas exploration company. From 1995 to 1998, he also served as the Chief Operations Officer for DLB Oil & Gas, Inc., a mid-continent exploration public company. From 1982 to 1995, Mr. Hanna served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hanna Oil Properties, Inc., a company engaged in oil services and the development of mid-continent oil and gas prospects. Since November 2015, Mr. Hanna has served as a member of the boards of directors of Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Aspire Holdings Corp.

	Gregory R. Dow

	has served as the Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel of KLR Holdings since April 2012. Mr. Dow was General Counsel at Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group, Inc. from February 2008 until April 2012 and a Managing Director and the Deputy General Counsel at Cowen and Company, LLC from May 2004 until December 2007. From 1998 through 2004, Mr. Dow was a Director and the Equity Capital Markets Counsel at Merrill Lynch, serving in New York and in London, where he covered the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Prior to that, he was Equity Capital Markets Counsel at Peregrine Capital Markets in Hong Kong, which at the time was the largest independent investment bank in Asia. Mr. Dow began his legal career at the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy, where he focused on Latin America. Mr. Dow also had five years of experience in strategic consulting with Taylor Research and Greenwich Associates, where he focused on
	telecommunications, media and financial industry clients.




	We have assembled a group of independent directors who will bring us public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, industry knowledge, private equity investment management and capital markets experience. Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEOs, CFOs and in other executive and advisory capacities for numerous publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger
	candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.


	Mr. Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer, is currently restricted by a non-compete provision contained in his consulting agreement with Energy XXI (Bermuda) Ltd., or Energy XXI, which provision is in effect until June 3, 2016. Such provision prohibits Mr. Hanna from acquiring or managing certain businesses in the shallow Gulf of Mexico that broadly compete with the business activities of Energy XXI. In light of the non-competition agreement, we will not seek an initial business combination with any company operating in the businesses described above, unless such transaction were to close subsequent to the expiration of the
	non-competition provision.


	None of the members of our management team, the sponsor, KLR Group or KLR Holdings has previous experience as sponsor or in a management capacity with other blank check companies.


	Initial Business Combination


	NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the
	satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on NASDAQ after this offering, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of our initial business combination, although we would not be obligated to do so pursuant to any contractual or charter provision or otherwise.


	We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or
	acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less
	than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.


	Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.






	



	Middle-Market Focus.

	  We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $400 million to $1 billion, determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe that this segment of the market presents the greatest number of opportunities for investment. Additionally, KLR Group predominantly advises companies in this segment and has a broad network of established relationships.








	



	Operations in the U.S.

	  We will seek to acquire one or more companies with oil and gas operations within the U.S., specifically in the Lower 48. Our management team has substantial experience building and operating offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico, but given current opportunities in the market we prefer to focus onshore. We will seek assets in any of the proven, producing oil and gas basins with sufficient access to infrastructure and end markets.








	



	Producing Reserves and Future Development Upside.

	  We will seek to acquire one or more companies with significant reserves classified as proved developed producing (PDP) and generating cash flow from production. We will also seek undeveloped inventory that is economic to develop based on forward strip pricing and regional pricing forecasts, which will serve as future inventory for development and a growth driver for our company. We will not seek to acquire only undeveloped acreage.








	



	High Quality Geology.

	  We will seek to acquire assets or companies that have acreage with high reservoir quality rock that has been proven to be productive. We prefer areas that allow us to develop and produce out of multiple horizons within one geologic formation, multiple productive geologic formations or stacked pay that can be developed from a single location on the surface and potential for increased production through down-spacing, enhanced recovery methods (e.g., waterfloods) or other means.








	



	Optimization of Operations.

	  We will seek to acquire assets or companies with opportunities to reduce costs, boost production or otherwise optimize operations that would result in improved economics and returns to stockholders.








	



	Companies with Strong Operating Teams.

	  We will seek to acquire one or more companies with a management team that has a proven track record operating their assets. We prefer companies that have expertise in the area in which their assets are located. We also prefer teams that have had a high degree of success developing assets with minimal execution missteps resulting in mechanical failure or other issues. Additionally, we will seek management teams that have successfully lowered operating costs through development efficiencies, technical expertise and strong contractual know-how.




	These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. We believe we can source

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	acquisition targets consistent with the acquisition criteria from family-owned companies, sponsored companies, distressed companies, and non-core assets of large companies, among others.


	In addition, the members of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience with E&P companies. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will be useful for sourcing investment opportunities. This network has been developed through our management teams experience in:






	


	sourcing, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; and








	


	executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.




	This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Our president, in connection with his duties at KLR and Rodman & Renshaw, has raised and
	participated in over $2 billion in equity, over $1 billion in debt and $900 million in M&A transactions over the past five years.


	In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.


	We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.


	Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following this offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. For
	additional information regarding our executive officers and directors business affiliations and potential conflicts of interest, see Management  Directors and Executive Officers and Management  Conflicts of Interest.


	Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us
	if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check

	company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 18 months after the closing of this offering.


	We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
	obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.


	We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30

	th

	, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall
	have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.


	Our executive offices are located at 811 Main Street, 18

	The Offering




	In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the backgrounds of the members of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section below entitled Risk Factors beginning on page

	of this prospectus.

	The units will begin trading promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 90

	th

	day following the date of this prospectus unless EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the shares of Class A common stock and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Class A common stock and warrants.






	Separate trading of the Class A common stock and warrants is prohibited until we have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K



	 


	 







	 



	 


	In no event will the Class A common stock and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering, which is anticipated to take place three business days from the date of this prospectus. If the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option.

	30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, and










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	12 months from the closing of this offering;










	 


	 







	 



	 


	provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or holders are permitted to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement).









	 


	 







	 



	 


	We are not registering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC and no later than 90 days after the closing of our initial business combination, have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of our initial business combination, public warrant holders may, until such time
	as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless
	basis.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the trust account.






	Redemption of warrants



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):

	at a price of $0.01 per warrant;

	upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, which we refer to as the 30-day redemption period; and










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	if, and only if, the last sale price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.










	 


	 







	 



	 


	We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market
	value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Please see the section entitled Description of Securities  Warrants  Public Stockholders Warrants for additional information.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial purchasers of the private placement warrants or their permitted transferees.






	Founder shares



	 


	 







	 



	 


	In November 2015, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. In December 2015 and February and March 2016, our sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,972,500 founder shares, which we cancelled, leaving an aggregate of 2,300,000 founder shares outstanding after the return of 40,000 founder shares discussed below. To the extent the underwriters over-allotment option is unexercised, our sponsor will forfeit up to 300,000 founder shares so that its remaining founder shares would represent 20.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of this offering (assuming it does not purchase any units in this offering). Prior to the initial investment in us of $25,000 by our sponsor, we

	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	had no assets, tangible or intangible. The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to us by the number of founder shares issued. In January 2016, our sponsor transferred 150,000 shares to Ms. Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, 50,000 shares to Mr. Dow, our Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and 10,000 shares each to Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, our director nominees. In March 2016, Mr. Dow and Ms. Thom returned to us, at no cost, 10,000 and 30,000 founder shares, respectively, which we cancelled. If we increase or decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders prior to
	this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering. Our initial stockholders will own 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering).









	 


	 







	 



	 


	The founder shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units being sold in this offering, except that:

	the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below;










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they
	hold if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame). If we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 3,000,001 of the 8,000,000 public shares, or 37.5%, sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and no shares are purchased by such parties in this offering); and

	initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described in more detail below under the heading Founder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights.






	Transfer restrictions on founder shares



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our initial stockholders have agreed that 50% of their founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to
	exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property (except as described herein under Principal Stockholders  Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants). Any permitted transferees would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our sponsor with respect to any founder shares. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the lock-up.






	Founder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights



	 


	 







	 



	 


	The shares of Class F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the business combination, the ratio at which shares of Class F common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class F common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of this offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in
	connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination or pursuant to warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account any shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination.

	Private placement warrants



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed, pursuant to written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 private placement warrants (or 8,950,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) EBC warrants will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, at a price of $0.75 per warrant ($6,232,500 in the aggregate, or $6,712,500 in the aggregate if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. The purchase price of the private placement warrants will be added to the proceeds from this
	offering to be held in the trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees (except as described below under Principal Stockholders  Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants). If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial holders or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering.
	Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital has agreed that it and/or its designees will not be permitted to exercise any EBC warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.






	Transfer restrictions on private placement warrants



	 


	 







	 



	 


	The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.






	Gross Proceeds to be held in trust account



	 


	 







	 



	 


	The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the approximately $86.2 million in proceeds we will receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately $98.7 million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full, $83.2 million, or approximately $95.7 million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.40 per unit in either case), will be deposited into a segregated trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and an aggregate of

	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	approximately $1.0 million will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct the depositary bank designated by us to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as discussed below and subject to the requirements of law and stock exchange rules, will provide that none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders.






	Anticipated expenses and funding sources



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, no proceeds held in the trust account will be available for our use, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes. Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, we may pay our expenses only from:









	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account, which will be approximately $725,000 in working capital (including up to $275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination) after the payment of approximately $582,500 in expenses relating to this offering; and

	any loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates or other third parties, although they are under no obligation to advance funds or invest in us, and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion of a business combination.







	Conditions to completing our initial business combination



	 


	 







	 



	 


	The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We currently do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an





	14

	independent investment banking firm. We will complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or
	businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.






	Permitted purchases of public shares by our affiliates



	 


	 







	 



	 


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases
	are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply





	15



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	with such rules. Our initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any purchases if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.






	Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination



	 


	 







	 



	 


	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.40 per public share. Up to $300,000 in deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters, in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, only on completion of an initial business combination.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.






	Manner of conducting redemptions



	 


	 







	 



	 


	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20.0% of our outstanding common stock or seek
	to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:









	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and






	16



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and









	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.










	 


	 







	 



	 


	Upon the public announcement of our business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more
	shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:









	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	file proxy materials with the SEC.










	 


	 







	 



	 


	If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective

	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required
	to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.






	Redemption rights in connection with proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain charter provisions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our common stock, subject to
	applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholders, who will beneficially own 20.0% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner it chooses. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our





	18



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.






	Release of funds in trust account on closing of our initial business combination



	 


	 







	 



	 


	On the completion of our initial business combination, all amounts held in the trust account will be released to us, except that up to $300,000 in deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters. In the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we will use these funds to pay amounts due to any public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights as described above under Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination, to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our initial business combination and to pay other expenses associated with our initial business combination. If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the
	consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.






	Redemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no initial business combination



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we will have only 18 months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as
	reasonably possible following such redemption,





	19



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 18-month time period. In addition, deferred commissions will not be released to the underwriters if we fail to complete our business combination within such timeframe.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they (along with any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates who acquire public share during or after this offering) will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time frame.









	 


	 







	 



	 


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs
	penny stock rules).






	Limited payments to insiders



	 


	 







	 



	 


	There will be no finders fees, reimbursements or cash payments made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:









	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	Repayment of an aggregate of up to $275,000 in loans made or to be made to us by KLR Energy Sponsor, LLC, our sponsor, to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;

	Reimbursement to an affiliate of our sponsor for certain expenses to be incurred in connection with our employment of Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, including employment related taxes (to be paid in connection with Ms. Thoms annual salary) and health benefits;










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination;










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	Repayment of loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including $275,000 in loans made or to be made as described herein) may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender; and










	 


	 







	 



	 



	  


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon or after the consummation of such business combination. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest.










	 


	 







	 



	 


	There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses or loans reimbursable or repayable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses or loans exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses or loans would not be reimbursed or repaid by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.






	Audit Committee



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Prior to the effectiveness of this registration statement, we will have established and will maintain an audit committee (which will be comprised of all independent directors) to, among other things, monitor compliance with the terms described above and the other terms relating to this offering. If any noncompliance is identified, then the audit committee will be charged with the responsibility to immediately take all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise to cause compliance with the terms of this offering. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. For more information, see the section entitled Management  Committees of the Board of Directors  Audit Committee.






	Indemnification of Trust Account



	 


	 







	 



	 


	Edward Kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering





	21



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS






	 



	 


	into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Kovalik has sufficient funds to
	satisfy its indemnity obligations and, therefore, Mr. Kovalik may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked Mr. Kovalik to reserve for such eventuality. We believe the likelihood Mr. Kovalik having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.

	Risks



	We are a newly formed company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check
	offerings.

	If no business combination is completed within 18 months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month time period.

	RISK FACTORS



	An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.



	We are a newly formed development stage company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.


	We are a recently formed development stage company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our business combination. If we fail to complete our business combination, we will never generate any operating
	revenues.


	Our independent registered public accounting firms report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


	As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $106,000 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficiency of approximately $98,000. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. Managements plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate this offering or our inability to continue as a going concern.


	Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.


	We may not hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable state law or the rules of NASDAQ or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. For instance, the NASDAQ rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination
	that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination. However, except for as required by law, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock do not approve of the business combination we consummate. Please see the section entitled Proposed Business  Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination for additional information.


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and our executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.


	Our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, as well as any public shares purchased during or after this offering, in favor of our initial business combination. Our initial stockholders will own

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	20.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the completion of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). In addition, our executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our initial stockholders and our executive officers, directors and director nominees agreed
	to vote their founder shares and public shares, as applicable, in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders.


	Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of the business combination.


	At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such stockholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set
	forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination.


	The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.


	We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs
	penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.


	The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.


	At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if
	a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.

	The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination is not consummated and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock.


	If the definitive agreement for our business combination requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would not be consummated is increased. If our initial business combination is not consummated, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account in connection with our liquidation. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade
	at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market.


	The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.


	Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to
	conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.


	We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within such time period. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
	aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our common stock.


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof
	and

	therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with
	a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.


	In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our common stock and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.


	If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.


	We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem
	public shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See Proposed Business  Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights.


	You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.


	Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, and (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In addition, if our plan to redeem our public shares if we are unable to complete an
	initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering is not completed for any reason, compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account. In that case, public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond 18 months from the closing of this offering before they receive funds from our trust account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.


	NASDAQ may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.


	Our units have been approved for listing on NASDAQ promptly after the date of this prospectus and our Class A common stock and warrants listed promptly after their date of separation. Although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the NASDAQ listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will be, or will continue to be, listed on NASDAQ in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on NASDAQ prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain
	financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 round-lot holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate



	28



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	compliance with NASDAQs initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than NASDAQs continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on NASDAQ. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4 per share and our stockholders equity would generally be required to be at least $5 million. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.


	If NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:






	


	a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;








	


	reduced liquidity for our securities;








	


	a determination that our Class A common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;








	


	a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and








	


	a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.




	The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ, our units, Class A common stock and warrants will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent
	activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.


	You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.


	Since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, because we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to
	protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable. Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, please see Proposed Business  Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a stockholder or a group of stockholders holding a substantial portion of our Class A common stock may influence our ability to complete our business combination.


	Unlike other blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) holding in excess of any certain percentage of shares offered in our initial public offering will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any shares they hold. The ability of any such stockholder to redeem all their shares will increase their influence over our ability to complete our business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us.


	Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share, on our redemption, and our warrants will expire worthless.


	We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
	or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, if we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class A common stock redeemed and, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination, we make purchases of our Class A common stock, potentially reducing the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
	negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	If the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 18 months, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination.


	The funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that our initial business combination is not completed during that time. We believe that, upon the closing of this offering, the funds available to us outside of the trust account, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 18 months; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also
	use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	If the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search, to pay our income taxes and to complete our business combination.


	Of the net proceeds of this offering, only approximately $725,000 (including up to $275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our business combination) will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	working capital requirements. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $582,500, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $582,500, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to
	operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.40 per share on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless.


	Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.


	Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due
	diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or
	directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.


	If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.40 per share.


	Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement,
	breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.


	Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by



	31



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption
	right in connection with our business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.40 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Mr. Kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, except as to any claims by a
	third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Kovalik has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and, therefore, Mr. Kovalik may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked Mr. Kovalik to reserve for such eventuality.


	Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our President, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.


	In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.40 per share or (ii) other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, and Mr. Kovalik asserts that he is unable to satisfy his obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr.
	Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.40 per share.


	If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.


	If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith,
	thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.

	If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.


	If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.


	If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.


	If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:






	


	restrictions on the nature of our investments, and








	


	restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.




	In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:






	


	registration as an investment company;








	


	adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and








	


	reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.




	We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will be restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. If we were
	deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate a business combination. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.


	Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it,
	including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the

	amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18

	th

	month from the closing of this offering in the event we do not complete our business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures.


	Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our
	plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering is not considered a liquidation distribution
	under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.


	We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after our consummation of a business combination and you will not be entitled to any of the corporate protections provided by such a meeting.


	We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate a business combination (unless required by NASDAQ), and thus may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with a companys bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our consummation of a business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in
	accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.


	We are not registering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless.


	We are not registering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of our initial business combination, to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and no later than 90 days after the closing of our initial business combination to use our best efforts to have an effective registration statement covering such shares, and to maintain
	a current prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the
	state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. In no event will we be required to

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit
	purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units.


	The grant of registration rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.


	Pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this offering, our initial stockholders and EarlyBirdCapital and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the founder shares, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public
	market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our initial stockholders, holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered.


	Unlike most other similarly structured blank check companies, our initial stockholders will receive additional Class A common stock if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.


	The founder shares will automatically convert into Class A common stock on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities convertible or exercisable for Class A common stock, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which founder shares shall convert into Class A common stock will be adjusted so that the number of Class A common
	stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of the initial business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination. This is different from most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination.


	Because we are not limited to a particular industry or any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations.


	We will seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in the energy sector, but may also pursue acquisition opportunities with other characteristics, except that we will not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet identified or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations, results of
	operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or



	35



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our executive officers, directors, director nominees and members of our sponsor will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a
	target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.


	We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors outside the energy sector, which may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise.


	We will consider an initial business combination outside the energy sector (which sectors may or may not be outside our managements areas of expertise) if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to
	investors in this offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our managements expertise, our managements expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our managements expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire.


	Although we identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.


	Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a
	greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	We may seek investment opportunities with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings.


	To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our executive officers, directors and director

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	nominees will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.


	We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view.


	Unless we complete our business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.


	We may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon the conversion of the Class F common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained therein. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 6,000,000 shares of Class F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after this offering, there will be 10,690,000 and 4,000,000 (assuming, in each case, that the underwriters have not exercised their over-allotment option) authorized but unissued shares of Class A and Class F common stock available, respectively, for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for
	issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants but not upon the conversion of the Class F common stock. Shares of Class F common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein. Immediately after this offering, there will be no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.


	We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the Class F common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained therein. However our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue
	additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock:






	


	may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering;








	


	may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;








	


	could cause a change in control if a substantial number of common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present executive officers and directors; and








	


	may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, common stock and/or warrants.

	Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons
	including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.


	We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate.


	Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Kovalik and our other executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have completed our business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the
	related due diligence. We do not have key-man insurance on the life of any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.


	Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.


	Our ability to successfully effect our business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.
	These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.


	None of our executive officers or directors has ever been associated with a special purpose acquisition corporation and such lack of experience could adversely affect our ability to consummate a business combination.


	None of our executive officers or directors has ever been associated with a special purpose acquisition corporation. Accordingly, you may not have sufficient information with which to evaluate their ability to identify and consummate a business combination using the proceeds of this offering. Our managements lack of experience in operating a special purpose acquisition corporation could adversely affect our ability to consummate a business combination and could result in our not completing a business combination in the prescribed time frame.

	Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.


	Our key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and
	selecting a target business. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination.


	We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.


	When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the targets management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the targets management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be
	negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.


	The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination targets key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidates key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidates management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is
	possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.


	Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.


	Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our business combination. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current
	commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. For a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors other business affairs, please see Management  Directors and Executive Officers.

	Certain of our executive officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.


	Following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and executive officers and directors are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business.


	Our executive officers, directors and director nominees also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties, including KLR Group. Mr. Kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for us are not independent from KLR Group and have other responsibilities within KLR Group. Conflicts related to the allocation of potential business opportunities to us will be considered and resolved on a case-by-case and discretionary basis by KLR Group, including Mr. Kovalik. Accordingly, they may have conflicts
	of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.


	For a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see Management  Directors and Executive Officers, Management  Conflicts of Interest and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.


	Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.


	We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types
	conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.


	In addition, certain of our executive officers and directors, including Mr. Kovalik, are employed by KLR Group, which provides investment banking services to a wide variety of clients. Mr. Kovalik and certain of our other officers who may make decisions for our business will concurrently work for and receive compensation relating to such investment banking services. Such compensation may incentivize them to serve the interests of KLR Groups investment banking business and its clients over our interests.


	We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest.


	In light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers and directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under Management  Conflicts of Interest. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our business combination with any
	entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business

	combination as set forth in Proposed Business  Effecting our initial business combination  Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our executive officers, directors or existing holders,
	potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.


	Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.


	In November 2015, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. In December 2015 and February and March 2016, our sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,972,500 founder shares, which we cancelled. In addition, in January 2016, our sponsor transferred 150,000 shares to Ms. Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, 50,000 shares to Mr. Dow, our Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and 10,000 shares each to Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, our director nominees. In March 2016, Mr. Dow and Ms. Thom returned to us, at no
	cost, 10,000 and 30,000 founder shares, respectively, which we cancelled. To the extent the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, our sponsor may forfeit up to 300,000 founder shares so that the remaining founder shares would represent 20.0% of the outstanding shares upon completion of this offering (assuming it does not purchase any units in this offering). The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 (or 8,950,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) EBC warrants will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), each exercisable for one share of
	our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, for a purchase price of $6,232,500 (or $6,712,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), or $0.75 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination. In addition, our sponsor has loaned or will loan us up to $275,000, which loans are not payable until the closing of our business combination.


	The founders shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units being sold in this offering, except that (i) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, (ii) our initial stockholders, officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (b) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares
	if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame) and (iii) the founder shares are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described herein.


	Additionally, in connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees.


	The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination.

	Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will not be eligible to be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses if our business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.


	At the closing of our initial business combination, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf. These financial interests of our sponsor, executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business
	combination and completing an initial business combination.


	We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders investment in us.


	Although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our business combination. We have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:






	


	default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;








	


	acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;








	


	our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;








	


	our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;








	


	our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;








	


	using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;








	


	limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;








	


	increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and








	


	limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.




	We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.


	The net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of warrants will provide us with $83,650,000 (or $96,130,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) that we may use to

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	complete our business combination, less up to $300,000 in deferred commissions to be released to the underwriters, in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, upon completion of an initial business combination.


	We may effectuate our business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity
	our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:






	


	solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or








	


	dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.




	This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our business combination.


	We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.


	If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with
	the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.


	We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.


	In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. By definition, very little public information exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.


	Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.


	We may structure a business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction
	company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination



	43



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common
	stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the companys stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.


	We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders seek redemption.


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (such that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. As a result, we may be able to complete our business combination even though a substantial majority of our
	public stockholders have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.


	In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders may not support.


	In order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination and extended deadlines to complete business combinations. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments in order to effectuate our initial business combination.


	The provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support.


	Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a companys pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the companys stockholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the companys public stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the
	private placement

	of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock, and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a
	majority of our common stock, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholders, who will beneficially own 20.0% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner it chooses. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
	aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in letter agreements that we have entered into with our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees. Our public stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our public stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.


	We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.


	Although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant
	number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment has made it especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to
	secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our executive officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.40 per share on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless.

	Our initial stockholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.


	Upon the closing of this offering, our initial stockholders will own 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If our initial stockholders or our executive officers and directors purchase any units in this offering or if our initial stockholders or our executive officers and directors purchase any additional shares of common stock in
	the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase such control.


	In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our sponsor, is and will be divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors
	will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our business combination.


	Our sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000, or approximately $0.01 per founder share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our Class A common stock.


	The difference between the public offering price per share (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the common stock and none to the warrant included in the unit) and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon the closing of this offering, and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants included in the units, you and the other public stockholders will incur an immediate and substantial
	dilution of approximately 79.5% (or $7.95 per share, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option), the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share of $2.05 and the initial offering price of $10.00 per unit. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class F common stock result in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class F common stock at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek redemptions from the trust. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class A common stock.


	We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants.


	Our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65%
	of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.

	We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.


	We have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants
	at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.


	Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our business combination.


	We will be issuing warrants to purchase 8,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock (or up to 9,200,000 shares of Class A common stock if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) as part of the units offered by this prospectus and, simultaneously with the closing of this offering, we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of 8,310,000 (or up to 8,950,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock
	to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and reduce the value of the shares of Class A common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.


	The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in this offering except that, so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.


	The determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry. You may have less assurance, therefore, that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company.


	Prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriters. In determining the size of this offering, management held customary organizational meetings with representatives of the underwriters, both prior to our inception and thereafter, with respect to the state of capital markets, generally, and the amount the underwriters believed they reasonably could raise on our behalf. Factors considered in determining the size of this offering, prices and terms of the units, including the Class A
	common stock and warrants underlying the units, include:






	


	the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies;








	


	prior offerings of those companies;








	


	our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values;








	


	a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions;








	


	our capital structure;

	TABLE OF CONTENTS







	


	an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies;








	


	general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering; and








	


	other factors as were deemed relevant.




	Although these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results.


	There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.


	There is currently no market for our securities. Stockholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering, the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.


	Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.


	The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financing reporting standards,
	or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.


	We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.


	We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
	compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.


	Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as
	an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.


	Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.


	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal
	control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.


	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A common stock and could entrench management.


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.


	We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.


	If we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the United States, or with operations located outside the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.


	If we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the United States, or with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:

	costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;

	We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.


	We may face risks related to oil and gas exploration and production companies.


	Business combinations with oil and gas exploration and production companies entail special considerations and risks. If we acquire a target business in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we may be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the following risks:






	


	our success may be dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas;








	


	low oil or natural gas prices and the substantial volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations;








	


	our exploration, development and exploitation projects may require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth;








	


	drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of operational and financial risk, with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business;








	


	we may incur indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs;








	


	our operations may be subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured;








	


	our reserves and production may be concentrated in a few core areas, such that problems in production and markets relating to a particular area could have a material impact on our business;








	


	the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;








	


	our oil and natural gas reserves may be estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will recover, and significant inaccuracies in these reserves estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves;








	


	our identified drilling locations may be scheduled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling;

	TABLE OF CONTENTS







	


	competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may make it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel;








	


	our competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively;








	


	strategic relationships upon which we may rely may be subject to change, which may diminish our ability to conduct our operations;








	


	the marketability of our production may be dependent upon oil and natural gas gathering, processing and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties, and the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas gathering, processing and transportation arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our revenue;








	


	financial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third party operators or other third parties could decrease our cash flows from operations and adversely affect the exploration and development of our prospects and assets;








	


	gathering, processing and transportation services are subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business;








	


	a component of our growth may come through acquisitions, and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and hamper our growth;








	


	we may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, and, as a result, we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations;








	


	we may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest;








	


	we may be required to write down the carrying value of our proved properties under accounting rules and these write-downs could adversely affect our financial condition;








	


	hedging transactions, or the lack thereof, may limit our potential gains and could result in financial losses;








	


	we may be subject to government regulation and liability, including complex environmental laws, which could require significant expenditures; and








	


	we may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.

	In addition, as of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $275,000 ($206,000 as of the date of this prospectus) to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering, as described in this prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of our initial business combination. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

	Does not include up to $300,000 payable to the underwriters, if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full for deferred underwriting commissions to be placed in a trust account as described herein. The deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business combination.

	These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category
	of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans outstanding as of the date of this prospectus) may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
	at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.








	(5)


	Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a no shop provision and commitment fees for financing.

	Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of this offering.




	The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, $83,200,000 (or $95,680,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
	Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of law).


	The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination. If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
	principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital, or up to $300,000 in deferred underwriting commissions, in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option.


	We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
	business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital,

	the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.


	Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of this offering.


	As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $275,000 ($206,000 as of the date of this prospectus), to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the closing of our initial business combination.


	In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
	outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans described above) may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present
	conflicts of interest.


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
	purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.


	We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the
	business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.


	A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares

	of our Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.


	Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our initial stockholders (or any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or
	after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.

	DIVIDEND POLICY


	We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring
	any stock dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, in which case we will effect a stock dividend or other appropriate mechanism immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders prior to this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

	DILUTION


	The difference between the public offering price per share of Class A common stock, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock after this offering, assuming all shares of Class F common stock converted into shares of Class A common stock one-for-one basis, constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement
	warrants, which would cause the actual dilution to the public stockholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class A common stock which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.


	At December 31, 2015, our net tangible book deficit was $98,212, or approximately $(0.04) per share of common stock. After giving effect to the sale of 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at December 31, 2015 would have been $5,000,010 or $2.05 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 7,563,969 shares of Class A common
	stock that may be redeemed for cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) of $2.09 per share to our initial stockholders as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution of $7.95 per share or 79.5% to our public stockholders not exercising their redemption rights. The decrease attributable to public shares subject to redemption is included in the calculation below at $10.00 per share, as all public stockholders have the right to redeem. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full would be an immediate dilution of $8.19 per share or 81.9%.


	The following table illustrates the dilution to the public stockholders on a per-share basis, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units or the private placement warrants:

	For purposes of presentation, we have reduced our pro forma net tangible book value after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) by $78,665,278 because holders of up to approximately 94.5% of our public shares may redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account at a per-share redemption price equal to the amount in the trust account as set forth in our tender offer or proxy materials (initially anticipated to be the aggregate amount held in trust two days prior to the commencement of our tender offer or stockholders meeting,
	including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering).

	Upon the completion of our initial business combination, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) subject to the limitations described herein whereby our net tangible assets will be maintained at a minimum of $5,000,001 and any limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. The value of Class A common stock that may be redeemed is equal to $10.40 per share, whether the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full or not (which is the assumed redemption price), multiplied by 7,563,969 shares of Class A common stock, which is the maximum number of

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

	FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	Overview


	We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private
	placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.


	The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination:






	


	may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class F common stock resulted in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class F common stock;








	


	may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;








	


	could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present executive officers and directors;








	


	may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and








	


	may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants.




	Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:






	


	default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;








	


	acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;








	


	our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;








	


	our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;








	


	our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;








	


	using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;








	


	limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;








	


	increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and








	


	limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $106,000 in cash and deferred offering costs of $113,500. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful.


	Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events


	We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this
	offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering.




	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $106,000 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficiency of approximately $98,000. Further, we have incurred costs in connection with our formation and this offering and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Managements plans to address this uncertainty through this offering are discussed above. Our plans to raise capital or to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
	our ability to continue as a going concern. Our liquidity needs have been satisfied to date through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares to our sponsor and loans from our sponsor of $175,000. We estimate that the net proceeds from (i) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $582,500, underwriting commissions of $2,000,000 and (ii) the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of $6,232,500 (or $6,712,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be approximately $83.7 million (or approximately $96.1 million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full). $83.2 million (or approximately $95.7 million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be held in the trust account. Up to $300,000 in deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters, in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, only on
	completion of an initial business combination. The remaining approximately $725,000 (including up to $275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination) will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $582,500, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $582,500, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.


	We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay income taxes. The interest earned on the amount in the trust account may not be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the
	operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.


	Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the approximately $725,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (including up to $275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination). We will use these funds primarily to pay the salary of our Chief Financial Officer, identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
	businesses or

	their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay income taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our income taxes.


	In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such
	repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans described above) may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.


	We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $250,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; $75,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $75,000 for NASDAQ and other regulatory fees; $300,000 as salary for our Chief Financial Officer; and $25,000 for miscellaneous expenses.


	These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into
	an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.


	We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination.


	Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In the current economic environment, it has become especially difficult to obtain acquisition financing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In
	addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.


	Controls and Procedures


	We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions

	from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.


	Prior to the closing of this offering, we have not completed an assessment, nor have our auditors tested our systems, of internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Many small and mid-sized target businesses we may
	consider for our business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as:






	


	staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties;








	


	reconciliation of accounts;








	


	proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate;








	


	evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions;








	


	documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and








	


	documentation of accounting policies and procedures.




	Because it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting.


	Once our managements report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by Section 404. The independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning a target businesss internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.


	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk


	The net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.




	Related Party Transactions


	In November 2015, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. In December 2015 and February and March 2016, our sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,972,500 founder shares, which we cancelled. To the extent the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised, our sponsor will forfeit up to 300,000 founder shares so that its remaining founder shares would represent 20.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of this offering (assuming it does not purchase any units in this offering). The purchase
	price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In January 2016, our sponsor transferred 150,000 shares to Ms. Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, 50,000 shares to Mr. Dow, our Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and 10,000 shares each to Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, our director nominees. In March 2016, Mr. Dow and Ms. Thom returned to us, at no cost, 10,000 and 30,000 founder shares, respectively, which we cancelled. If we increase or decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or a share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable with respect to our Class F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of founder shares by our initial stockholders prior to this offering at

	20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering).


	KLR Group Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, has agreed to provide, at no cost to us, office space and general administrative services.


	Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of this offering. We will also reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for certain expenses to be incurred in connection with our employment of Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, including employment related taxes (to be paid in connection with Ms. Thoms annual salary) and health benefits.


	Our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
	persons in connection with activities on our behalf provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.


	Our sponsor has loaned or agreed to loan us up to $275,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the closing of our initial business combination.


	In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to
	$1,500,000 of such loans (including any loans described above) may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present
	conflicts of interest. KLR Group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as KLR Group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor. As a consequence, we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required.


	Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 (or 8,950,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) EBC warrants will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), at a price of $0.75 per warrant ($6,232,500 in the aggregate or $6,712,500 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in
	full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. Our sponsor will be permitted to transfer the private placement warrants held by them to certain permitted transferees, including



	65



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	our executive officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to them, but the transferees receiving such securities will be subject to the same agreements with respect to such securities as our sponsor. Otherwise, these warrants will not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our business combination. The private placement warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees (except as described below under Principal Stockholders  Transfers of Founder
	Shares and Private Placement Warrants). The private placement warrants may also be exercised by the initial holders or their permitted transferees for cash or on a cashless basis. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital has agreed that it (and/or its designees) will not be permitted to exercise any EBC warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.


	Pursuant to a registration rights agreement we will enter into with our initial stockholders and the initial purchasers of the private placement warrants on or prior to the closing of this offering, we may be required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders are entitled under the registration rights agreement to make up to three demands that we register certain of our securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include
	their securities in other registration statements filed by us. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.


	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results


	As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus as we have conducted no operations to date.


	JOBS Act


	On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for
	non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.


	Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditors attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
	Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

	PROPOSED BUSINESS


	General


	We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any business combination targets and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.


	While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on the sector that complements our management teams expertise in the exploration, exploitation, operation and development of crude oil and natural gas wells and related infrastructure, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to source, screen, evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and manage acquisitions of attractive assets or businesses in the U.S. In the event that we find an acquisition opportunity in a different sector, or in a different geographic region, that is more compelling than the
	opportunities presented to us in to the U.S. oil and gas industry, we would pursue the opportunity in such other sector or such other geographic region. However, we have not established any particular parameters or criteria as to when we might turn our attention to opportunities outside of the U.S. oil and gas industry. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $400 million to $1 billion.


	Business Opportunity Overview


	Our strategy is to source, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build, an E&P business. E&P companies focus on finding, producing and marketing various forms of crude oil and natural gas. We believe that there is a unique and timely opportunity to achieve attractive returns by acquiring and developing E&P assets in proven basins with known operational and limited geologic risks. We believe this opportunity exists due to several key factors: (i) the recent decline of commodity prices had an immediate and meaningful impact on the cash flows of E&P companies, creating a need for many E&P firms
	to issue external capital or sell assets, (ii) the recent decline of commodity prices has substantially reduced E&P asset valuations and is moderating drilling and completion costs, and operating costs, resulting in a lower cost to acquire and develop, (iii) the short-term volatility and cyclical nature of commodity prices underpinned by a positive long-term outlook for crude oil and natural gas demand and the need for higher commodity prices to meet expected demand growth and (iv) the advantages enjoyed by E&P companies operating in the U.S., including access to industry-leading technologies and expertise, top-tier oil and gas-producing basins, established infrastructure and favorable political policies relative to other regions.


	Competitive Strengths


	Our Executive Officers.


	We believe our management team is in a prime position to take advantage of opportunities within oil and gas and to create value for our stockholders. Our management team has a long history in oil and gas, with a deep knowledge of the industry and a well-established network of relationships with public and private oil and gas companies, equity sponsors, lending institutions, family offices, attorneys and brokers, from which we expect to generate attractive acquisition opportunities.

	strategy and implementation, which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.



	Our Network of Relationships and Third Party Advisors.

	  We intend to utilize what our management believes is an accomplished and proven network of relationships and third party advisors to assist with target company origination and evaluation, due diligence and implementation of value creation programs and activities following our initial business combination. We believe this combination of resources is unique and provides us with a truly differentiated value proposition for investors, sellers, target companies and their management teams.


	Status as a Public Company


	We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we
	believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.


	Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in
	attracting talented employees.


	We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30

	th

	, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior
	three-year period.


	Financial Position


	With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $83,200,000 assuming no redemptions (or $95,680,000 assuming no redemptions if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full), and except for up to $300,000 we may have to pay in deferred underwriting commissions in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are
	able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

	Conflicts of Interest


	An affiliate of ours, KLR Group, is a registered broker-dealer operating in the oil and gas sector. KLR Group undertakes a wide range of financial advisory, merchant and investment banking, research and sales and trading activities for a wide variety of clients, including public and private companies in the oil and gas sector. Accordingly, there may be situations in which KLR Group has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain investment opportunities or may be otherwise disadvantaged in
	some situations by our relationship to KLR Group.


	KLR Group is regulated by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. KLR Groups merchant banking business generally targets transactions of a similar size as those that would be suitable for our initial business combination, and thus may compete with us for one or more potential targets. Further, other investors in affiliates of ours and KLR Groups may be in direct competition with us for a possible target for our initial business combination. KLR Group may also choose to operate, or have an interest in, investment entities similar to us or that otherwise compete with us in the future.


	Other clients of KLR Groups advisory business may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our investment objectives. If KLR Group is engaged to act for any such clients, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within KLR Group, including by Mr. Kovalik and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for both us and for an investment banking client or a current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicle, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, and may be directed to such client or
	investment vehicle rather than to us. KLR Groups advisory business may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company, business or assets that would qualify as an investment opportunity for us. In such cases, we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the company, business or assets. If we are permitted to pursue the opportunity, KLR Groups interests or its obligations to the seller will diverge from our interests. Neither KLR Group nor members of our management who are also employed by KLR Group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless such opportunity was expressly offered in writing to our management solely in their capacity as officers or directors of the company. KLR Group and/or our management, in their capacities as officers of KLR Group or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities
	described above, current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicles, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, or third parties, including clients of KLR Group, before they present such opportunities to us. In addition, our President, Edward Kovalik, is a director of River Bend Oil & Gas, LLC, a private company operating in the oil and gas sector, and our other executive officers are affiliated either with KLR Group or with other companies in the oil and gas industry. In addition, our independent directors (expected to be appointed just prior to the consummation of our public offering) may have pre-existing duties or obligations that prevent them from presenting otherwise suitable target businesses to us. Our independent directors will be under no obligation to present opportunities of which they become aware to the company unless such opportunity was expressly offered to the independent director solely in his capacity as a director of the
	company.


	Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business or businesses with significant growth potential on favorable terms.


	If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to a business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.


	Mr. Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer, is currently restricted by a non-compete provision contained in his consulting agreement with Energy XXI, which provision is in effect until June 3, 2016. Such provision prohibits Mr. Hanna from acquiring or managing certain businesses in the shallow Gulf of Mexico that broadly compete with the business activities of Energy XXI. In light of the non-competition agreement, we

	will not seek an initial business combination with any company operating in the businesses described above, unless such transaction were to close subsequent to the expiration of the non-competition provision. Any litigation associated with the non-competition agreement could be time consuming, costly and distract management's focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business.


	None of the members of our management team, the sponsor, KLR Group or KLR Holdings has previous experience as sponsor or in a management capacity with other blank check companies.


	Effecting our Initial Business Combination


	General


	We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks
	inherent in such companies and businesses.


	If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the
	purchase of other companies, to pay up to $300,000 in deferred underwriting commissions in the event that the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option or for working capital.


	We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions with respect to identifying any business combination target. From the period commencing with our formation through the date of this prospectus, there have been no communications or discussions between any of our officers, directors or our sponsor and any of their potential contacts or relationships regarding a potential initial business combination. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to
	conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.


	We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the
	business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

	prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.


	Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination


	The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses.
	If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.


	In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. There is no basis for investors
	in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.


	To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.


	The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present
	conflicts of interest. KLR Group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as KLR Group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor. As a consequence, we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required.


	Lack of business diversification


	For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:



	72



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS







	


	subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and








	


	cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.




	Limited ability to evaluate the targets management team


	Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with
	us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.


	We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.


	Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.


	Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination


	We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

	


	any of our directors, executive officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or

	the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.

	Permitted purchases of our securities


	In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be
	used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to,
	the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.


	In the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such
	purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.


	The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.


	In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, executive officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders
	who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.


	Any purchases by our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would
	violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

	Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination


	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately
	$10.40 per public share. Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.


	Manner of Conducting Redemptions


	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek
	stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.


	If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:






	


	conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and








	


	file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.




	Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.


	In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to
	be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.


	If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:



	75



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS







	


	conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and








	


	file proxy materials with the SEC.




	In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.


	If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. The founder shares held by our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares
	and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination, and our executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer. In addition, our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its
	owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.


	Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights


	We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our
	initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.


	There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

	The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to
	verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.


	Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing
	to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.


	If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.


	If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 18 months from the closing of this offering.


	Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we will have only 18 months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes
	payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 18-month time period.


	Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders (or any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within
	the allotted 18-month time period.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of

	incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon
	the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules).


	We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $725,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (including up to $275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.


	If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.40. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.40. Under
	Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims.


	Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the
	enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no
	guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mr. Kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of
	any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Kovalik



	78



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other executive officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.


	In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and Mr. Kovalik asserts that he is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal
	action against Mr. Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.40 per share.


	We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Kovalik will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Kovalik will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $725,000 (including up to
	$275,000 of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering, which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination) from the proceeds of this offering with which to pay any such potential claims (not including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $582,500, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $582,500,
	the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.


	Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it,
	including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.


	Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our
	business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes),



	79



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to
	redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18

	th

	month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.


	Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above,
	pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.


	As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of
	interest withdrawn to pay income taxes, and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.


	If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.40 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any
	distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.


	Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will
	not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

	Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us,
	pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that:






	


	prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;








	


	we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;








	


	if our initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months from the closing of this offering, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and








	


	prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.




	These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.

	Redemptions if we fail to

	Calculation of redemption price



	 


	Redemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. In either case, our public stockholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination (which is initially anticipated to be $10.40 per share), including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination and any limitations (including
	but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination.



	 


	If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following completion of our initial business combination. Such purchases will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions.



	 


	If we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.40 per share), including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.




	Impact to remaining stockholders



	 


	The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining stockholders, who will bear the burden of the interest withdrawn in order to pay income taxes (to the extent not paid from amounts accrued as interest on the funds held in the trust account).



	 


	If the permitted purchases described above are made, there will be no impact to our remaining stockholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us.



	 


	The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial stockholder, who will be our only remaining stockholder after such redemptions.

	Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419


	The following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of an offering by a blank check company subject to the provisions of Rule 419. This comparison assumes that the gross proceeds, underwriting commissions and underwriting expenses of our offering would be identical to those of an offering undertaken by a company subject to Rule 419, and that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option. None of the provisions of Rule 419 apply to our offering.













	 






	 










	 


	Terms of Our Offering



	 


	Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering




	Escrow of offering proceeds



	 


	The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. $83,200,000 of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be deposited into a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.



	 


	Approximately $70,200,000 of the offering proceeds, representing the gross proceeds of this offering less allowable underwriting commissions, expenses and company deductions under Rule 419, would be required to be deposited into either an escrow account with an insured depositary institution or in a separate bank account established by a broker-dealer in which the broker-dealer acts as trustee for persons having the beneficial interests in the account.




	Investment of net proceeds



	 


	$83,200,000 of the net offering proceeds and the sale of the private placement warrants held in trust will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.



	 


	Proceeds could be invested only in specified securities such as a money market fund meeting conditions of the Investment Company Act or in securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.

	Receipt of interest on escrowed funds



	 


	Interest on proceeds from the trust account to be paid to stockholders is reduced by any taxes paid or payable.



	 


	Interest on funds in escrow account would be held for the sole benefit of investors, unless and only after the funds held in escrow were released to us in connection with our completion of a business combination.




	Limitation on fair value or net assets of target business



	 


	The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination.



	 


	The fair value or net assets of a target business must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds.




	Trading of securities issued



	 


	The units will begin trading promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 90

	th

	day following the date of this prospectus unless EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering, which is anticipated to take place three business days from the date of this prospectus. If the over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the over-allotment option.



	 


	No trading of the units or the underlying common stock and warrants would be permitted until the completion of a business combination. During this period, the securities would be held in the escrow or trust account.

	Exercise of the warrants



	 


	The warrants cannot be exercised until the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination or 12 months from the closing of this offering.



	 


	The warrants could be exercised prior to the completion of a business combination, but securities received and cash paid in connection with the exercise would be deposited in the escrow or trust account.




	Election to remain an investor



	 


	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest, which interest shall be net of income taxes payable, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. We may not be required by law to hold a stockholder vote. If we are not required by law and do not otherwise decide to hold a stockholder vote, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required
	under the SECs proxy rules. If, however, we hold a stockholder vote, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Additionally, public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer.



	 


	A prospectus containing information pertaining to the business combination required by the SEC would be sent to each investor. Each investor would be given the opportunity to notify the company in writing, within a period of no less than 20 business days and no more than 45 business days from the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the companys registration statement, to decide if he, she or it elects to remain a stockholder of the company or require the return of his, her or its investment. If the company has not received the notification by the end of the 45

	th

	business day, funds and interest or dividends, if any, held in the trust or escrow account are automatically returned to the stockholder. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all funds on deposit in the escrow account must be returned to all of the investors and none of the securities are issued.

	Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering




	Business combination deadline



	 


	If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of
	clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



	 


	If an acquisition has not been completed within 18 months after the effective date of the companys registration statement, funds held in the trust or escrow account are returned to investors.




	Release of funds



	 


	Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes, none of the funds held in trust (including the interest on such funds) will be released from the trust account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within the required time frame (subject to the requirements of applicable law).



	 


	The proceeds held in the escrow account are not released until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the failure to effect a business combination within the allotted time.

	Terms of Our Offering



	 


	Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering




	Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights



	 


	We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we
	send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights.



	 


	In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, holders could vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holders were seeking to exercise their redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholders to arrange for them to deliver their certificate to verify ownership.



	 


	  








	Competition


	In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Currently, we believe there are approximately 26 publicly-traded blank check companies that have raised an aggregate of approximately $5 billion in gross proceeds that may be our competitors, although we are only aware of one other of these companies that has an oil and gas sector focus. Many of
	these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.


	Facilities


	We currently maintain our executive offices at 811 Main Street, 18

	th

	Floor, Houston, TX 77002. KLR Group Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, has agreed to provide, at no cost to us, office space and general administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS





	Employees


	We currently have four executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.


	Periodic Reporting and Financial Information


	We will register our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.


	We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent
	that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.


	We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.


	Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our business combination.


	We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a
	non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Coordinator for the Rockies Region and as Regional Engineer for the Northern Business Unit during three years with Meridian Oil Company from 1993 to 1996. Mr. York began his career with ARCO Oil and Gas Company in 1983 where his roles included Drilling Engineering, Reservoir Engineering and Planning and Evaluation. Mr. York holds a B.S. Degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Tulsa.

	Number and Terms of Office of Executive Officers and Directors


	Our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Hanna and Kovalik, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. We do not currently intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we
	consummate our initial business combination.


	Our executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our executive officers may consist of a Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.


	Director Independence


	NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the companys board of directors, would interfere with the directors exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We will have three independent directors, Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our
	independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.




	Executive Officer and Director Compensation


	None of our executive officers, directors or director nominees have received any cash (or non-cash) compensation for services rendered to us. Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of this offering. We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for certain expenses to be incurred in connection with our employment of Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, including employment related taxes (to be paid in connection with Ms. Thoms annual salary) and health benefits. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of
	their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our independent directors will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers, directors or our or their affiliates.


	After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive and director compensation. Any
	compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our managements motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain
	with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.


	Committees of the Board of Directors


	Upon the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our board of directors will have two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Our audit committee will be composed of three independent directors and our compensation committee will be composed solely of independent directors.


	Audit Committee


	Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York will serve as members of our audit committee. Mr. Buckner will serve as chairman of the audit committee. Under the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee. The rules of NASDAQ and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. All members named in this committee are independent.


	Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Buckner qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules.


	Responsibilities of the audit committee include:






	


	the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;








	


	pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;








	


	reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;








	


	setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors;








	


	setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;








	


	obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent auditors describing (i) the independent auditors internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within, the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;








	


	reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and








	


	reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Compensation Committee


	Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a compensation committee of the board of directors. The members of our Compensation Committee will be Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York. Mr. Abbas will serve as chairman of the compensation committee. We will adopt a compensation committee charter, which will detail the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:






	


	reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officers based on such evaluation;








	


	reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;








	


	reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;








	


	implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;








	


	assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;








	


	approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;








	


	producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and








	


	reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.




	The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by NASDAQ and the SEC.


	Director Nominations


	We do not have a standing nominating committee, though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or NASDAQ rules. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the NASDAQ rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who shall participate in the consideration and
	recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(1)(A) of the NASDAQ rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.


	The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to the Board should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.


	We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders.

	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation


	None of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors.


	Code of Ethics


	Prior to the effectiveness of this registration statement, we will have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, executive officers and employees. We will file a copy of our form of Code of Ethics and our audit committee charter as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SECs web site at

	www.sec.gov

	. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of
	Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. See Where You Can Find Additional Information.


	Conflicts of Interest


	KLR Group undertakes a wide range of financial advisory, merchant and investment banking, research and sales and trading activities for a wide variety of clients, including public and private companies in the oil and gas sector. Accordingly, there may be situations in which KLR Group has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain investment opportunities or may be otherwise disadvantaged in some situations by our relationship to KLR Group.


	Some of these potential conflicts are described below. In considering them, you should understand that:






	


	Mr. Kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for the company are not independent from KLR Group, have other responsibilities (including investment banking responsibilities) within KLR Group and may have an economic interest in the success of KLR Group separate and apart from their economic interest in the company. Mr. Kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for our business will concurrently work for and receive compensation relating to investment banking or other activities at KLR Group. While their equity interests in the company may incentivize them to benefit the company, the compensation from investment banking or other KLR Group activities may incentivize them to serve the interests of KLR Groups investment banking business and its clients, or other KLR Group businesses.








	


	Conflicts related to the allocation of potential business opportunities to us will be considered and resolved on a case by case and discretionary basis by KLR Group, including Mr. Kovalik. While this process will consider the companys interests, investors should assume that conflicts will be resolved in a manner determined to be in the overall best interests of KLR Group including its various businesses and relationships. Accordingly, investors should be aware that conflicts will not necessarily be resolved in our favor of the companys interests.








	


	Gary C. Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer, is a party to a consulting agreement with Energy XXI, which contains a non-competition provision. This agreement is referred to as the non-competition agreement. Until June 3, 2016, Mr. Hanna generally will be restricted from acquiring or managing certain businesses in the shallow Gulf of Mexico that broadly compete with the business activities of Energy XXI. In light of the non-competition agreement, we will not seek an initial business combination with any company operating in the businesses described above, unless such transaction were to close subsequent to the expiration of the non-competition provision. Any litigation associated with the non-competition agreement could be time consuming, costly and distract management's focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business.








	


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the

	TABLE OF CONTENTS









	audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. KLR Group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as KLR Group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor. As a consequence, we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required.




	Without limiting the foregoing, the following describes some of the potential conflicts that could arise:


	General






	


	The founder shares and private placement warrants owned by our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees will be released from the lock-up only if a business combination is successfully completed, and the warrants held by our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees, including the private placement warrants and any warrants which they may purchase in this offering or in the open market, will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated. Additionally, the holders of founder shares will not receive liquidation distributions with respect to any of their founder shares. Furthermore, our sponsor has agreed that the private placement warrants will not be sold or transferred by them until 30 days after we have completed a business combination. For the foregoing reasons, our board may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate to effect a
	business combination with.








	


	Our sponsor and our executive officers, directors and director nominees may purchase shares of common stock as part of this offering or in the open market. If they do, they have agreed to vote such shares in favor of our initial business combination.








	


	KLR Group has no fiduciary obligations to us. Therefore, it has no obligation to present business opportunities to us at all and will only do so if it believes it will not violate its other fiduciary obligations.




	Advisory Activities






	


	KLR Group currently operates a merchant banking business that could compete with us for acquisition targets. KLR Group may also choose to operate, or have an interest in, investment entities similar to us or that otherwise compete with us in the future. Neither KLR Group nor members of our management who are also employed by KLR Group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless such opportunity was expressly offered in writing to our management solely in their capacity as officers or directors of the company. KLR Group and/or our management, in their capacities as officers of KLR Group or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicles, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, or third parties, including
	clients of KLR Group, before they present such opportunities to us. In addition, the independent directors that we appoint may have pre-existing duties or obligations that prevent them from presenting otherwise suitable target businesses to us. Our independent directors will be under no obligation to present opportunities of which they become aware to the company unless such opportunity was expressly offered to the independent director solely in his capacity as a director of the company.








	


	Other clients of KLR Groups advisory business may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our investment objectives. If KLR Group is engaged to act for any such clients, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities.








	


	Investment ideas generated within KLR Group, including by Mr. Kovalik and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for us and for an investment banking client or a current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicle, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, and may be directed to such client or investment vehicle rather than to us.

	KLR Groups advisory business may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company or of assets that would qualify as an investment opportunity for the company. In such cases, we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the business or assets. If we are permitted to pursue the opportunity, KLR Groups interests or its obligations to the seller will diverge from our interests.




	Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our executive officers, directors and director nominees may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting our investment criteria to multiple entities. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise when our board evaluates a particular business opportunity with respect to our investment criteria. The above mentioned conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a
	public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business or businesses with significant growth potential on favorable terms.


	We have agreed not to consummate a business combination with an entity which is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors unless we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view and any such transaction must be approved by a majority of our directors who do not have an interest in such a transaction and our audit committee, which will be comprised of independent directors. We currently do not anticipate entering into a business combination with an entity affiliated with our sponsor, executive
	officers or directors.


	Certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such executive officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of the above executive officers, directors or director nominees becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
	such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.


	Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees may become involved with subsequent blank check companies similar to our company, although they have agreed not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 18 months after the closing of this offering. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:






	


	None of our executive officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.








	


	In the course of their other business activities, our executive officers, directors and director nominees may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented to our company or to another entity. For a complete description of our managements other affiliations, see  Directors and Executive Officers.

	Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months after the closing of this offering. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of their founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business
	combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the private placement warrants and the common stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion
	of our initial business combination. Since our sponsor, its members and our executive officers, directors and director nominees may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following this offering, our sponsor, its members and executive officers, directors and director nominees may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.








	


	Our executive officers, directors and director nominees may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such executive officers, directors and director nominees was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.




	The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.


	In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:






	


	the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;








	


	the opportunity is within the corporations line of business; and








	


	it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.




	Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our executive officers, directors and director nominees may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our executive officers or directors in circumstances where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have.

	Accordingly, if any of the above executive officers, directors or director nominees becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.


	We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.


	In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 3,000,001 of the 8,000,000 public shares, or 37.5%, sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to
	have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised) and no shares are purchased by such parties in this offering).

	Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Executive Officers and Directors


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our executive officers, directors and director nominees will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.


	We will enter into agreements with our executive officers, directors and director nominees to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any executive officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our executive officers, directors and director nominees against the cost
	of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our executive officers, directors and director nominees.


	These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against executive officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against executive officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.


	We believe that these provisions and the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.

	PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS


	The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of the date of this prospectus, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our common stock included in the units offered by this prospectus, and assuming no purchase of units in this offering, by:






	


	each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;








	


	each of our executive officers, directors and director nominees that beneficially owns shares of our common stock; and








	


	all our executive officers and directors as a group.




	Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus.


	The post-offering ownership percentage column below, as well as the footnotes denoting pecuniary interest below, assume that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, that our sponsor forfeits 300,000 founder shares, and that there are 10,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding after this offering.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Immediately after this offering, our initial stockholders will beneficially own 20.0% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. If we increase or decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or a share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders prior to this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering. Because
	of this ownership block, our initial stockholders may be able to effectively influence the outcome of all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions other than approval of our initial business combination.


	Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed, pursuant to written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 (or 8,950,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) EBC warrants will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), at a price of $0.75 per warrant ($6,232,500 in the aggregate or $6,712,500 in the aggregate if the over-allotment option is
	exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The purchase price of the private placement warrants will be added to the proceeds from this offering to be held in the trust account pending our completion of our business combination. If we do not complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants are subject to the transfer restrictions described below. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. If the private placement warrants are
	held by holders other than the initial holders or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering.


	Our sponsor and our executive officers and directors are deemed to be our promoters as such term is defined under the federal securities laws.


	Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants


	The founder shares, private placement warrants and any shares of Class A common stock issued upon exercise of the private placement warrants are each subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in the letter agreement with us to be entered into by our initial stockholders. Those lock-up provisions provide that such securities are not transferable or salable (i) in the case of the founder shares, subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of their founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier of (A) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination
	or (B) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property and (ii) in the case of the private placement warrants and the respective Class A common stock underlying such warrants, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except in each case (a) to our
	executive officers or directors, any affiliates or family members of any of our executive officers or directors, any members of our sponsor or any affiliates or family members of members of our sponsor, or any affiliates (or their employees) of our sponsor, (b) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of one of the members of the individuals immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of one of the individuals immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a

	charitable organization; (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased; (f) if a holder is an entity, as a distribution to its partners, shareholders or members upon its liquidation; (g) in the event of our liquidation prior to our completion of our initial business combination; or (h) by virtue of the
	laws of Delaware or our sponsors limited liability company agreement upon dissolution of our sponsor; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (f) and (h) these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions.


	Registration Rights


	The holders of the founder shares and private placement warrants will have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering. These holders will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have piggy-back registration rights to include such securities in other registration statements filed by us and rights to require us to register
	for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. EarlyBirdCapital may not exercise its demand and piggy-back registration rights after five (5) and seven (7) years after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and may not exercise its demand rights on more than one occasion. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	In November 2015, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. In December 2015 and February and March 2016, our sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,972,500 founder shares, which we cancelled. Our sponsor will forfeit up to 300,000 founder shares to the extent the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised, so that our initial stockholders founder shares represent 20.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of this offering. In January 2016, our sponsor transferred 150,000 shares to Ms.
	Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, 50,000 shares to Mr. Dow, our Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and 10,000 shares to Messrs. Abbas, Buckner and York, our director nominees. In March 2016, Mr. Dow and Ms. Thom returned to us, at no cost, 10,000 and 30,000 founder shares, respectively, which we cancelled. If we increase or decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders prior to this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering.


	Our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees) have committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 8,310,000 (or 8,950,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, among which 7,776,667 (or 8,336,667 if the overallotment is exercised in full) insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and 533,333 (or 613,333 if the overallotment is exercised in full) EBC warrants will be purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and/or its designees), for a purchase price of $0.75 per warrant in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this
	offering. Our sponsor will purchase these warrants. As such, our sponsors interest in this transaction is valued at between $5,832,500 and $6,252,500, depending on the number of private placement warrants purchased. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by it until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The sponsor will fund its warrant purchase commitment with funds provided by certain of its members (Reid S. Buerger, the Alan H. Buerger 2003 Trust for Reid S. Buerger and the 2012 Buerger Family SD LLC) which have a pecuniary interest in the securities held by the sponsor. Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital has agreed that it and/or its designees will not be permitted to
	exercise any EBC warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.


	As more fully discussed in Management  Conflicts of Interest, if any of our executive officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our executive officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.


	KLR Group Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, has agreed to provide, at no cost to us, office space and general administrative services.


	Pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and Ms. Thom, we will pay Ms. Thom a salary of $200,000 annually following the consummation of this offering. We will also reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for certain expenses to be incurred in connection with our employment of Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, including employment related taxes (to be paid in connection with Ms. Thoms annual salary) and health benefits. Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom have agreed, pursuant to their employment agreements, (i) to maintain in strictest confidence any confidential information they receive relating to actual or potential
	businesses of ours or our affiliates, (ii) not to solicit employees of ours or our affiliates for one year following termination of employment by Mr. Hanna or Ms. Thom, respectively and (iii) not to solicit any business from any client of ours or an affiliate of ours for six months following the resignation or termination for cause of Mr. Hanna or Ms. Thom, respectively, or three months with respect to a prospective client.

	Our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
	persons in connection with activities on our behalf.


	Our sponsor has loaned or will loan us up to $275,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the closing of our initial business combination. The value of our sponsors interest in this transaction corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan.


	In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers, directors and director nominees may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000
	of such loans (including any loans described above) may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.


	In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts
	of interest. KLR Group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as KLR Group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor. As a consequence, we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required.


	After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the
	post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.


	We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares and private placement warrants, which is described under the heading Principal Stockholders  Registration Rights.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES


	Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value, 6,000,000 shares of Class F common stock, $0.0001 par value and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, $0.0001 par value. The following description summarizes the material terms of our capital stock. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.


	Units


	Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. The Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 90

	th

	day following the closing of this offering unless EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press
	release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the shares of Class A common stock and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Class A common stock and warrants.


	In no event will the Class A common stock and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering which will include this audited balance sheet, which is anticipated to take place three business days after the date of this prospectus. If the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current
	Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option.


	Common Stock


	Immediately prior to pricing our offering, there were 2,300,000 shares of our Class F common stock outstanding. Our initial stockholders will own 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Upon the closing of this offering, 10,000,000 shares of our common stock will be outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option and the corresponding forfeiture of 300,000 founder shares by our sponsor), including:






	


	8,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock underlying the units being offered in this offering; and








	


	2,000,000 shares of our class F common stock held by our initial stockholders.




	If we increase or decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of founder shares by our initial stockholders prior to this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering.


	Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of the Class F common stock and holders of the Class A common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders except as required by law. Unless specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or as required by applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our common shares that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders. Our
	board of directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Because our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of shares of common stock which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our stockholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination.


	In accordance with NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on NASDAQ. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the
	DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.


	We will provide our Class A stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.40 per public
	share. Our initial stockholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our business combination. Unlike many blank check companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination.
	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SECs proxy rules. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. However, the participation of our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result
	in the approval of our business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our business combination.


	If we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination, and our executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Additionally, public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public
	shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholders (or any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or after this
	offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time period.


	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our stockholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Our stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock, except that we will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount
	then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein.


	Founder Shares


	The founder shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units being sold in this offering, and holders of founder shares have the same stockholder rights as public stockholders, except that (i) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, (ii) our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (A) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our business combination and (B) to waive their rights to liquidating
	distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, although our initial stockholders (or any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares acquired if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time period and (iii) the founder shares are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described herein. If we submit our business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive
	officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 3,000,001 of the 8,000,000 public shares, or 37.5%, sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and no shares are purchased by such parties in this offering). Permitted transferees of our sponsor will be subject to the same obligations of our sponsor.


	The shares of Class F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the business combination, the ratio at which shares of Class F common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common



	108



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	stock will be adjusted so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class F common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of this offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination or pursuant to warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans,
	after taking into account any shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination.


	Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of their founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date
	of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.


	Preferred Stock


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the
	common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preferred stock outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in this offering.


	Warrants


	Public Stockholders Warrants


	Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of this offering or 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.


	We will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance
	of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A common stock underlying such unit.


	We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days, after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the



	109



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective no later than 90 days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective
	within 90 days following the consummation of our initial business combination, public warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise.
	If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.


	Once the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption:






	


	in whole and not in part;








	


	at a price of $0.01 per warrant;








	


	upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period) to each warrant holder; and








	


	if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.




	We have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A common stock may fall below the $21.00 redemption trigger price as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.


	If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, all
	holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Class A common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will
	reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.


	A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such persons affiliates), to the warrant agents actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.


	If the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Class A common stock, or by a split-up of shares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Class A common stock. A rights offering to holders of Class A common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a price less than the fair market value will
	be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock) multiplied by (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Class A common stock paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock, in determining the price payable for Class A common stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of Class A common stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the
	first date on which the shares of Class A common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.


	In addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of Class A common stock on account of such shares of Class A common stock (or other shares of our capital stock into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A common stock in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) as a result of the repurchase of shares of Class A common stock by the company if the proposed
	initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Class A common stock in respect of such event.


	If the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Class A common stock.


	Whenever the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of Class A common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.


	In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Class A common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any

	reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of our Class A common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares
	of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption rights held by
	stockholders of the company as provided for in the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation or as a result of the repurchase of shares of Class A common stock by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, the holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such
	holder would actually have been entitled as a stockholder if such warrant holder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Class A common stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement. Additionally, if less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class A common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the per share consideration minus Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant.


	The warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then
	outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants.


	The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Class A common stock.
	After the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to the warrant holder.


	Private Placement Warrants


	The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of our initial business combination (except, among other limited exceptions as described under Principal Stockholders  Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants) and they will not be redeemable by us and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and
	provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial holders or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering.


	If holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading
	days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the shares of Class A common stock received upon such exercise freely in
	the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.


	Dividends


	We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the
	foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, in which case we will effect a stock dividend with respect to our Class F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of founder shares by our initial stockholders prior to this offering at 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.




	Our Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent


	The transfer agent for our common stock and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents and each of its stockholders, directors, officers and employees against all liabilities, including judgments, costs and reasonable counsel fees that may arise out of

	acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any liability due to any gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the indemnified person or entity.


	Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least 65% of our common stock, and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account. Our initial stockholders, who will beneficially own 20.0% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote
	to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that:






	


	if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and
	liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;








	


	prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination;








	


	although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our management team or their affiliates, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an investment banking firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;








	


	if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;








	


	Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;








	


	If our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares; and








	


	we will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.





	114



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination.


	Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws


	We will be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers upon completion of this offering. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a business combination with:






	


	a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an interested stockholder);








	


	an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or








	


	an associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.




	A business combination includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 do not apply if:






	


	our board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested stockholder, prior to the date of the transaction;








	


	after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or








	


	on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.




	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our board of directors will be classified into two classes of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings.


	Our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.


	Special Meeting of Stockholders


	Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our board of directors, by our CEO or by our chairman.


	Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations


	Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their intent in writing. To be timely, a stockholders notice will need to be received by the secretary to our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90

	th

	day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120

	th

	day prior to the scheduled date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, proposals seeking
	inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply with the notice periods contained therein. Our bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders meeting. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders.

	Securities Eligible for Future Sale


	Immediately after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) we will have 10,000,000 (or 11,500,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 8,000,000 shares (or 9,200,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the remaining 2,000,000 (or 2,300,000
	if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) shares and all 8,310,000 (or 8,950,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants are restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering, and are subject to transfer restrictions as set forth elsewhere in this prospectus.


	Rule 144


	Pursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale.


	Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of:






	


	1% of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal 100,000 shares immediately after this offering (or 115,000 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full); or








	


	the average weekly reported trading volume of the common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.




	Sales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.


	Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies


	Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:






	


	the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;








	


	the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;








	


	the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and








	


	at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.




	As a result, our initial stockholders will be able to sell their founder shares and private placement warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination.

	Registration Rights


	The holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to our Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make
	up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.


	Listing of Securities


	Our units, Class A common stock and warrants have been approved for listing on NASDAQ under the symbols KLREU, KLRE and KLREW, respectively. We expect that our units will be listed on NASDAQ promptly after the effective date of the registration statement. Following the date the shares of our Class A common stock and warrants are eligible to trade separately, we anticipate that the shares of our Class A common stock and warrants will be listed separately and as a unit on NASDAQ. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on NASDAQ.

	CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS


	The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants, which we refer to collectively as our securities. Because the components of a unit are separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying Class A common stock and warrant components of the unit, as the case may be. As a result, the discussion below with respect to actual holders of Class A common stock and warrants should also apply to
	holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying Class A common stock and warrants that comprise the units). This discussion applies only to securities that are held as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is applicable only to holders who purchased units in this offering.


	This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain investment income and the different consequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules that apply to certain types of investors, such as:






	


	financial institutions;








	


	insurance companies;








	


	dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to the securities;








	


	persons holding the securities as part of a straddle, hedge, integrated transaction or similar transaction;








	


	U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;








	


	partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and








	


	tax-exempt entities.




	If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities.


	This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this prospectus may affect the tax consequences described herein. This discussion does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxation, or any U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (such as gift and estate taxes).


	You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction.


	Personal Holding Company Status


	We could be subject to a second level of U.S. federal income tax on a portion of our income if we are determined to be a personal holding company, or PHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a PHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if (i) at any time during the last half of such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds and charitable trusts) own or are deemed to own (pursuant to
	certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the stock of the corporation by value and (ii) at least 60% of the corporations adjusted ordinary gross income, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for such taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents).


	Depending on the date and size of our initial business combination, at least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross income may consist of PHC income as discussed above. In addition, depending on the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals, including the members of our sponsor and certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds and charitable trusts, more than 50% of our stock may be owned or deemed



	118



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	owned (pursuant to the constructive ownership rules) by such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given that we will not become a PHC following this offering or in the future. If we are or were to become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed PHC income, which generally includes our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. We believe that both of the PHC requirements will apply to us in the taxable year of the offering and that it is possible that the PHC requirements will apply to us in future taxable years.


	Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit


	No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our Class A common stock and one warrant to acquire one share of our Class A common stock. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must
	allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one share of Class A common stock and the warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each share of Class A common stock and the warrant should be the stockholders tax basis in such share or warrant, as the case may be. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of Class A common stock and one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class A common stock and warrant based on their respective relative fair market values. The separation of the share of Class A common stock and the warrant comprising a unit should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	The foregoing treatment of the shares of Class A common stock and warrants and a holders purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the
	characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	U.S. Holders


	This section applies to you if you are a U.S. holder. A U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of our units, shares of Class A common stock or warrants who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:






	


	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;








	


	a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or








	


	an estate or trust the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.





	Taxation of Distributions.

	  If we pay cash distributions to U.S. holders of shares of our Class A common stock, such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in our Class A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain
	realized on the sale or other disposition of the Class A common stock and will be treated as described under  Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock below.


	Dividends we pay to a U.S. holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to a non-corporate U.S. holder generally will constitute qualified dividends that will be subject to tax at the maximum tax rate accorded to

	long-term capital gains. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Class A common stock described in this prospectus may prevent a U.S. holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be.



	Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock and Warrants.

	  Upon a sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A common stock or warrants which, in general, would include a redemption of Class A common stock or warrants as described below, and including as a result of a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required time period, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. holders adjusted tax
	basis in the Class A common stock or warrants. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holders holding period for the Class A common stock or warrants so disposed of exceeds one year. It is unclear, however, whether the redemption rights with respect to the Class A common stock described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.


	Generally, the amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder is an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition (or, if the Class A common stock or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the Class A common stock or the warrants based upon the then fair market values of the Class A common stock and the warrants included in the units) and (ii) the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its Class A common stock or warrants
	so disposed of. A U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its Class A common stock or warrants generally will equal the U.S. holders acquisition cost (that is, as discussed above, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of Class A common stock or warrant or, as discussed below, the U.S. holders initial basis for Class A common stock received upon exercise of warrants) less, in the case of a share of Class A common stock, any prior distributions treated as a return of capital.



	Redemption of Class A common stock.

	  In the event that a U.S. holders Class A common stock is redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under Description of Securities  Common Stock or if we purchase a U.S. holders Class A common stock in an open market transaction, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as sale of the Class A common stock under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of common stock, the U.S. holder will be treated as
	described under  Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Common Stock and Warrants above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of common stock, the U.S. holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under  Taxation of Distributions. Whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the U.S. holder (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. holder as a result of owning warrants) relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Class A common stock generally will be treated as a sale of the Class A common stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (i) is substantially disproportionate with respect to the U.S. holder, (ii) results in a complete termination
	of the U.S. holders interest in us or (iii) is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the U.S. holder. These tests are explained more fully below.


	In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, but also shares of our stock that are constructively owned by it. A U.S. holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. holder, as well as any stock the U.S. holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include Class A common stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants.
	In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately following the redemption of Class A common stock



	120



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	must, among other requirements, be less than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately before the redemption. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. holders interest if either (i) all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed or (ii) all of the shares of our stock actually owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed and the U.S. holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain family members and the U.S. holder does
	not constructively own any other stock. The redemption of the Class A common stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. holders conversion results in a meaningful reduction of the U.S. holders proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. holders proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a meaningful reduction. A U.S. holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption.


	If none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution and the tax effects will be as described under  Taxation of Distributions, above. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. holder in the redeemed Class A common stock will be added to the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its remaining stock, or, if it has none, to the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other stock constructively owned by it.



	Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant

	.  Except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. holder generally will not recognize taxable gain or loss the acquisition of common stock upon exercise of a warrant for cash. The U.S. holders tax basis in the share of our Class A common stock received upon exercise of the warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. holders initial investment in the warrant (i.e., the portion of the U.S. holders purchase price for a unit that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under   General
	Treatment of Units) and the exercise price. The U.S. holders holding period for the Class A common stock received upon exercise of the warrants will begin on the date following the date of exercise of the warrants and will not include the period during which the U.S. holder held the warrants. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holders tax basis in the warrant.


	The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-free, either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either tax-free situation, a U.S. holders basis in the Class A common stock received would equal the holders basis in the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a gain realization event, a U.S. holders holding period in the Class A common stock would be treated as commencing on the date following the date
	of exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Class A common stock would include the holding period of the warrant.


	It is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S. holder could be deemed to have surrendered warrants equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock having a value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Class A common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. holders tax basis in the warrants deemed surrendered. In this
	case, a U.S. holders tax basis in the Class A common stock received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the Class A common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. holders tax basis in the warrants exercised. A U.S. holders holding period for the Class A common stock would commence on the date following the date of exercise of the warrant.


	Due to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.

	Possible Constructive Distributions

	.  The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned Description of Securities   Warrants  Public Stockholders Warrants. An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the
	adjustment increases the warrant holders proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of shares of common stock that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of shares of our common stock which is taxable to the U.S. holders of such shares as described under  Taxation of Distributions above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

	.  In general, information reporting requirements may apply to dividends paid to a U.S. holder and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants, unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number, a certification of exempt status or has been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding (and such notification has not been withdrawn).


	Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.


	Non-U.S. Holders


	This section applies to you if you are a Non-U.S. holder. A Non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:






	


	a non-resident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates;








	


	a foreign corporation; or








	


	an estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder;




	but does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition. If you are such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of our securities.



	Taxation of Distributions.

	  In general, any distributions we make to a Non-U.S. holder of shares of our Class A common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such Non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced
	rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E). Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the Non-U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its shares of our Class A common stock and, to the extent such distribution exceeds the Non-U.S. holders adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the Class A common stock, which will be treated as described under  Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock and Warrants below. In addition, if we determine that we are likely to be classified as a United States real property holding corporation (see  Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock and Warrants below), we will withhold 10% of
	any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.



	122



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	The withholding tax does not apply to dividends paid to a Non-U.S. holder who provides a Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the Non-U.S. holder were a U.S. resident, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. A Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate).



	Exercise of a Warrant.

	  The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. holders exercise of a warrant, or the lapse of a warrant held by a Non-U.S. holder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a U.S. holder, as described under U.S. holders  Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the consequences would be similar to those described below in  Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A
	common stock and Warrants.



	Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock and Warrants.

	  A Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our Class A common stock, which would include a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not complete an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, or warrants (including an expiration or redemption of our warrants), in each case without regard to whether those securities were held as part of
	a unit, unless:






	


	the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, under certain income tax treaties, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. holder); or








	


	we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the Non-U.S. holder held our Class A common stock, and, in the case where shares of our Class A common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, the Non-U.S. holder has owned, directly or constructively, more than 5% of our Class A common stock at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or such Non-U.S. holders holding period for the shares of our Class A common stock. There can be no assurance that our Class A common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for this purpose.




	Unless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the Non-U.S. holder were a U.S. resident. Any gains described in the first bullet point above of a Non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or lower treaty rate).


	If the second bullet point above applies to a Non-U.S. holder, gain recognized by such holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our Class A common stock or warrants will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. In addition, a buyer of our Class A common stock or warrants from such holder may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 10% of the amount realized upon such disposition. We cannot determine whether we will be a U.S. real property holding corporation in the future until we complete an initial business combination. We will be classified as a U.S. real
	property holding corporation if the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

	Redemption of Class A common stock.

	  The characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a Non-U.S. holders Class A common stock pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under Description of Securities  Class A common stock generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. holders Class A common stock, as described under U.S. holders  Redemption of Class A common stock above, and the consequences of the redemption to the Non-U.S. holder
	will be as described above under Non-U.S. holders  Taxation of Distributions and Non-U.S. holders  Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A common stock and Warrants, as applicable.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.

	  Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of dividends and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants. A Non-U.S. holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States person in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding
	as well. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a Non-U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holders U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.



	FATCA Withholding Taxes.

	  Provisions commonly referred to as FATCA impose withholding of 30% on payments of dividends (including constructive dividends) on our Class A common stock or warrants, and, beginning in 2017, sales or other disposition proceeds from our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants to foreign financial institutions (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other Non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons
	of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies (typically certified as to by the delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E). If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on their investment in our securities.

	The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated to purchase all the units in the offering if any are purchased, other than those units covered by the over-allotment option described below.


	We have granted to the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase on a pro rata basis up to 1,200,000 additional units at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The option may be exercised only to cover any over-allotments of units.


	The underwriters propose to offer the units initially at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus and to selling group members at that price less a selling concession of $0.12 per unit. The underwriters and the selling group members may allow a discount of $0.01 per unit on sales to other broker/dealers. After the initial public offering the underwriters may change the public offering price and concession and discount to broker/dealers.

	Does not include (i) up to $300,000 payable to the underwriters, if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full for deferred underwriting commissions to be placed in the trust account as described herein or (ii) certain fees and expenses payable to the underwriters in connection with this offering. The deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business combination.




	We estimate that our out-of-pocket expenses for this offering will be approximately $582,500. We have agreed to pay for the FINRA-related fees and expenses of the underwriters legal counsel, not to exceed $15,000, and the costs of an investigation search firm to conduct background checks on our principals, up to a maximum of $2,600.


	Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of their founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date
	of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.


	The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except with respect to permitted transferees as described herein under Principal Stockholders  Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants).

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in that respect.


	Our units will be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol KLREU and, once the Class A common stock and warrants begin separate trading, the Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols KLRE and KLREW, respectively.


	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the representative.


	The determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company. Among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units,
	Class A common stock or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our units, Class A common stock or warrants will develop and continue after this offering.


	In connection with the offering the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.






	


	Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.








	


	Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of units in excess of the number of units the underwriters are obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of units over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of units that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of units involved is greater than the number of units in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing units in the open market.








	


	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of units to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more units than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.








	


	Penalty bids permit the representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the units originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.




	These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our units or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the units. As a result the price of our units may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on The NASDAQ National Market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.


	We are not under any contractual obligation to engage any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering, and have no present intent to do so. However, any of the underwriters may introduce us to potential target businesses or assist us in raising additional capital in the future. If any of the underwriters

	provide services to us after this offering, we may pay such underwriter fair and reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arms length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with any of the underwriters and no fees for such services will be paid to any of the underwriters prior to the date that is 90 days from the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters compensation in connection with this offering and we may pay the underwriters of this offering or any entity with which they are affiliated a finders fee or
	other compensation for services rendered to us in connection with the completion of a business combination.


	Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.


	In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
	instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.


	A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by one or more of the underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering and one or more of the underwriters participating in this offering may distribute prospectuses electronically. The representative may agree to allocate a number of units to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the underwriters and selling group members that will make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.


	Business Combination Marketing Agreement


	We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with our business combination to assist us in holding meetings with our shareholders to discuss the potential business combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities, assist us in obtaining shareholder approval for the business combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with the business combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of our initial business combination in an amount equal to
	$2,800,000 (or $3,220,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). Of such amount, we may allocate 1% of the gross proceeds of this offering to other firms that assist us with our initial business combination.


	EBC Warrants


	EarlyBirdCapital has committed that it and/or its designees will purchase 533,333 EBC warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $400,000, or $0.75 per warrant. EarlyBirdCapital has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it and/or its designees will purchase from us at a price of $0.75 per warrant as additional number of EBC warrants (up to a maximum of 80,000 EBC warrants) pro rata with the amount of the over-allotment option that was exercised. The EBC warrants are identical to the warrants being sold in this offering. The EBC warrants, and the shares of common
	stock underlying the EBC warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of the FINRA Manual commencing on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1), these securities will not be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part nor may they be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a 180-day period following the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part except to any underwriter or selected dealer participating in the offering and the bona fide officers or partners of the underwriter and any such participating underwriter or selected
	dealer. EarlyBirdCapital has agreed that the EBC warrants it and/or its designees purchase will not be sold or transferred (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after we have

	completed an initial business combination. We have granted the holders of private warrants, including EarlyBirdCapital, the registration rights as described under the section Principal Stockholders  Registration Rights. Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital has agreed that it and/or its designees will not be permitted to exercise any EBC warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.



	Canada



	Resale Restrictions


	We intend to distribute our securities in the Province of Ontario, Canada (the Canadian Offering Jurisdiction) by way of a private placement and exempt from the requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in such Canadian Offering Jurisdiction. Any resale of our securities in Canada must be made under applicable securities laws that will vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary exemption granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority.
	Canadian resale restrictions in some circumstances may apply to resales of interests made outside of Canada. Canadian purchasers are advised to seek legal advice prior to any resale of our securities. We may never be a reporting issuer, as such term is defined under applicable Canadian securities legislation, in any province or territory of Canada in which our securities will be offered and there currently is no public market for any of the securities in Canada, and one may never develop. Canadian investors are advised that we have no intention to file a prospectus or similar document with any securities regulatory authority in Canada qualifying the resale of the securities to the public in any province or territory in Canada.


	Representations of Purchasers


	A Canadian purchaser will be required to represent to us and the dealer from whom the purchase confirmation is received that:






	


	the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase our securities without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws;








	


	where required by law, that the purchaser is purchasing as principal and not as agent;








	


	the purchaser has reviewed the text above under Resale Restrictions; and








	


	the purchaser acknowledges and consents to the provision of specified information concerning its purchase of our securities to the regulatory authority that by law is entitled to collect the information.




	Rights of Action  Ontario Purchasers Only


	Under Ontario securities legislation, certain purchasers who purchase a security offered by this prospectus during the period of distribution will have a statutory right of action for damages, or while still the owner of our securities, for rescission against us in the event that this prospectus contains a misrepresentation without regard to whether the purchaser relied on the misrepresentation. The right of action for damages is exercisable not later than the earlier of 180 days from the date the purchaser first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and three years from the date on which payment is
	made for our securities. The right of action for rescission is exercisable not later than 180 days from the date on which payment is made for our securities. If a purchaser elects to exercise the right of action for rescission, the purchaser will have no right of action for damages against us. In no case will the amount recoverable in any action exceed the price at which our securities were offered to the purchaser and if the purchaser is shown to have purchased the securities with knowledge of the misrepresentation, we will have no liability. In the case of an action for damages, we will not be liable for all or any portion of the damages that are proven to not represent the depreciation in value of our securities as a result of the misrepresentation relied upon. These rights are in addition to, and without derogation from, any other rights or remedies available at law to an Ontario purchaser. The foregoing is a summary of the rights available to an Ontario purchaser. Ontario
	purchasers should refer to the complete text of the relevant statutory provisions.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	To the Board of Directors and Shareholder

	of KLR Energy Acquisition Corp.


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the period from September 21, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KLR Energy Acquisition Corp., as of December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from September 21, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has no present revenue, its business plan is dependent on the completion of a financing and the Companys cash and working capital as of December 31, 2015 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for the upcoming year. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding these matters are also described in Notes 1 and 3. These financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(the Company) was incorporated in Delaware on September 21, 2015 as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a Business Combination). The Companys efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.


	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2015 relates to the Companys formation and the proposed public offering described below. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year-end. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.


	Proposed Public Offering and Private Placement


	The Companys ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through the proposed public offering of 8,000,000 units (or 9,200,000 units if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) (Units) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit as discussed in Note 3 (the Proposed Public Offering), and the sale of an aggregate of 7,776,667 and 533,333 warrants to purchase one share of the Companys Class A common stock (the Private Placement Warrants) at a price of $0.75 per Private Placement Warrant to KLR Energy Sponsor LLC (the
	Sponsor) and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (EBC) and/or its designees, respectively. These additional Private Placement Warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the Proposed Public Offering (the Private Placement). All of the proceeds received from these purchases will be placed in the Trust Account described below. In addition, the Sponsor and EBC has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised, they and/or their respective designees will purchase from the Company an additional number of Private Placement Warrants pro rata, up to a maximum of 560,000 and 80,000 Private Placement Warrants, respectively, that is necessary to maintain in the Trust Account an amount equal to approximately $10.40 per share.


	The Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering and Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. Upon the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, management has agreed that at least $10.40 per Unit sold in the Proposed Public Offering, including the proceeds of the Private Placements will be held in a trust account
	(Trust Account) and invested in U.S. government treasuries, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and that invest solely in United States treasuries until the earlier of (i) the consummation of its initial Business Combination or (ii) the Companys failure to consummate a Business Combination within 18 months from the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering. Placing funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities it engages, execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no guarantee that such persons will execute such agreements. One of the Companys Officers will
	agree to be personally liable if the Company liquidates the Trust Account prior to the consummation of a business combination to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. However, such Officer may not be able to satisfy those obligations should they arise. The remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the interest earned on the Trust Account balance may be released to the Company for any amounts that are necessary to pay the Companys income and other tax obligations.

	  (continued)


	The amount of proceeds not held in Trust is expected to be approximately $450,000, after the payment of approximately $2.58 million in expenses related to the Proposed Public Offering, inclusive of $2.0 million of underwriting fees. In order to meet its working capital needs following the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering, the Companys Sponsor or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. The loans would either be paid upon consummation of the Companys initial Business Combination, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such loans
	(including $275,000 in loans made or to be made as described in Note 4 outstanding as of the date of the filing of the prospectus relating to the Proposed Public Offering) may be converted upon consummation of the Companys Business Combination into additional Private Placement Warrants at a price of $0.75 per Warrant. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, the loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside of the Trust Account.


	Initial Business Combination


	Pursuant to the Nasdaq Capital Markets listing rules, the Companys initial Business Combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such Business Combination, although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by the Companys board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings,
	cash flow and/or book value). The target business or businesses that the Company acquires may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the Trust Account balance. In order to consummate such a Business Combination, the Company may issue a significant amount of its debt or equity securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. If the Companys securities are not listed on NASDAQ after the Proposed Public Offering, the Company would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, the Company intends to satisfy the 80% requirement even if the Companys securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of the initial Business Combination.


	The Company will provide the public stockholders, who are the holders of the Class A common stock which will be sold as part of the Units in the Proposed Public Offering, whether they are purchased in the Proposed Public Offering or in the aftermarket, or Public Shares, including the Companys shareholders prior to the Proposed Public Offering (included the Sponsor) (the Initial Stockholders) to the extent that they purchase such Public Shares (Public Stockholders), with an opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares of the Companys Class A common stock,
	irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if the Company conducts a tender offer, upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.40 per Public Share. The common stock subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified a temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the
	Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and in the case of a stockholder vote, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require it to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company decides not to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation, (i) conduct the

	redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and (ii) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing the initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.


	The Initial Stockholders will agree to vote their Founder Shares (as described in Note 6) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Public Offering in favor of the initial Business Combination, and the Companys executive officers, directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Public Offering in favor of the initial Business Combination. The Initial Stockholders will enter into a letter agreement, pursuant to which they agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the
	completion of the initial Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Stockholders will also agree to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if the Initial Stockholders (or any of the Companys executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire Public Shares in or after the Proposed Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares in the event the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within such applicable time period.


	Failure to Consummate a Business Combination


	If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering, the Company must: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public
	stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.


	Going Concern Consideration


	At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $106,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $98,000. Further, the Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to address this uncertainty through the Proposed Public Offering as discussed in Note 3. There is no assurance that the Companys plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful or
	successful within the required time period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies




	Emerging growth company


	The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its
	periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


	Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is
	irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.


	Basis of Presentation


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC.


	Cash and cash equivalents


	The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015.


	Concentration of credit risk


	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company had not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.


	Loss per share


	Loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period excluding shares subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares was reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 487,500 shares of Class F common stock that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters of which 187,500 shares subject to forfeiture were already canceled in February and March 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common
	stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share.

	  (continued)


	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Fair value of financial instruments


	The fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.


	Deferred Offering Costs


	Deferred offering costs consist principally of legal, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Proposed Public Offering and that will be charged to stockholders equity upon the receipt of the capital raised. Should the Proposed Public Offering prove to be unsuccessful, these deferred costs as well as additional expenses to be incurred will be charged to operations.


	Income Taxes


	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.


	ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Based on the Companys evaluation, it
	has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Companys financial statements. Since the Company was incorporated on September 21, 2015, the evaluation was performed for the upcoming 2015 tax year, which will be the only period subject to examination upon filing of appropriate tax returns. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material changes to its financial position.


	The Companys policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the period from September 21, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.


	The provision for income taxes was deemed to be immaterial for the period ended December 31, 2015.


	Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a companys ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a companys ability to

	continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the methodologies prescribed by ASU 2014-15 by the date required, and does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.


	Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.




	Note 3  Proposed Public Offering and Private Placement




	Proposed Public Offering


	The Proposed Public Offering calls for the Company to offer for public sale 8,000,000 Units at a proposed offering price of $10.00 per Unit (plus up to an additional 1,200,000 Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any). Each Unit consists of one share of the Companys Class A common stock and one warrant to receive one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (Warrants). The Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (i) 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, and
	will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.


	The Company may redeem the Warrants, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon 30 days notice (30-day redemption period), only in the event that the last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day
	redemption period. If the Company calls the Warrants for redemption as described above, the Companys management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise Warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the management will consider, among other factors, the Companys cash position, the number of Warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on the Companys stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants.


	There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 18-month time period.


	Private Placement


	The Sponsor and EBC have committed that they will purchase from the Company an aggregate of 7,776,667 and 533,333 (or 8,336,667 and 613,333, respectively, if the over-allotment is exercised in full) Private Placement Warrants, respectively, at $0.75 per warrant for a total purchase price of $6,232,500 (or $6,712,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). These purchases will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering. The proceeds from the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants will be added to the proceeds of the Proposed Public
	Offering and placed in the Trust Account. If the Company fails to consummate the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares, and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.

	Note 3  Proposed Public Offering and Private Placement


	  (continued)


	The Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the warrants sold in the Proposed Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and none of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EBC and/or its designees has agreed that it will not be permitted to exercise any of their Private
	Placement Warrants after the five year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement for the Proposed Public Offering.




	Note 4  Related Party Transactions




	As of December 31, 2015, the Sponsor has loaned an aggregate of $175,000 out of the agreed maximum amount of $275,000, to cover expenses related to the Companys formation and the Proposed Public Offering. This note as amended on February 29, 2016, is payable without interest, payable on the consummation of the initial Business Combination and convertible, at the lenders discretion, into additional Private Placement Warrants at $0.75 per Warrant.


	In connection with the consummation of the Companys Business Combination, or thereafter, the Company may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees. The amount of fees the Company may pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of the Companys audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of
	interest.




	Note 5  Commitments




	Agreements with underwriters


	The Company will grant the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,200,000 additional Units to cover the over-allotment at the Proposed Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to an underwriting discount of 2.5%, payable in cash at the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, plus deferred underwriting commissions of up to $300,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised. The deferred underwriting commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business combination, in an amount equal to $300,000
	multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the number of Units sold in any over-allotment offering by (b) $1,500,000. No discounts or commissions will be paid on the sale of the Private Placement Warrants.


	The Company has also engaged the underwriter as an advisor with the Companys Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with the shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing the Companys securities, assist the Company in obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination, and assist the Company with the press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay the underwriter a cash fee for such services upon the
	consummation of the initial Business Combination in an amount equal to $2,800,000 (or $3,220,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). Of such amount, the Company may allocate 1% of the gross proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering to other firms that assist the Company with the initial Business Combination.


	Registration Rights


	The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the

	effective date of the Proposed Public Offering; thus requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Companys Class A common stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, EBC may not exercise its demand and piggy-back registration rights after five (5) and seven (7) years after the effective date of the registration statement of the Proposed Public Offering and may not exercise its demand rights on more than one occasion. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company
	registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of the initial Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.


	The Company is not registering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants at this time. However, the Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use the best efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants no later than 90 days after the closing of the Companys initial Business Combination, and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock until the
	Warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants included in the Units offered in the Proposed Public Offering (Public Warrant) is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of the Companys initial Business Combination, holders of Public Warrants may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the
	exercise price of the Warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis.


	Other General and Administrative Services


	The Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Companys behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The Companys audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, executive officers, directors or affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
	incurred by such persons in connection with activities on the Companys behalf provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by the Company unless the Company consummates an initial Business Combination.

	Note 6  Stockholders Equity




	Preferred Stock


	The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors. As of December 31, 2015, no preferred stock is issued or outstanding.


	Common Stock


	The Company is authorized to issue 41,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, including


	(i) 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (ii) 6,000,000 shares of Class F common stock.


	Each share of Class F common stock shall convert into its

	pro rata

	number of shares of Class A common stock, determined as follows: each share of Class F common stock shall convert into such number of shares of Class A common stock that equals to the product of 1 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Class A common stock into which all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class F common stock shall be converted and the denominator of which shall be the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Class F common stock at the time of conversion.


	In connection with the organization of the Company, a total of 4,312,500 shares of Class F common stock were sold to the Sponsor at a price of approximately $0.006 per share for an aggregate of $25,000 (Founder Shares). In December 2015 and February and March 2016, the Sponsor and the Companys officers returned an aggregate of 575,000, 862,500, and 575,000 Founder Shares, respectively, at no cost, which were canceled by the Company. In addition, the Sponsor agreed to forfeit an aggregate of up to 300,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option is not
	exercised in full so that the Initial Stockholders will own 20% of the issued and outstanding shares (excluding shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants) after the Proposed Public Offering.


	In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities convertible or exercisable for Class A common stock, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Proposed Public Offering and related to the closing of the Business Combination, the conversion ratio will be adjusted so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class F common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of the Proposed Public Offering plus all shares of
	Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the Business Combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the Business Combination or pursuant to Private Placement Warrants issued to Sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account any Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the Business Combination.


	Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of the Founder Shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold until the earlier of: (i) one year after the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after the initial Business Combination, and the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold until six months after the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination, or
	earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to the Companys initial Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.
