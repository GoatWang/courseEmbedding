					Full Description



Dynex Capital, Inc., incorporated on January 28, 2015, is an internally managed mortgage real estate investment trust (mortgage REIT), which invests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities on a leveraged basis. The Company's objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its shareholders over the long term that is reflective of a leveraged fixed income portfolio with a focus on capital preservation. The Company seeks to provide returns to its shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and through capital appreciation. The Company invests in Agency and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). MBS consist of residential MBS (RMBS), commercial MBS (CMBS) and CMBS interest-only (IO) securities. Agency MBS have a guaranty of principal payment by an agency of the United States Government or a government-sponsored entity (GSE), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-Agency MBS have no such guaranty of payment. The Company invests its capital pursuant to its Operating Policies, such as investment philosophy and strategy, financing strategy and hedging strategy.RMBSThe Company's Agency RMBS investments include MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARMS), which have interest rates that generally will adjust at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans (hybrid ARMs), which are loans that have a fixed rate of interest for a specified period (typically 3 to 10 years) and then adjust their interest rate at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. Agency ARMs also include hybrid Agency ARMs that are past their fixed-rate periods or within over 12 months of their initial reset period. The Company may also invest in fixed-rate Agency RMBS from time to time. Additionally, it invests in non-Agency RMBS, which are Non-Agency RMBS are collateralized by non-conforming residential mortgage loans and are tranched into different classes of securities with payments to junior classes subordinate to senior classes. The Company invests in senior classes of non-Agency RMBS.CMBSThe Company's Agency and non-Agency CMBS are collateralized by first mortgage loans and are primarily fixed-rate securities backed by multifamily housing and other commercial real estate property types, such as office building, retail, hospitality and healthcare. Loans underlying CMBS generally are geographically diverse, are fixed-rate, mature in 08 to 18 years and have amortization terms of up to 30 years. These loans have some form of prepayment protection provisions (such as prepayment lock-out) or prepayment compensation provisions (such as yield maintenance or prepayment penalty). Non-Agency CMBS also includes securities that are backed by pools of single-family rental homes, which have variable-rates that reset monthly based on an index rate, such as London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).CMBS IOThe Company's CMBS IO are interest-only securities issued as part of a CMBS securitization and represent the right to receive interest payments (but not principal cash flows) based on the unpaid principal balance of the underlying pool of commercial mortgage loans. It invests in both Agency-issued and non-Agency issued CMBS IO. CMBS IO securities have a level of prepayment protection, including absolute loan prepayment lock-outs, loan prepayment penalties, or yield maintenance requirements associated with the underlying loans similar to CMBS.

Style Scores:



A Value | D Growth | D Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
