                                    Patents by Inventor John W. Theis
                                




                    John W. Theis has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







HEIGHT ADJUSTABLE DESKTOP WORK SURFACE



Publication number:  20150289641
                                            

Abstract:  In one example, a height adjustable desktop system is described that can include a work surface, a foot assembly and a linkage assembly that adjustably connects the work surface to the foot assembly allowing vertical adjustment of the work surface. The linkage assembly can include a pair of adjustment assemblies, each having a transverse linkage that maintains the work surface in a horizontal orientation as the work surface is elevated or lowered. A biasing mechanism, such as an extension spring or a torsion spring, biases the work surface toward the elevated position.

Monitor support system



Patent number:  6994306
                                            

Abstract:  A system for providing support and position control of a monitor. In one embodiment, a method of supporting a monitor includes converting an ascending energy storage member force curve into a substantially constant supporting force against the monitor. In one aspect, a method of supporting a monitor includes providing an energy storage member and a cam which are cooperatively positioned so as to move relative to each other along the path of motion. As the energy storage member moves along the path relative to the cam, the cam displaces the energy storage member and thereby changes a force applied by the energy storage member on the cam, and wherein the cam converts the force applied by the energy storage member into a supporting force on the monitor.

Cable management system



Patent number:  6233791
                                            

Abstract:  Cable management system for securing cables to static or variable geometry host surfaces. The cable management system is in the form of a resilient U-shaped clip having, at its ends, outwardly open channels which forcefully engage slots in the body of a host object to form a capture area between the U-shaped clip and the surface of the host object. Positional security of the cable management system is provided by an anchoring tab extending inwardly from the interior region of the U-shaped clip through which a fastener is extended to engage a hole in the host object.
