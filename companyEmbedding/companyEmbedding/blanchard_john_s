Overview

In the John Blanchard Collection, the internationally-known preacher, teacher, and author brings fresh insight to numerous apologetic topics. Defending the Christian faith, John Blanchard tackles such issues as morality, Scripture’s inerrancy, suffering and pain, heaven and hell, God’s existence and relevancy, and the importance of Christ’s coming, death, and resurrection. He engages “new atheism,” traces the development of atheistic and agnostic thinking, presents Darwinian evolutionism’s flaws, and illustrates the importance of science in the Christian faith. The collection also includes devotional readings and studies on the Minor Prophets, Mark, Luke, and James, as well as Blanchard’s popular Complete Gathered Gold—a compilation of thousands of quotes from hundreds of sources.
Perfect for students, pastors, and laypersons alike, the Logos edition of these apologetic works is fully searchable and easily accessible. Scripture passages are linked directly to your English translations and to the original language texts, and important theological concepts are linked to dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a wealth of resources in your digital library.


Key Features

Can We Be Good Without God?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2007
Pages: 40

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




One of the things that distinguishes humankind from every other species on earth is that we have a moral dimension. A moral law seems to be programmed into our psychological “software” and our awareness of it is triggered by the conscience, a mysterious monitor that pokes its nose into every nook and cranny of our lives.
Why should this be the case? Does our moral sense come from nature? Is it nothing more than a cultural phenomenon? Is personal preference the deciding factor? Have we any right to question another person’s moral choices? Are there consistent guidelines for deciding whether something is good or evil, right or wrong, just or unjust?
Beyond these and other related questions lies an even greater one: Can we ever find a solid and coherent basis for morality unless our world view has God at the very centre of it? Getting the right answers may change your life.







The Complete Gathered Gold

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2010
Pages: 703

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Over 20 years ago John Blanchard compiled “A treasury of quotations for Christians” called Gathered Gold. It was so well-received that it had to be reprinted several times and augmented by two further volumes, More Gathered Gold and Sifted Silver. Now this material is available to a new readership and in a new format. Approximately 1,000 quotations have been added, bringing the total to 16,000 quotations.
With quotations from hundreds of sources, The Complete Gathered Gold is sure to be a valuable resource for preachers, Bible class teachers and group leaders, as well as a “gold mine” for all Christians to dip into whenever they would like to read a gem of truth on any of the 600 subjects covered.







Dealing with Dawkins

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2010
Pages: 95

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this volume, author John Blanchard engages with the so-called “new atheism” promoted by Richard Dawkins in his books The God Delusion and The Greatest Show on Earth. He concisely—but clearly—outlines Dawkins’ views and arguments, deftly demonstrates how shallow and illogical they often are, and provides God-centered alternatives that are altogether superior.
Blanchard tackles such subjects as the importance but limitations of science, the origin and significance of morality, and Dawkins’ abysmal ignorance of theology and the Bible. He then goes on to explain the nature of true faith before ending with a clear presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.


Perfect for our skeptical times, this book will demonstrate to any open-minded reader that, contrary to Dawkins’ atheistic claims, biblical Christianity is reliable and relevant, powerful and persuasive.
—Edgar Andrews, emeritus professor of materials, University of London







Does God Believe in Atheists?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 655

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This award-winning title traces the development of atheistic and agnostic thinking over the past 2,500 years and shows how thinkers like Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Neitzsche, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and others have shaped many people’s thinking today.
It also pinpoints the flaws in Darwinian evolutionism and in claims made for it by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and others, explains why secular humanism self-destructs, reveals why there is no conflict between science and belief in God, exposes fatal errors in nine world religions and fourteen major cults, and shows why the existence of evil and suffering is no reason to deny God’s existence.


This is Blanchard at his best: immensely thorough, crystal clear, devastating in his logic, compassionate at heart. No stone is left unturned: a brilliant defense of belief in God—and its implications!
—Andrew Anderson, International Baptist Church of Brussels
This book is a remarkable outcome of 40 years or so experience of John Blanchard as an evangelist, Bible teacher, and writer. His incisive style combined with his ability to draw upon a wide range of sources have resulted in a book in which the overall flow of thought provides an immensely readable and persuasive argument for the classical, biblical, Christian faith.
—J. M. V. Blanshard, fellow, Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST)
John Blanchard not only has the knack of answering a skeptic’s questions with precision, clarity, and subtle humor, he has the uncanny ability to answer questions before they arise in the skeptic’s mind. This book is destined to be a classic on the subject.
—Wade Burleson, pastor, Emmanuel Baptist Church, Enid, OK
Anyone reading this volume will immediately see the level of study and research that has gone into its preparation. Its scope and subject matter are of the greatest importance today and it is to be hoped that it will have the impact upon people’s thinking that it deserves.
—A. T. B. McGowan, honorary professor of Reformed doctrine, University of Aberdeen
A veritable tour de force. Not only does the author fairly and squarely face the doubts and contradictions posed by unbelievers, but he also provides evidence that is both accessible and convincing.
—Daniel Webber, mission director, European Missionary Fellowship
John Blanchard’s arguments lead to the inevitable conclusion that atheism is both illogical and untenable. Anyone who remains an atheist after reading this volume does so in willful contradiction of the overwhelming evidence for the existence of God.
—A. J. Monty White, former chief executive, Answers in Genesis







Evolution: Fact or Fiction?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2002
Pages: 39

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The theory of evolution has been called “the most powerful and the most comprehensive idea that has ever arisen on earth.” It has been so passionately argued and so heavily promoted in the mass media that millions of people with no scientific expertise assume it must be true.
Evolutionism says that life on earth began by chance in some kind of chemical “soup,” and claims that Homosapiens is the latest product of a vast sequence of species that led from the first living cell through invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, furry quadrupeds, and ape-like mammals. What is the evidence for this fascinating scenario? Can we prove that life began in this way? What are the odds against such a thing happening? Has archaeology found clear links between all species without limitation? Can we really show that all life forms owe their distinct existence to random, unplanned, accidental genetic changes? Or is there another explanation?







Has Science Got Rid of God?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2004
Pages: 133

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this volume, John Blanchard tackles an age-old question that is still troubling many thoughtful people today—and gives a clear and convincing answer, drawing on material from some of the greatest scientists in history. Easy to read and packed with excellent illustrations.


Has science got rid of God? Is atheism essential to scientific progress? If you think the answer to both questions is ‘yes,’ read this book and think again! In a pithy series of discussions John Blanchard cogently argues that the answer has to be otherwise and shows that the whole arena of science rests on divine foundations.
—Colin Runciman, professor, Department of Computer Science, University of York
Aided and abetted by the mass media, those who insist that science makes Christian faith untenable grow increasingly strident. In this readable and scintillating response John Blanchard answers these claims with facts, clarity, and impeccable logic. This book will encourage Christians and challenge those who are not. It should be read by both.
—Edgar Andrews, emeritus professor of materials, University of London
With the skill of a neurosurgeon, John Blanchard deals with the false assumptions behind the idea that science and God are incompatible. In this rational and honest approach he demonstrates that far from being nonexistent, God is the source and sustainer of all true science and scientific principles.
—James D. Blankenship, former president and CEO, EmpowerMD.com







How to Enjoy Your Bible

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2007
Pages: 185

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




John Blanchard believes that Christians are meant to enjoy the Bible, and that reading the Scriptures should be an exciting adventure into God’s truth and purposes for our lives.
This book is written out of two firmly held convictions. The first is that the Bible is the Word of God. The second conviction is that Christians are meant to enjoy the Bible. It is meant to be a constant means of enlightenment, enrichment, and encouragement, its dynamic influence bringing a deepening joy into our daily lives. Sadly, many Christians seem to fall short of that experience. They read the Bible, perhaps regularly, but if they were to be absolutely honest about their reading they would have to confess that the whole business has become a duty rather than a delight. Others have gotten into a rut over the method they use for studying the Bible, becoming bored rather than blessed. However, Scripture is not basically meant to be a rescue operation. This volume illustrates how you can enjoy the Bible and find a daily source of spiritual power in it.


Do you want a lifetime of rich, delightful study of the Bible? Is there a simple, reliable, clear, yet substantial resource that provides a superb background and framework? Yes! John Blanchard’s How to Enjoy Your Bible.
—J. Ligon Duncan III, pastor, First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi
Simple, vivid, warm, practical, and searching, it is all that we have come to expect of its author.
—J. I. Packer, Board of Governors’ Professor of Theology, Regent College, Vancouver, Canada
This book by John Blanchard goes beyond merely being helpful. I would put it on the ‘must read’ list of every believer. It will be an enormous help, encouragement and motivator for all who read it.
—Frank Retief, emeritus presiding bishop, Church of England, South Africa
No Christian will fail to be thrilled, stirred, and challenged by this timely reminder of the divine source, steadfast preservation, and timeless relevance of the Book of Books, which alone transforms lives.
—Jonathan Wood, pastor, Whittlesey Baptist Church, Cambridgeshire, England
Writing with his usual clarity John Blanchard enthuses about the Bible, giving the reader a hunger to plumb its depths and delight in its riches. I will be warmly and enthusiastically commending it to my own people.
—Philip Hair, minister, Holyrood Abbey Church of Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland
We are all indebted to John Blanchard for such a profound presentation. I regard this as the best introduction to the Scriptures and their companionship that a Christian could first read.
—Geoff Thomas, pastor, Alfred Place Baptist Church, Aberystwyth, Wales
Superb! Packed full of helpful information and useful tips, this accessible little volume will give you an appreciation of, and deepen your delight in, the Bible as the Word of God.
—Steven Curry, pastor, Bethany Baptist Church, Bangor, North Ireland







Is Anybody Out There?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2006
Pages: 38

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4




Ever since humankind has lived on earth we have been teased or tormented by questions that seem programmed into our humanity.
The most important go far beyond those that focus on the kind of issues millions face every day—marriage problems, financial worries, failing health, pain, loneliness, insecurity, and depression. They ask such things as “Why am I here?”; “Would it matter if I had never been born?”; “Does life need to have any meaning?”; and “What happens to me when I die?”
Yet these questions eventually funnel into others that are even deeper: “Is there anything beyond ‘one’ universe?”; “Are we biological accidents living for a blink of time in a vast and vacant cosmos?”; “Is there other (and greater) intelligence elsewhere?”; “Is there a theory of everything, or one reality that governs all the others?” Then comes the ultimate question: “Is anybody out there?” This volume explores the issues—and points to the answers.







Is God Past His Sell-By Date?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2002
Pages: 268

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




From time to time, philosophers, scientists, authors, and other movers and shakers have hit the headlines with claims that God is non-existent, irrelevant, or “past his sell-by date.”
This book has been written specifically for those who take a similar line, who think that God is non-existent or irrelevant, or who are in some way skeptical about the whole issue.
Although on the same theme as Does God believe in Atheists? this is an entirely new book aimed toward those who consider themselves to be atheists and to challenge their view. Each chapter ends with a “witness” who from their own personal experience supports the claim made by the author in the chapter.


Does God exist? If so, how can he sit by through pain, suffering, and injustice? Hasn’t science explained him away? With brilliantly researched, intelligently constructed, logical arguments, John Blanchard provides the most thought-provoking, scholarly yet accessible responses I have ever read. This book is a must for the serious thinker.
—Jill Garrett, board member, Open Doors USA
A fascinating panorama of major issues, from philosophy to genetics, from Darwinism to the problem of death. John Blanchard has a masterful command of the pertinent literature, and drives his argument home with telling quotations from opponents and friends alike.
—Edgar Andrews, emeritus professor of materials, University of London
This outstanding work irrefutably shows that atheism is pure fantasy and that God has no expiration date—past, present, or future.
—George Vaughan, director of digital program management and business development, Subscribers Network Services, USA
Here is a book that will change lives. I could not put it down. It deals with the biggest questions anybody could ask, and gives answers that even the most belligerent skeptic will find convincing.
—Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor, University of Bedfordshire







Jesus: Dead or Alive?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 40

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Christianity stands or falls on one stupendous event: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If he is now no more than a handful of dust and bones lying somewhere in Israel, the Christian faith lies buried with him. In this new publication, John Blanchard examines the evidence, assesses the alternatives, and provides a convincing conclusion.
Here is a little volume that will strengthen the faith of countless Christians—and give them a dynamic means of sharing the faith with others.


Jesus Christ either rose from the dead or he did not—and Christianity is only credible if he did! The truth is, no matter how often this particular ‘cold case’ file is reviewed, the evidence always points unwaveringly in the same direction. Relentlessly hunting down and dispatching alternative theories, old and new, John Blanchard leaves his readers not merely with a clear conclusion, but also with a stark choice.
—Jonathan Stephen, principal, Wales Evangelical School of Theology
. . . the author effectively deals with the factual basis and intrinsic significance of the physical, bodily rising again of Jesus Christ from the dead. John Blanchard, in addressing the question of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, persuasively counters false ideas that deny either the possibility or actuality of Christ’s resurrection. He also powerfully brings out the central importance of that historical event for Christian faith and life after death. This is a welcome and needed emphasis for our skeptical age, and the booklet contains an appealing evangelistic message for those who are unconvinced and unbelieving.
—John W. Keddie, minister, Free Church of Scotland, Bracadale, Isle of Skye, Scotland







Luke Comes Alive!

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2004
Pages: 158

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4




This volume includes 62 guidelines for personal reading through the Gospel of Luke. Both stimulating and challenging, this series of notes is designed to explain Luke’s Gospel and to help you see its relevance to everyday living. Outline expositions and pithy comments make Luke Comes Alive! ideal for discussion groups and Bible studies, as well as personal reading.







Major Points from the Minor Prophets

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 280

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




A simple way to introduce these studies in the Minor Prophets will be to ask and answer several questions about them: Who were they? Why are they known as “Minor Prophets”? When and where did they live? What was their ministry? What was their message? Once we have answers to these questions we will be in a position to look at the prophets’ main themes before focusing on one specific statement made by each one of them.
Not only should we rely wholeheartedly on the faithful exposition of the Bible as the written Word of God, we should not insist on signs and wonders as an authentication of a preacher’s ministry. The message is clear: if people will not listen to the Word of God and turn to him in repentance and faith as a result, no “signs and wonders” will move them to do so, not even a long-buried friend coming back to life.
The Bible is the only infallible Word we have or need, revealing to us that in the Lord Jesus Christ we have the Prophet to end all prophets, the Priest to end all priests, and the King to end all kings. Our great need today is not for prophets but for preachers, men who will give themselves sacrificially to the study of the Word of God and to its systematic exegesis and exposition, “rightly handling the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15) and applying its truth to their hearers.


Any book that encourages us to study the Minor Prophets has to be welcomed. Any book written by John Blanchard has to be welcomed. So this book promises to be a great treat.
—Phillip Jensen, dean, St Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, Australia
Thank you John Blanchard for this excellent resource. It is full of information, explanation, and inspiration. You have whetted my appetite to dig deeper in the Minor Prophets.
—Kenneth Clarke, Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin, and Ardagh, Ireland







Meet the Real Jesus

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2010
Pages: 218

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This volume is simple without being simplistic, and doctrinally rich without sounding dull and dry. Best of all, it persuasively presents the truth about Jesus Christ in such a coherent way that anybody who reads it can’t possibly miss its message.


A magnificent work by a gifted man.
—Adrian Rogers, former pastor, Bellevue Baptist Church, Memphis, TN
In this superlative book John Blanchard has greatly increased the debt we already owe him.
—Alec Motyer, former principal, Trinity College, Bristol, England
Here is communication par excellence . . . presented with comprehensive authority, nobody who reads this can possibly miss its message.
—John F. MacArthur Jr., pastor-teacher, Grace Community Church, Sun Valley, CA
Highly recommended . . . Here, instead of the fuzzy versions of the Christian faith . . . are the facts of the matter splendidly brought together and clearly argued.
—Dick Lucas, emeritus rector, St. Helen’s Bishopsgate, London, England
Quite honestly a brilliant book, and one which could be of enormous benefit to Christian and non-believer.
—Your Tomorrow
Racy and readable, clear and convincing.
—Evangelical Times







Read Mark Learn

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 48

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4




When a person becomes a Christian, nothing is more important than that they should begin reading the Bible on a daily basis. It is “the living and enduring word of God” by which his people are helped to learn more about him, to grow in grace, to discover God’s purpose for their lives, to resist temptation, and to live in a way “worthy of the Gospel.”
Read Mark Learn has been specifically written to get new Christians started on this exciting journey. It divides the Gospel of Mark into 45 daily readings, with a page of easy-to-read notes on each passage, leading the reader through Mark’s exhilarating record of Christ’s life on earth.







Truth for Life: A Devotional Commentary on the Epistle of James

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 412

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4




No part of the Bible is more dynamically relevant to today’s ethical culture and spiritual climate than the Letter of James. It tackles twenty-first century issues head-on, ruthlessly exposing our pressures and problems and showing how they can be overcome by the indwelling grace of God. John Blanchard vividly expounds this message with clarity and conviction—and with an enthusiasm that makes Truth for Life a book to read, studied, and lived!


God has greatly blessed John Blanchard with the gifts of exposition and clarity. You will not find the Letter of James made plainer or more applicable to life.
—Evangelism Today
The exegesis is adequate yet concise, contemporary and incisive, with vivid illustration and anecdote. Personal testimony, discerning application, humor, and zest build up a fine commentary.
—The Christian Record
If Christianity can become as real and refreshing to the many who will, I hope, read this book as it is to the author, then this ought to be a bestseller.
—Word in Action
A veritable feast of good things. It cannot help but profit the diligent reader.
—English Churchman
John Blanchard shows faultless theological balance. This book is practical, relevant, and soundly based . . . I commend it most warmly to the reader.
—Fred Catherwood, former director general, National Economic Development Council







Ultimate Questions

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 32

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Health, finance, family, the future—life is full of questions. There are deeper questions, too. Who am I? Why am I here? Where am I going? Does life have any purpose? But the ultimate questions are about God. Does he exist? What is he like? Can I know him and experience his power in my life? And if so, how? This little volume tackles these vital questions head-on—and answers them simply, clearly, and directly. Read it carefully. It could change your life—forever.







Whatever Happened to Hell?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 336

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Nobody can think seriously about hell and remain emotionally and psychologically unaffected. The idea that after a few years of life on earth an untold number of human beings, many of whom would be thought of as decent, law-abiding citizens, will spend eternity in indescribable agony and exposed to God’s relentless anger is overwhelming.
Reaction to the paralyzing prospect of everlasting punishment varies from those who dismiss the whole idea because they reject the authority of Scripture to those who seek to soften its impact by reducing hell to manageable proportions. What does happen after death? What if the traditional pictures of hell as a place of endless punishment and suffering are true? What if millions of ordinary men and woman are on their way there? What if we are? And if so, is there any way in which we can avoid hell or evade it? These are vitally important questions and this book sets out to find answers to them.







Where do We Go from Here?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2008
Pages: 40

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




“Where do we go from here?” is the final question all humanity faces, and this volume tackles it head-on. Exactly what does happen to us when we die? The immediate future of the body is fairly obvious, but what about the spirit or soul? Is it annihilated or reincarnated? Is it conscious or unconscious? Do we face endless pain or endless pleasure? Is there a “second chance” to put things right? Do we have to wait until after we die to find out? This volume answers these and other questions biblically, clearly, and in a user-friendly way. Here is an ideal resource to share with people who have no grasp of the Christian message.


John Blanchard is nothing if he is not precise in his use of words; everyone is weighed and meaningful. In Where Do We Go From Here?, John has also shown himself to be intrepid. Most of us will not read another publication on the subject of death, but even if we did, we would be hard pressed to find a better one than this. It is Bible based, thorough, and honest.
—Roger Carswell, Evangelist, Leeds, England







Where Is God When Things Go Wrong?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 39

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




We live in what has been called “a world with ragged edges.” Earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, fires, famine, and other natural disasters kill millions of people and injure countless others, sometimes wiping out huge numbers within a few hours.
Every day, accidents claim an untold number of victims. Planes crash, trains are derailed, road vehicles collide, ships are lost at sea, buildings collapse, bridges give way, trees fall, machinery malfunctions. To make matters worse, disease cuts relentless swathes through humankind, causing immeasurable weakness, pain and fear, while “man’s inhumanity to man” brings a terrible toll of suffering.
Yet the Bible claims that God is in sole and sovereign control of everything that happens in the entire universe, that he “works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will” and that he is “compassionate and gracious” and “abounding in love.” Is there any way in which all of this can hold together? The answer may surprise you!







Why Believe the Bible?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 40

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The Bible is the most revered book in the world; it is also the most reviled. Millions of people turn to it every day to find inspiration and direction for their lives, yet for two thousand years no other book has been so hated, vilified, and attacked. Many of its translators have been persecuted, tortured, and murdered, and countless copies of their work have been banned or destroyed. Yet for many people the Bible is neither loved nor loathed; it is nothing more than an ancient religious document that raises a host of questions. How can we know that the present text is anything like the original? Is it anything more than folklore? How can such an old book be relevant in the twenty-first century? Has science not taken its place as an explanation of the world and our place in it? Here are the answers.







Why on Earth did Jesus Come?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 40

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Year after year, millions of people pitch into a growing whirlwind of activity in preparation for just one day: December twenty-fifth. Many of those who join in the excitement have at least some idea that this particular day is called Christmas day because it celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Yet, they have no idea why for millions of people around the world it has become the greatest highlight of the year. It’s time to ask some questions.
Who was this Jesus? Do we actually know when he was born? Was there a special purpose in his birth? Is there anything special that makes him stand out over the other 60 billion people that have lived on earth? How can a few years he spent here have any possible relevance for people living in the twenty-first century? Why should we bother to find out?
In this lively volume Blanchard strips away the myths and tells like it is. Here is the real story. The dynamic truth that over the centuries has revolutionized countless lives. Read it carefully. If you get the message, no Christmas Day will ever be the same for you again—nor will any other day!







Why the Cross?

Author: John Blanchard
Publisher: Evangelical Press
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 48

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




For centuries, symbols have been used as a means of identification, often in an immediate, compact, and powerful way. For some two thousand years, Christianity has had a symbol that is universally recognized—a simple cross. Yet the cross represents not the character, life or teaching of the founder of Christianity, but the gruesome way in which he was put to death while still in his early thirties.
For millions today, a cross has become little more than a charm or good luck bracelet, tattooed on their bodies, or worn as jewelry. The huge gap between the original event and the current symbol therefore raises some massive questions:

Why has the symbol remained so universally popular?
Was there anything unique about the crucifixion of Jesus?
Why was he put to death?
What difference can it make to me today?

Here is a volume that answers all these questions—and many more—and makes it crystal clear that in the death of Jesus lies our only hope of the forgiveness of sins and eternal life.


Have you ever wondered why Christians see so much significance in the death of Jesus Christ on a cross? Why did Jesus have to die? Why such a humiliating public execution? And what does His death mean for me? John Blanchard answers those questions and, drawing on the eyewitness accounts recorded in the Bible, he explains the meaning of the cross in a clear, simple, powerful way.
—John F. MacArthur Jr., pastor-teacher, Grace Community Church, Sun Valley, CA
In these pages that mighty work which in all its greatness was accomplished on Calvary’s cross by the Lord who is both Creator and Redeemer is brought before us with clarity, reverence and spiritual insight. In the Savior who suffered on Golgotha we see the glory of the only God there is, his amazing grace to those who put their trust in him. Here we meet the foundation for God’s gift of everlasting life.’
—Geoff Thomas, pastor, Alfred Place Baptist Church, Aberystwyth, Wales
John Blanchard superbly invites the reader in his typically serious, yet relevant, way to examine why Jesus should die as He did. Here is a thrilling reminder of what God did, in the sending of His Son, to secure salvation. I shall certainly be encouraging my people to use this resource so that many others may, in Watts’ words, survey the wondrous cross!
—Jonathan Wood
Urgently needed, lucidly written, Blanchard drives home the meaning of the cross of Jesus. No topic is more important than this one. Without the cross (and the substitutionary atonement of which it speaks), we are doomed for eternity. Read this and then, with the Apostle Paul, boast in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
—Derek W. H. Thomas, professor of systematic and historical theology, Reformed Theological Seminary

Areas of Research: My laboratory is engaged in the structural and functional characterization of enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have discovered new drug combinations that are effective against strains of drug resistant Tuberculosis

Professional Interests
John S. Blanchard Research Interests The treatment of bacterial infections with antibiotics is being severely compromised by the rapid development and dissemination of drug resistance and has become of significant clinical concern. Through a combination of recombinant DNA methods, protein purification, kinetic and chemical mechanistic analysis and three-dimensional structural description, we are developing several enzymes into validated targets for subsequent inhibitor, and potential drug design. Essential Bacterial Biosynthetic Pathways Bacteria must produce all twenty amino acids and all organic enzyme cofactors that were identified as vitamins. Many of these pathways are known to be essential for bacterial survival, and the pantothenate pathway is one such pathway. Insertional inactivation of the panC&D genes results in strains of M. tuberculosis that are highly attenuated.
We have focused on the enzymological characterization of the early steps, unique to bacteria and plants, of Coenzyme A biosynthesis, an essential pathway in M. tuberculosis. Starting with the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate, pantothenate is generated by a series of enzymatic steps with few precedents in biology. These include one of two examples of a B12-independent 1,2-methyl shift (acetolactate isomeroreductase), a reductive formyltransfer (ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase) and one of only a few examples of an ATP-dependent amide forming reaction (pantothenate synthetase). Our enzymatic studies have been spurred by the recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of most of the enzymes in this pathway. Antibiotic Drug Resistance Studies from this laboratory were responsible for the identification of the target of the most widely used anti-tubercular drug, isoniazid, as being the M. tuberculosis enoyl-ACP reductase.
More recently, our efforts have turned to the determination of the mechanisms of resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular the aminoglycoside class of antibacterials. Clinical resistance to aminoglycosides is due to the expression of genes encoding enzymes that chemically modify the drug, either by phosphorylation, adenylylation or acetylation. By far the most prevalent of these mechanism is N-acetylation, catalyzed by a wide range of enzymes that exhibit regioselective acetylation. We are actively studying both the M. tuberculosis 2’-acetyl-transferase, that can uniquely catalyze both 2’-O- and N-acetylation, and the S. enterica 6’-acetyltransferase (regioselectivity of the reaction shown at right).
 The structures of these enzymes in complex with CoA and ribostamycin has allowed us to define the molecular basis for the observed regioselectivity. Both of these enzymes are chromosomally-encoded, suggesting that they have evolved their antibiotic-modifying activity from an extant, but unknown, activity. Protein N-acetyltransferases The aforementioned studies have led us to an examination of the GNAT superfamily of N-acetyltransferases, of which both the prokaryotic aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases and eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases are members. Of the twenty-six GNAT superfamily members in E. coli, only one has been expressed and functionally characterized, three are ribosomal protein N-acetyltransferases, and the other 22 have unknown function. These small (120-200 aa) enzymes can be identified from four sequence motifs that represent the core “fold” of the N-acetyltransferases, of which some 10,000 superfamily members can be identified in sequenced genomes. The known monomer fold structures are nearly identical, and represent an acetyl-CoA binding domain.
The specificity for the acetylatable substrate is determined both by residues of the monomer, but also by residues at the dimer interface, which are vastly different for different GNAT’s. The determination of the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes, and their ability to N-acetylate both small molecules, peptides and proteins suggests that these enzymes have have multiple substrates and physiological functions. In order to determine the physiological substrates for the genomic ensemble of GNAT’s, we have developed a method and reagent which has allowed us to covalently modify the substrate of any acetyltransferase. The reagent, chloroacetyl-CoA (ClAcCoA) is a substrate for the acetyltransferase, and the chloroacetyl group is transferred to the substrate to generate the chloroacetylated product. The other product, CoASH, is a potent nucleophile, which attacks the a-chloroacetylated product to generate an acetyl-CoAylated substrate. When [3’-32P]-ClAcCoA is used, the product of the reaction becomes radiolabeled, and for protein substrates, can be observed after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We have shown that this reagent can be used to label ribosomal protein L12 in the presence of the rimL-encoded N-acetyltransferase.
We have also demonstrated that exogenously added thiol-containing compounds containing both fluorecent probes and affinity labels can be used to identify both the known protein substrates of N-acetyltransferases and other unknown substrates in cell extracts. We wish to expand these studies to include the identification of all the substrates for all the N-acetyltransferases in both Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have also recently demonstrated that the yeast Hat1 histone acetyltransferase will use ClAcCoA as a substrate, and will selectively chloroacetylate histones H3 and H4 in a mixture of yeast histones. We now believe that the reagent will be useful in defining the expanding manifold of eukaryotic transcription factors whose acetylation status, like those of the histones themselves, regulates transcription and the activity and stability of the eukaryotic transcription apparatus.
 Finally, we are developing new methods to identify the large number of proteins that are known to be post-translationally modified by lipidation, including both myristoylation and palmitoylation. Suitability for Undergraduate, Graduate and Postdoctoral Trainees The projects described above are eminently suitable for all levels of scientific trainees. Although the laboratory today has a preponderance of postdoctoral fellows, and a single graduate student, summer undergraduate students have participated in the research program and been co-authors in a number of published works. Undergraduate students with an interest in biological chemistry, and a strong background in organic and physical chemistry, would be especially qualified to participate in the research program.

It’s one thing to have Ultimate Questions or something similar to freely hand out to anyone, but what do you give to the thinking, serious person who is wrestling with the Christian faith and its relationship to the meaning of life? John Blanchard provides the answers in this new book, written for Christians to give to enquirers. Dr Blanchard deals with the scientific and philosophical issues in his inimitable style, leading at the heart of the book to a fullorbed presentation of the glories of the gospel.
Professor Sinclair Ferguson says:
						"You can trust John Blanchard. In addition to the sheer clarity of what he writes, he is honest and he is gracious. At no point will you find yourself asking, ‘What is he trying to say!’ Nothing here is dull, merely ordinary or interesting. He has that special gift if being insatiably curious about things, and - this is his genius - he always seems to be asking if and how and why things happen. Why are you here? will help you to connect the dots so that the big picture,although composed of seemingly endless millions of facts, really does begin to make sense."
Dan Walker, presenter of BBC Television’s Football Focus adds:
						The journalist in me loves asking the ‘big’ questions.
					Mine are normally posed to famous faces who have just met with triumph or disaster or are preparing to. I love getting the answers.
There are some questions in life that are REALLY important though and they don’t come much more significant than ‘Why are we here’?
It’s a subject which gets to the heart of what makes us tick, keeps us going, governs out relationships and dictates what happens both during life and after death. It sounds serious doesn’t it? Thankfully John Blanchard has an incredible ability to strip away the guff, cut through the rubbish, and point towards the light.
This is a book that will make you think hard about what you consider to be true and, if the author is right, it’s life-changing life-affirming truth. That has got to be worth some of your precious time.
Available from all good Christian bookstores or from sales@10ofthose.com.

              Abstract




Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a clinically significant problem that threatens current paradigms of antibacterial chemotherapy. This is particularly true for the treatment of tuberculosis, where singly- and multiply-drug resistant clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been identified with increasing frequency. Very few compounds are selective antimycobacterial agents, and mycobacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics either because of the constitutive expression of degrading enzymes (e.g., Beta-lactamases) or the inability of antibiotics to penetrate the uniquely hydrophobic outer cell wall. The principal investigator and his group have previously focused their attention on the DAP/L-lysine biosynthetic pathway, and will use similar approaches to explore the three-dimensional structures and chemical mechanisms of M. tuberculosis enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pantothenate, a vitamin in mammals, and an essential pathway in M. tuberculosis. Specifically, they will clone, express and purify the M. tuberculosis ilvGM, ilvC and ilvD gene products involved in branched chain and pantothenate biosynthesis, and the panB gene product involved in pantothenate biosynthesis. They will clone, express and purify the M. tuberculosis dxs- and dxr-encoded deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase and isomeroreductase for mechanistic comparison to the ilvC- and ilvGM-encoded enzymes. They will also determine the structures and chemical mechanisms of aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases, enzymes that are primarily responsible for clinical resistance to aminoglycosides in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. These enzymes catalyze a rich variety of chemistries, and plausible chemical mechanisms suggest that mechanism-based, and bi- and tri-substrate analogue inhibitors might be found. They will continue to use an integrated approach involving kinetic and chemical mechanism studies, three-dimensional structural studies, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify active site residues important for substrate and inhibitor recognition, and fulfill their long term goal of characterizing unique bacterial multi-step biosynthetic pathways that are absent in humans.

Gold
Civilizations have equated gold with gods, wealth, and immortality. For centuries, gold has symbolized power and used as a storage of wealth. The fact that gold neither corrodes nor tarnishes not to mention the beauty of the precious metal made it suitable for deities and royalty in ancient civilizations. A gold standard was used as a monetary policy within and between nations but the world gold standard ended in 1976. The 1930’s was the last time gold was used in minted coins designated for circulation. Historically, the value of gold was based on perceived rarity and its distinctive color.

Almost half of the new gold consumed each year is for jewelry, 40% is for investments and 10% for industry purposes. The high malleability and conductivity of gold are characteristics that make gold used in many types of computerized devices. The precious metal is also used in tooth restoration, as an anti-inflammatory, and infrared shields.
Paper currencies have come and gone but gold remains in demand and has an inherent value. Gold bars, coins, and Investment Grade Coins are all popular ways to invest in the yellow metal.

Gold Bars
Gold bars are the most popular way to invest in gold and generally the form of gold bullion that most people think about. A gold bar can come in a variety of sizes from 1 gram to 1 kilo. Actually, a gold bar can be as big as someone’s imagination. Currently, the largest gold bar in history was produced by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. The bar weighed 551 pounds and would be worth over $11 million with a spot price of $1275.

Investors prefer gold bars because they offer the most gold with a lower premium versus gold coins. Investors and collectors like gold coins and are willing to pay a higher premium due to the collectability of gold coins.
Gold Coins

Gold coins value is based on the weight of the precious metal and the scarcity of the coin itself. The scarcity arises from the fact that once a mintage of a coin is done for a specific year there will never be another coin of that year produced. Minted coins also offer the guarantee that comes from a reputable mint like the U.S. Mint. Gold coins are generally legal tender in the country that the coin was minted.

Investment Grade Coins

Investment Grade Coins are higher quality and more rare than bullion coins. These coins are also graded and are enclosed in a protective slab to ensure and preserve the condition of the coin. A study commissioned by the U.S. Congress has proven that certain Investment Grade Coins are shown to have an annual return of 15%. Investment Grade Coins are for investors planning to hold onto their investment for at least 3 years.
