We use only the highest quality herbs, 100% vegetarian (including the capsules), 100% herbs, absolutely no fillers.  Only the herbs, and nothing but the herbs.  We use organically grown and wildcrafted herbs to support your beloved pet's health.  Many of our formulas are 100% organic. The therapeutic effect of the plants is dependent on the plant's ability to retain the healing chemical compounds, and this is directly related to the growing environment.  If the soil is healthy and filled with natural nutrients, the herbs will have more potency.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
