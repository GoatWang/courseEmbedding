Online Security | Riverview Bank







































   














Your Security and Protection When Online 
 
Preventing  Cybercrime
Computer crime, also referred to as cybercrime, remains a big  concern for most people and businesses.  2016  did not present the same level and severity of system incursions, but the  election process and issues surrounding purported state sponsored hacking to  influence the election seems to have awakened many people.  That said, rest assured those going after  personal information are still there and working on their next big payday.  The financial losses experienced as a result  of cybercrime may range from minimum to catastrophic; the impact to a person’s  life can be devastating as they try to recover from identity theft.  There is no magic method to prevent cybercrime,  but there are critical steps that everyone can take to help prevent cybercrime  and avoid becoming a victim.  
Riverview Bank can’t  act as an advisor to you for your computer security.  However, our providing you some general tips  that may aid you when making decisions regarding your computer’s security and  bringing to your attention the need to be proactive regarding information  protection benefits everyone.  We do not  recommend any specific settings.  The  decision to accept and implement any of the security tips within this document  remains your individual decision.  The  Internet offers a tremendous amount of computer security information that you  should review periodically to see if you can improve your system’s  security.   We hope you find this  information helpful.
Passwords
          Yes, we all hate them, but when implemented correctly, they  help prevent others from accessing information we do not wish them to see or  have.  Consider requiring a password to  access your computer, particularly if it is a laptop or portable system.  Should it be lost or stolen, there is a  better chance your data may not be compromised.   Also, make sure the password you select is not easily guessed.  Use a mix of upper and lower case letters,  symbols, and numbers and make it at least eight characters long.  Generally, it is not a good idea to store  passwords on a file maintained on the system.   This would apply to mobile phone banking systems also.
Data Encryption
          Using one of the many and relatively inexpensive data  encryption packages renders your data useless to anyone that does not have the  “key” to decrypt the data.  Should you  chose to implement encryption on any system, make sure to keep the key in a  secure location that can be accessed should the need arise.   Otherwise, the data may be unrecoverable -  even to you.
Firewalls
          Most systems come with a software-based firewall available  and already installed.  The rules it  enforces depend on the security level you chose to implement.  Medium to High levels are better, but could  result in the denial of some inbound messages.   More importantly, make sure the firewall is turned on before connecting  your computer to the Internet.  There is  a very short time between connecting to the internet and becoming infected  unless proper precautions are in place.
Antivirus and Antispyware
          With malicious code in one of every 221 emails (as  determined by Symantec - 2015), it appears to be highly probable that your  system will face this threat at some point.   Make sure you install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software  to protect your systems.  This software  can also be scheduled to run automatically and both shorter daily scans and  more in-depth weekly scans should be implemented.  Make sure your mobile phone is protected as  there are more and more instances of malware and virus infections taking place  on those devices.  Make sure you only  install apps from trusted sources as rogue apps can easily compromise systems  and steal passwords and user IDs.  From  that point, the theft of your data and even bank account compromises are possible.  With the mobile banking from smartphones  gaining user adoption, rest assured, the “other side” will be working hard to  find the best way to access those devices to steal your money.
Wireless Connections
          Ensure that your wireless connection is secure.  Read the documentation that came with your  wireless access point and make sure encryption is set to WPA or WPA2.  WEP level encryption has been determined to  have flaws making it insecure.  Make sure  to change the default name of the system to something that will not easily identify  you.  Set the password to access the  device to a complex password as described above.  Your access point provider can assist with  implementing security in most cases.
Email Hazards
          Email from people you may or may not know, or recognize,  encouraging you to “click on a link” is a warning sign.  Clicking on the link could result in your  downloading malicious software and may compromise your system’s security.  If you were not expecting the communication,  you should not click on the attachments.   The same goes for downloading applications from unknown and untrusted  sites.  You may get all you want – and  more.
Public Computer Use
            Surfing the internet from a public computer is not  necessarily bad.   Unfortunately, the  user will normally have no knowledge of the security in place, if there is  any!    For that reason, you should never  access sites that require you to input your password as it, along with other  information, may be recorded.  If you  want the information to remain private, you may want to wait until you are on  your own or another system known to be secure.   Hotel, airport, and businesses offering free WIFI are certainly  convenient, but you never know if it is a site established by cybercriminal  solely to steal information.
Smart Phones and PDAs
            Consider implementing the password lock to protect your  device and the information on it should it be lost or stolen.  These types of devices are now frequently  used to house a lot of personal and even financial information.  This has not gone unnoticed by  criminals.  Similar protective software  on these devices to that on your home systems may be necessary to provide  adequate security.  If you use mobile  banking, you may want to determine what mobile security is available to  you.  Where possible, use a wired phone  or secured connection to transmit confidential information such as banking  information or social security numbers.          
Data Backups
          Most people acquire a computer at some point and use if for  numerous purposes.  The replacement of a  computer is pretty easy.  Sadly, the  recovery of data you store on the computer may not be so easy.  Therefore, having a recent backup copy of  your data is a good practice.  With the  increase of data hijacking for ransom, you will be glad you have a copy of your  data rather than have to pay a fee to “maybe” get it back.   How  often you backup your system should be related to the value of the information  it contains – and what its loss would mean.
Unknown Data Storage Devices
          Many USB thumb drives have been lost, and many found.  People who find them seem to be curious as to  their contents and plug them in to their system to see what is on the  drives.  Imagine, if you will, a number  of thumb drives loaded with self-extracting virus software, Trojan  applications, or other malware being placed near a business office.  Staff members find these devices, plug them  in to their office PC, and the software infects their system and spreads  throughout the company network.  Once  installed, the software makes an outbound connection and the system is then further  exploited.   Destroying these devices, if  found, is a better practice. 
Systems Disposal
          Just because you decide to dispose of your computer, the  data you had on it does not magically disappear.  You can obtain software that will scrub the  data from the drive.  If you really want  to protect any possible data, remove the hard drive and destroy it yourself.  Better to be sure your data is no longer on  the system then sell it to someone and later discover your data was  compromised.
Stay Aware
          Remain aware and question anything that is not normal.  Changes in the way an application functions,  inability to access certain files, and worse yet, suspicious account activity  could all mean your system has been compromised.   Take action to determine what has  happened.   If you determine your system  has been compromised and do not feel capable of correcting the issue, seek help  to minimize the damage and prevent further spreading of any virus or malware.
Education
          The internet is constantly updated with information relative  to protecting computer resources and information.  Locate a few sites that provide information  on threats and make it a practice to visit them frequently.  You may be enlightened and able to take  protective action to avoid becoming a victim of a cybercrime.
Social Media
          What an explosion of offerings has taken place.  The wonder years of America On Line (AOL)  have become, Snapchat, Linkedin, Twitter, and Facebook, etc.   While the services offered with these social  media services can be good, make sure your use of them does not put you at  risk.  Pay attention to security settings  and what they mean.  Do not be overly  giving with birthdates, ages, locations, or other information that can be used  to build a profile of you that may be used for identity theft.  Keep in mind, what other people post about  you on their sites can reveal things that you may not want publically known.  There are guides on the Internet to assist  you with security for these services. 

Get More Information
            For additional information on phishing and identity theft, go to the Federal  Trade Commission's Website at www.ftc.gov.  There is a lot of good information available  there to assist you in protecting yourself and your assets.

Riverview Financial Corporation and Union Bancorp, Inc. Announce Definitive Agreement and Plan of Consolidation
 Marysville, PA,  March 08, 2013 --(PR.com)-- Riverview Financial Corporation (“Riverview”) (OTCQB: RIVE), the holding company for Riverview Bank, and Union Bancorp, Inc. (“Union”) (OTCQB: UBPT), the holding company for Union Bank and Trust Company, jointly announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement to consolidate their respective holding companies and merge their bank subsidiaries. The resulting bank is anticipated to have approximately $450 million in total assets and will operate under the name of Riverview Bank, and its operating divisions, Halifax Bank, Marysville Bank, and Riverview Financial Wealth Management.Under the terms of the definitive agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each company, Riverview and Union will consolidate to form a new holding company that will do business under the Riverview name. The shareholders of Union will receive 1.95 shares of common stock of the newly created holding company for each share of Union common stock that they own, and the shareholders of Riverview will receive 1.00 shares of common stock of the new holding company for each share of Riverview common stock that they own. As a result of the transaction, Union’s shareholders are expected to own approximately 36% of the combined company, and Riverview’s shareholders are expected to own approximately 64%.The agreement contains customary provisions that limit the ability of Union to terminate the Agreement in order to pursue a competing transaction and a requirement that Union pay a break-up fee to Riverview in certain events. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, the approval of the shareholders of each institution and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.Robert M. Garst will serve as the CEO, and Kirk D. Fox will serve as the President, of the new holding company. The Board of the resulting holding company will initially consist of sixteen members, eleven from the existing Riverview board and five from the existing board of Union Bancorp.Due to identical operating systems and common operating methodologies, the companies currently expect substantial cost savings resulting from this transaction, along with meaningful synergies after the effective date.In jointly announcing this transaction, Robert M. Garst, Chief Executive Officer of Riverview Financial Corp., and Mark F. Ketch, Chief Executive Officer of Union Bancorp, Inc., stated that “By combining the strengths of our companies, we are creating an institution with significantly greater scale, opportunity, and potential to generate additional value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. We believe there are exceptional synergies that can be achieved as a result of this combination.” Both executives noted that a larger entity is better positioned to effectively compete and address the continuing pressure on net interest margin and growing compliance related expenses associated with increasing regulation.Garst explained “Given the current trends in the financial services industry, it is critically important to secure solid partnerships to continue to thrive in this era of increasing earnings pressure. Both Boards of Directors firmly believe this combination will enhance shareholder value through improved earnings and the opportunity for increased dividends and common stock liquidity. We anticipate our combined entity can offer more diverse and progressive services and products, and create substantial cost efficiencies beyond what either company could achieve standing alone. This transaction is possible because both Boards of Directors and management teams share the same strategic vision and culture that emphasizes customer service and local decision making as methods of enhancing shareholder value.”Garst went on to point out that “this is an ‘in-market’ merger with very limited office overlap, creating enhanced market share position and an expanded retail office network for both existing and new customers within existing markets.” Ketch agreed, stating that “Union Bank has a significant and meaningful legacy within its current market. This combination allows us to build upon the rich history of the Union franchise while allowing us to remain focused on the communities we serve.”Ambassador Financial Group, Inc. served as financial advisor to Riverview Financial, and Barley Snyder, LLP served as its legal counsel. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. served as financial advisor to Union, and Rhoads & Sinon, LLP served as its legal counsel.About Riverview Financial CorporationRiverview Financial Corporation is the parent company of Riverview Bank, a community bank currently operating 10 full service banking offices in Dauphin, Cumberland, Schuylkill, and Perry Counties, and 1 dedicated wealth management office in Schuylkill County.About Union Bancorp, Inc.Union Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Union Bank and Trust Company, which operates 6 full service banking offices and 1 dedicated trust and commercial banking office in Schuylkill and Northumberland Counties.Additional Information About the TransactionRiverview and Union intend to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a joint proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant materials in connection with the consolidation. The joint proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to the shareholders of Riverview and Union. The joint proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant materials (when they become available) filed with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.Shareholders are urged to read the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other relevant materials when they become available before voting on the consolidation. The foregoing description of the definitive agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreement which will be included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. The definitive agreement is not intended to provide any other factual information about Riverview, Union, or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the definitive agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Riverview, Union, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by Riverview or Union.Riverview, Union and their respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees may be deemed “participants” in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders of Riverview and Union in favor of the consolidation. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be considered participants in the solicitation of the shareholders of Riverview and Union in connection with the proposed consolidation will be set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus when it is filed with the SEC.This press release may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and trends could differ materially from those set forth in such statements due to various factors which include, but are not limited to, factors that will be discussed in the proxy statement/prospectus. Such factors include the possibility that the proposed transaction may not be completed, anticipated cost savings may not be realized, estimated synergies may not occur, increased demand or prices for the combined companies’ financial services and products may not occur, technological developments, ineffectiveness of business strategy due to changes in current or future market conditions; the effects of changes in laws and regulations on competition, including industry consolidation and development of competing financial products and services; interest rate movements; difficulties in integrating distinct business operations, including information technology difficulties; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and employees, and challenges in establishing and maintaining operations in new markets; volatilities in the securities markets; and deteriorating economic conditions. Neither Riverview nor Union undertakes, and both specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of one or both of them.For Further Information, please contact:Robert M.

Riverview Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results
Jul 19, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
HARRISBURG, Pa., July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riverview Financial Corporation (“Riverview”) (OTCQX:RIVE), the financial holding company for Riverview Bank, today reported unaudited financial results at and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.  Riverview reported net income of $179 thousand, or $0.04 per basic and diluted weighted average common share, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $855 thousand, or $0.27 per basic and diluted weighted average common share, for the comparable period of 2016.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, Riverview reported a net loss of $388 thousand, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted weighted average common share, compared to net income of $1,608 thousand, or $0.50 per basic and diluted weighted average common share, for the same period last year. The net loss recognized for the first six months of 2017 was a direct result of incurring certain costs related to implementing strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value through asset growth provided by organic and inorganic opportunities. On January 20, 2017, we announced the successful completion of a $17.0 million private placement of common and preferred securities. The additional capital afforded us the ability to significantly grow our loan portfolio through hiring multiple teams of experienced and established lenders to serve new and existing markets. More notably the capital raise allowed us to announce on April 20, 2017, the execution of a definitive merger agreement in which Riverview Financial Corporation will merge with CBT Financial Corp., the parent company of CBT Bank, in a stock transaction valued at approximately $49.4 million.  This merger will form a combined community banking franchise with approximately $1.2 billion of assets and will provide enhanced products and services through 33 banking locations covering 12 Pennsylvania counties. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. “We look forward to the pending strategic partnership with CBT Financial Corp. along with obtaining the benefits derived from the merger for shareholders, customers and employees. We are confident that the shareholders of both entities will recognize the exceptional value created through the combination of two community banks having long established histories of providing excellent service and extensive community support to Central and Southwestern Pennsylvania. This move is a logical step in our announced strategy to expand throughout Central Pennsylvania and into markets with attractive demographics and long-term growth potential. The addition of our new lending teams has provided net loan growth of more than $40.3 million in the second quarter and $95.4 million for the first half of 2017,” stated Kirk D. Fox, Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we are pleased to announce our entrance into Lycoming County as we expect to open our first community banking office located in Williamsport, PA during the third quarter of 2017,” concluded Fox.   HIGHLIGHTS For the second quarter of 2017, loans, net grew 34.8% annualized.Deposits increased $27.4 million or 22.1% annualized to $523.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017 from $496.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017.Stockholders’ equity increased $15.6 million to $57.5 million or 9.2% of total assets at June 30, 2017 as a result of the capital offering from December 31, 2016.Asset quality improved as nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans, net and other real estate owned declined to 1.41% at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.74% at March 31, 2017 and 2.35% at June 30, 2016. INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Tax-equivalent net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30 were $5.0 million and $9.5 million in 2017 compared to $4.5 million and $9.1 million in 2016, respectively.  The increase in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to a favorable volume variance from an increase in average interest earning assets exceeding the growth of average interest bearing liabilities. Partially offsetting the positive impact of net average asset growth was an unfavorable rate variance caused by a decline in the tax-equivalent net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets exceeded the growth of average interest bearing liabilities by $21.8 million comparing the second quarters of 2017 and 2016. For the three months ended June 30, the tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.58% in 2017 from 3.75% in 2016. Average earning assets increased to $48.5 million compared to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of $26.3 million in the first half of 2017. Loans, net averaged $447.7 million in 2017 and $403.8 million in 2016. Average investments totaled $74.2 million in 2017 and $72.3 million in 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017, declined 19 basis points from 3.77% for the comparable period of 2016. The tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio decreased to 4.32% in the first half of 2017 compared to 4.50% in 2016. For the six months ended June 30, the tax-equivalent yield on total investments increased to 3.46% in 2017 from 3.30% in 2016. The cost of funds increased 11 basis points in 2017 from 0.54% in 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin increased slightly by one basis point to 3.58% in the second quarter of 2017 from 3.57% in the first quarter of 2017.  Average earning assets increased $51.3 million while average interest bearing liabilities increased $45.2 million comparing the second and first quarters of 2017. For the quarter ended June 30, the provision for loan losses increased to $519 thousand in 2017 from $156 thousand in 2016. The provision for loan losses totaled $1,124 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $255 thousand in 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily influenced by significant loan growth originated through the successful hiring of teams of lenders.   For the three months ended June 30, noninterest income totaled $802 thousand in 2017, a decrease of $251 thousand from $1,053 thousand in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net gains recognized on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities. Wealth management income grew $15 thousand while mortgage banking income grew $38 thousand when comparing the second quarter of 2017 with 2016. For the six months ended, noninterest income decreased to $1,581 thousand in 2017 from $1,690 thousand in 2016. The year over year decrease of $269 thousand in net gains recognized on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities was partially offset by improvements in wealth management income of $115 thousand. For the quarter ended June 30, noninterest expense increased $796 thousand to $5,041 thousand in 2017 from $4,245 thousand in 2016. Noninterest expense increased $1,844 thousand, or 22.1%, to $10,204 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from $8,360 thousand for the same period last year. The majority of the increase in salaries and employee benefit expense was the result of hiring new asset generation employees and related costs, as well as the opening of a new, full service office in Temple, Berks County, Pennsylvania. Additions to leased facilities for these newly opened offices along with offices to support the lending teams were primarily responsible for the $201 thousand or 18.6% increase in occupancy and equipment costs. The increase in other expenses comparing the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was a result of incurring merger related costs of $269 thousand in 2017. BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Total assets, loans, net and deposits totaled $628.2 million, $504.8 million, and $523.9 million, respectively, at June 30, 2017. Loans, net increased $40.3 million, or 8.7% in the second quarter of 2017 and $95.4 million or 23.3% for the first half of 2017. Growth in commercial loans was primarily responsible for the majority of the improvement. Total deposits increased $27.4 million or 5.5% in the second quarter of 2017 and $71.3 million or 15.8% in the first six months of 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.2 million, while interest-bearing deposits increased $69.1 million in the first half of 2017. An improvement in the volume of money market accounts was primarily responsible for the increase in interest-bearing deposits. Stockholders’ equity totaled $57.5 million or $11.79 per common share at June 30, 2017, as compared to $41.9 million, or $12.95 per common share at December 31, 2016. The increase in equity in the first six months of 2017 was a result of the completion of the sale of approximately $17.0 million in common and preferred equity, before expenses, to accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers through a private placement. Effective as of the close of business on June 22, 2017, Riverview filed an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to authorize a class of non-voting common stock after obtaining shareholder approval on June 21, 2017. As a result, each share of Series A preferred stock was automatically converted into one share of non-voting common stock as of the effective date. The non-voting common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects with, each other yeah i think she'd be great at training  except that holders of non-voting common stock do not have voting rights. Tangible stockholders’ equity per common share decreased to $10.51 per share at June 30, 2017, compared to $10.84 per share at year-end 2016. Dividends declared for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $0.28 per share. The annualized dividend yield based on the closing price of $13.48 per share on June 30, 2017 was 4.1%. ASSET QUALITY REVIEW Nonperforming assets were $7.1 million or 1.4% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at June 30, 2017, an improvement from $8.1 million, or 2.0%, at December 31, 2016, and $9.4 million, or 2.4% at June 30, 2016. Adjusting for accruing restructured loans, non-performing assets were $1.9 million, or 0.4% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at June 30, 2017, $2.4 million or 0.6% at December 31, 2016, and $2.8 million, or 0.7%, at June 30, 2016. The allowance for loan losses equaled $4.8 million or 0.96% of loans, net at June 30, 2017, compared to $3.7 million or 0.91% of loans, net at December 31, 2016, and $3.6 million, or 0.91% of loans, net, at June 30, 2016. Loans charged-off, net of recoveries, for the three and six months ended June 30, equaled $14 thousand and $22 thousand in 2017, respectively, compared to $264 thousand and $1,011 thousand for the comparable periods last year.

Safe Harbor Forward-Looking Statements: We make statements in this press release, and we may from time to time make other statements regarding our outlook or expectations for future financial or operating results and/or other matters regarding or affecting Riverview Financial Corporation, Riverview Bank, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Riverview”) that may be considered “forward-looking statements” as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “estimated,” “intend” and “potential.” For these statements, Riverview claims the protection of the statutory safe harbors for forward-looking statements. Riverview cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to: prevailing economic and political conditions, particularly in our market area; credit risk associated with our lending activities; changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation or practice with respect to tax or legal issues; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting Riverview’ operations, pricing, products and services and other factors that may be described in Riverview’ Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. In addition to these risks, acquisitions and business combinations present risks other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired. Acquisitions and business combinations may be substantially more expensive to complete than originally anticipated, and the anticipated benefits may be significantly harder-or take longer-to achieve than expected. As regulated financial institutions, our pursuit of attractive acquisition and business combination opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and/or legal issues related to the pre­acquisition operations of an acquired or combined business may cause reputational harm to Riverview following the acquisition or combination, and integration of the acquired or combined business with ours may result in additional future costs arising as a result of those issues. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, Riverview assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In addition to evaluating its results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), Riverview routinely presents and supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as tangible stockholders' equity and core net income ratios. The reported results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, contain items which Riverview considers non-core, namely net gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale and acquisition related expenses. Riverview presents the non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Riverview’s results of operation.  Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how Riverview evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluation of companies in Riverview’s industry. Where non-GAAP measures are used in this press release, reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures Riverview uses may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other financial institutions.  These non-GAAP financial measures would not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and Riverview strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are presented in the tabular material that follows.

The net loss recognized in the first quarter of 2017 was a direct result of incurring certain costs involved in implementing strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value through asset growth provided by organic and inorganic opportunities. On January 20, 2017, Riverview announced the successful completion of a $17.0 million private placement of common and preferred securities. The additional capital afforded Riverview the ability to significantly grow its loan portfolio through hiring multiple teams of experienced and established lenders to serve new and existing markets. More notably the capital raise allowed Riverview to announce on April 20, 2017, the execution of a definitive business combination agreement to form a strategic partnership with CBT Financial Corp. This action will form a combined community banking franchise with approximately $1.2 billion of assets and will provide enhanced products and services through 33 banking locations covering 12 Pennsylvania counties. "We are pleased with the success from the addition of our new lending teams growing loans by more than $55 million in the first quarter of 2017 and are extremely excited for shareholders, customers and communities with the announcement of the merger of CBT Financial Corp. with and into Riverview," stated Kirk D. Fox, Chief Executive Officer.

Deposits increased $43.9 million or 39.3% annualized to $496.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017 from $452.6 million at year-end 2016.   Stockholders' equity increased $15.2 million to $57.1 million or 9.5% of total assets at March 31, 2017 as a result of the capital offering.   Asset quality improved as nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans, net and other real estate owned declined to 1.74% at March 31, 2017 compared to 1.99% at December 31, 2016 and 2.44% at March 31, 2016.  INCOME STATEMENT REVIEWTax-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March 31, decreased $131 thousand to $4,487 thousand in 2017 from $4,618 thousand in 2016. The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to an unfavorable rate variance caused by a 22 basis point decline in the tax-equivalent net interest margin offset partially by a favorable volume variance from an increase in average interest earning assets and a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, declined to 3.57% from 3.79% for the comparable period of 2016. The tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio decreased to 4.30% in 2017 compared to 4.50% in 2016. Loans, net averaged $420.1 million in 2017 and $407.3 million in 2016. The majority of loan originations accounting for the net loan growth of $55.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 were closed at the end of the quarter. For the three months ended March 31, the tax-equivalent yield on total investments increased to 3.45% in 2017 from 3.36% in 2016. Average investments totaled $75.0 million in 2017 and $73.0 million in 2016. The cost of funds increased to 0.60% in 2017 from 0.53% in 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to $423.8 million in 2017 from $427.4 million in 2016.The provision for loan losses totaled $605 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $99 thousand in 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily influenced by significant loan growth originated through the successful hiring of teams of lenders. For the quarter ended March 31, noninterest income totaled $779 thousand in 2017, an increase of $142 thousand from $637 thousand in 2016. Wealth management income grew $100 thousand or 63.3% due to revenues from businesses acquired in 2016. In addition, service charges, fees and commissions and trust income improved $39 thousand and $11 thousand, respectively, comparing the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. The recognition of a sign on bonus from a credit card vendor was primarily responsible for the increase in service charges, fees and commissions. Mortgage banking income in 2017 remained at the amount recognized during the first quarter of last year despite recent increases in interest rates. Income of bank owned life insurance declined to $73 thousand in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $82 thousand for the comparable quarter of 2016.Read MoreNoninterest expense increased $1,048 thousand or 25.5%, to $5,163 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $4,115 thousand for the same period last year. The majority of the increase in salaries and employee benefit expense was a result of implementing the lending team lift out initiative and related costs, as well as the opening of a new, full service office in Temple, Berks County, Pennsylvania in the first quarter of 2017. Additions to leased facilities for this newly opened community banking office along with offices to support the lending teams were primarily responsible for the $93 thousand or 16.8% increase in occupancy and equipment costs. The majority of the $188 thousand increase in other expenses comparing the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 was a result of incurring professional fees related to the announced business combination with CBT Financial Corp.BALANCE SHEET REVIEWTotal assets, loans and deposits totaled $600.4 million, $464.5 million, and $496.5 million, respectively, at March 31, 2017. Loans, net increased $55.1 million or 13.5% comparing the end of the first quarter of 2017 to year end 2016 with commercial real estate loans being responsible for the majority of the improvement. Total investments were $72.7 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $73.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits increased $43.9 million or 9.7% in first three months of 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.2 million, while interest-bearing deposits increased $38.7 million. An improvement in the volume of money market accounts was primarily responsible for the increase in interest-bearing deposits.Stockholders' equity totaled $57.1 million or $12.45 per common share at March 31, 2017, and $41.9 million or $12.95 per common share at December 31, 2016. The increase in equity in the first quarter of 2017 was a result of the completion of the sale of approximately $17.0 million in common and preferred equity, before expenses, to accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers through the private placement of 269,885 shares of common stock and 1,348,809 shares of a newly created series of convertible, perpetual preferred stock. Tangible stockholders' equity per common share decreased to $10.65 per share at March 31, 2017, compared to $10.84 per share at year-end 2016. Dividends declared for the three months ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $0.14 per share. The annualized dividend yield based on the closing price on March 31, 2017 of $11.95 per share was 4.6%.ASSET QUALITY REVIEWNonperforming assets were $8.1 million or 1.7% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at March 31, 2017, an improvement from $8.2 million or 2.0% at December 31, 2016, and $9.8 million or 2.4% at March 31, 2016. Adjusting for accruing restructured loans, nonperforming assets were $2.5 million or 0.5% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at March 31, 2017, $2.4 million or 0.6% at December 31, 2016, and $3.2 million or 0.8% at March 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses equaled $4.3 million or 0.93% of loans, net at March 31, 2017, compared to $3.7 million or 0.91% of loans, net at December 31, 2016, and $3.7 million or 0.93% of loans, net, at March 31, 2016. Loans charged-off, net of recoveries, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, equaled $8 thousand or 0.01% of average loans, compared to $747 thousand or 0.74% of average loans for the same period last year.Riverview Financial Corporation is the parent company of Riverview Bank and its operating divisions Halifax Bank, Marysville Bank, Citizens Neighborhood Bank, and Riverview Wealth Management.

Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "should," "planned," "estimated," "intend" and "potential." For these statements, Riverview claims the protection of the statutory safe harbors for forward-looking statements.Riverview cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to: prevailing economic and political conditions, particularly in our market area; credit risk associated with our lending activities; changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation or practice with respect to tax or legal issues; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting Riverview' operations, pricing, products and services and other factors that may be described in Riverview' Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.In addition to these risks, acquisitions and business combinations present risks other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired. Acquisitions and business combinations may be substantially more expensive to complete than originally anticipated, and the anticipated benefits may be significantly harder-or take longer-to achieve than expected. As regulated financial institutions, our pursuit of attractive acquisition and business combination opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and/or legal issues related to the pre-acquisition operations of an acquired or combined business may cause reputational harm to Riverview following the acquisition or combination, and integration of the acquired or combined business with ours may result in additional future costs arising as a result of those issues.The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, Riverview assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.In addition to evaluating its results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), Riverview routinely presents and supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as tangible stockholders' equity and core net income ratios. The reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, contain items which Riverview considers non-core, namely net gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale and acquisition related expenses. Riverview presents the non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Riverview's results of operation. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how Riverview evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluation of companies in Riverview's industry. Where non-GAAP measures are used in this press release, reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures Riverview uses may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other financial institutions. These non-GAAP financial measures would not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and Riverview strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are presented in the tabular material that follows.[TABULAR MATERIAL FOLLOWS]      Summary Data   Riverview Financial Corporation   Five Quarter Trend   (In thousands, except per share data)                           March 31   Dec 31   Sept 30   Jun 30   March 31     2017   2016   2016   2016   2016   Key performance data:                                           Per common share data:                     Net income (loss) $ (0.12)   $ 0.15   $ 0.30   $ 0.27   $ 0.23   Core net income (loss) (1) $ (0.10)   $ 0.15   $ 0.27   $ 0.23   $ 0.25   Cash dividends declared $ 0.14   $ 0.14   $ 0.14   $ 0.14   $ 0.14   Book value $12.45   $12.95   $13.67   $13.57   $13.40   Tangible book value (1) $10.65   $10.84   $11.54   $11.40   $11.47   Market value:                       High $12.20   $11.78   $12.20   $12.10   $13.20     Low $11.46   $11.05   $11.00   $11.00   $11.00     Closing $11.95   $11.60   $11.40   $12.10   $11.10   Market capitalization $42,044   $37,559   $36,816   $38,973   $35,597   Common shares outstanding 3,518,351   3,237,859   3,229,467   3,220,934   3,206,927                         Selected ratios:                                           Return on average stockholders' equity (4.20)%   4.50%   8.73%   7.92%   7.08%                         Core return on average stockholders' equity (1) (3.70)%   4.50%   7.86%   6.85%   7.48%                         Return on average tangible stockholders' equity (1) (4.79)%   5.34%   10.36%   9.29%   8.28%                         Core return on average tangible stockholders' equity (1) (4.22)%   5.34%   9.33%   8.03%   8.76%                         Return on average assets (0.41)%   0.36%   0.73%   0.64%   0.56%                         Core return on average assets (1) (0.36)%   0.36%   0.66%   0.56%   0.59%                         Stockholders' equity to total assets 9.51%   7.72%   8.38%   8.29%   7.95%                         Efficiency ratio (2) 94.91%   82.02%   74.26%   79.80%   76.83%                         Nonperforming assets to loans, net, and foreclosed assets 1.74%   1.99%   2.15%   2.35%   2.44%                         Net charge-offs to average loans, net 0.01%   0.07%   0.00%   0.27%   0.74%                         Allowance for loan losses to loans, net 0.93%   0.91%   0.91%   0.91%   0.93%                         Earning assets yield (FTE) (3) 4.08%   4.19%   4.43%   4.22%   4.25%                         Cost of funds 0.60%   0.51%   0.51%   0.54%   0.53%                         Net interest spread (FTE) (3) 3.48%   3.68%   3.92%   3.68%   3.72%                         Net interest margin (FTE) (3) 3.57%   3.76%   3.99%   3.75%   3.79%                          (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures.

("CBT") (  OTC PINK :  CBTC ), headquartered in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, jointly announced today the execution of an agreement and plan of merger (the "Agreement") pursuant to which CBT will merge with and into Riverview in a transaction valued at approximately $50 million. The merger will form a combined community banking franchise with approximately $1.2 billion of assets and will provide enhanced products and services through 33 banking locations covering 12 Pennsylvania counties. Currently, Riverview operates 20 offices in Dauphin, Perry, Schuylkill, Berks, Somerset, Northumberland, Lycoming, and Lebanon county markets, and CBT operates 13 offices in Clearfield, Huntingdon, Blair, and Centre county markets. Under the terms of the Agreement, CBT shareholders will receive 2.86 shares of Riverview common stock in exchange for each share of CBT common stock. After the merger, Riverview shareholders are expected to own approximately 54% of the combined company and CBT shareholders are expected to own approximately 46% of the combined company. The board of directors of the combined company will be split evenly between Riverview and CBT directors. In addition, the combined company will move its headquarters to State College, Pennsylvania.The Chief Executive Officer of the combined entity will be Kirk Fox, current Chief Executive Officer of Riverview Financial, the President will be Brett Fulk, current President of Riverview Financial, and the Chief Operating Officer will be Michael Bibak, current President and Chief Executive Officer of CBT Financial."This merger of equals transaction creates a major central Pennsylvania franchise with bank assets exceeding $1 billion and wealth management assets under management of approximately $400 million," said Kirk D.

"Additionally, our combined talent and capital base will allow us to better serve legacy CBT and Riverview customers through higher lending limits, a wider range of products, improved technology and more banking locations." Fox went on to say "Riverview has spent considerable time and focus building a platform of talent, technology and other assets capable of achieving superior growth metrics despite a challenging environment.
