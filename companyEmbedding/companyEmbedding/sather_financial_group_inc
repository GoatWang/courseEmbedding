					Welcome			





The Sather Financial Group Inc. is a “fee-only” financial planning and investment management firm responsible for overseeing approximately $400 million in client assets.
It is our belief that a “fee-only” financial planning and investment management business is the best way to take care of clients, always putting their interests first. In this manner, no income is derived from commissions or any other type of transaction oriented activity. All fees are earned as a result of asset management fees. Given this, the goals of the Sather Financial Group, Inc. remain aligned with the clients.
As a Registered Investment Advisor, we function as a Fiduciary, not as a salesman. A Fiduciary is legally obligated to do what is in the client’s best interest, whereas a salesman (ie-stockbroker) attempts to sell a product--whether or not it is in the client’s best interest.
Given this structure, if our client’s assets increase in size we get a pay raise. Conversely, if our client’s assets shrink, we take a pay cut. This platform is the best way we know of to keep our goals aligned with our client’s. It motivates us to keep client’s commissions and taxes low and make decisions that lead to increased wealth.
The focus of the Sather Financial Group, Inc. is based upon offering; customized, individual financial planning and investment management.
In doing so each client has the opportunity to efficiently, and effectively, coordinate the following:
1. Investments
2. Taxes (derived from investment activity)
3. Insurance (home, health, life, auto, liability)
4. Estate Planning (wills, trusts, power of attorney or health care)
5. Retirement Plans
6. Asset Acquisition (vehicle or other property negotiations) 
Objectivity is obviously quite critical in developing a program that will take care of a client in the best manner possible. We don’t sell any type of product, fund family or work for any brokerage firm. The only person we represent is our client. As such, conflicts of interest are minimized.
Ultimately, the goal of the Sather Financial Group, Inc. is to take clients from point “A” today to point “B” in the future in the most logical and competent manner. In doing so, the clients’ interests are always put first.

Advisory Services and Fees
SFG earns its compensation by providing investment advisory and financial planning services. Fees are earned as a percentage of assets under management.
Investment management services fees are as follows:




Assets under Management
Annual Fee


0$ - $1,000,000
1.00%


$1,000,001 - $3,000,000
0.80%


$3,000,001 - $5,000,000
0.60%


$5,000,000 plus
0.40%



This is a tiered fee schedule such that a $1,000,000 account would have fees of $10,000 per annum, a $3,000,000 account would have fees of $26,000 per annum ($10,000 + $16,000), a $5,000,000 account would have fees of $38,000 per annum ($10,000 + $16,000 + $12,000).
A client who hires SFG for investment management services will also receive financial planning services as part of our program. The minimum account size for investment management services is $1,000,000 and the minimum annual fee is $10,000. In addition to the management fee for SFG’s services, the client is also responsible for, but not limited to, trading costs, commissions, mutual fund expenses and mark ups or mark downs.
Investment or Brokerage Discretion
SFG has the authority to determine, without obtaining specific client consent the securities to be bought or sold and the amount of the securities to be bought or sold. Â SFG does the majority of its trading through the institutional arm of Charles Schwab & Co. and TD AmeritradeDue to the size of the relationship that SFG has with Schwab and TD Ameritrade our clients trade stocks through Schwab and TD Ameritrade at a flat rate of $8 per trade and there are no trading fees for mutual funds in most cases.
Additional Compensation
SFG does not receive any forms of referral fees, commissions, rebates, 12b-1 fees or bonuses from any outside sources. The only compensation we receive is from our client and is fully disclosed.

Investing Principles
 
1.       We do not manage stocks. We manage the needs of our clients lives.
2.       Our clients who experience the best long term returns are the ones who continue to put more money into investments in all markets—whether good or bad. This is the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging. You cannot try to time the market and you must be willing to invest when the market is at peak levels of pessimism.
3.       Between 1986 and 2005 the S&P 500 produced gains of 11.9% per year. However, the average investor only received 3.9% per year over the same time period. Why? The average investor buys high and sells low chasing after the emotional decisions.
4.       Studies by Nobel Prize winner, William Sharpe, show that market timers must be right 82% of the time just to match the returns of an investor with a buy and hold strategy. Additionally, market timers incur approximately twice as much risk or volatility as the buy and hold strategy.
5.       90% of the returns of the market came from 1.5% of the days.
6.       Since 1834 the stock market has averaged about 10% per year. Also, it has incurred volatility (as measured by standard deviation) of about 15% per year. This means that on any given year you should reasonably expect your returns to be in a range of -5% to +25%. Although the average is 10% per year, the typical year is rarely average.
7.       Investment returns in excess of 20% to 25% annualized are unsustainable. Regression to the mean is a powerful force.
8.       Discipline is the premier investment virtue. Discipline is what keeps us from reacting impulsively and emotionally to what happens in our portfolios. It is a willingness to stick to a strategy during those temporary times it may be out of synch with the market.
9.       Although a stock certificate may be printed on a piece of paper, it represents much more. Whether you buy one share of stock or many shares of stock, you must function as if you own the entire company. Quite simply, that is what stock is—ownership in a company.
10.    The stock market is a long term proposition—meaning a ten plus year commitment. Even if you are 65 years old and are retired you should be a stock market investor with an appropriate amount of funds for the remainder of your life (which statistically is a very long time).
11.    If the volatility of the stock market is affecting your current standard of living then you have your assets invested incorrectly. The stock market should be utilized to produce long term (10+ years) growth in assets. Fixed income assets (C/D’s, Bonds, etc.) should be used to satisfy short to intermediate cash flow needs.
12.    Assume your dream home is selling for $400,000 and one day some guy on the TV says that because of a variety of scary sounding issues this dream home is now only worth $200,000. Most logical people would assess this discount as an opportunity to be pursued and buy their dream home. Only in the stock market have we witnessed people get so negatively excited when the prices of good quality companies are cut in half. I suppose this is due to people’s aversion to volatility and their inability to properly analyze the true value of a business. You must separate fear from opportunity.
13.    Over the past 50 years the broad stock market has lost as much as 35% in any one year. Conversely, over the same time period the stock market has gained as much as 56% in any one year. The average of these one year time periods has been 13%.
14.    Also, over the past 50 years the worst performance of the stock market over any five year time period has been a loss of 3.2% per year. The best five year gain has been 27% per year. The average of these one year time periods has been 11%. Time is your friend when dealing with the stock market and its short term volatility.
15.    Over the short term the stock market is merely a popularity contest that is quite irrational in nature. Long term, however, the stock market is a weighing machine which weighs the value (earnings) created by good companies that consistently increase their earnings.
16.    While the date of December 31st may have some meaning to you, it has no meaning to your investments. Do not become overly concerned with your investment performance as of this date or any other arbitrary date. Long term performance is what matters.
17.    Volatility and controversy create fear as well as opportunities. To take advantage of this you must embrace volatility and have a strong stomach.
18.    We own stocks personally and on behalf of our clients. We do so to participate, as owners of these companies, in their increasing pool of earnings.
19.    Most days there is a disconnect (often substantial) between a stocks price and the true value of their earnings or the company as a whole. A perfect example is Berkshire Hathaway. Even though Berkshire has increased its book value by 10% per year between 2002 and 2005, the stock price has done virtually nothing. The stock markets emotional disconnect does not sway us from owning one of the greatest companies, with arguably the greatest CEO of all time. Long term, Berkshire’s stock price will catch up to its increased book value and patient investors will benefit.
20.    Although we make predictions about developing trends, these trends take time to evolve. When we first started warning about over-valuation in tech and internet stocks in 1999 it took another year for these issues to become apparent. The same has been true for real estate. We first started verbalizing concerns about real estate in May of 2004. Only now are the flaws in real estate being openly discussed. Fortunately, our clients were positioned to avoid the tech disaster and are currently positioned to avoid any impending real estate wreck.
21.    Although the financial news focuses heavily on the stock market, we do not obsess over it. We constantly evaluate all investment categories relative to one another. However, stocks typically provide us with the best opportunities to outpace taxes and inflation.
22.    Inflation is a silent killer. You will never receive a bill for inflation and yet it has a bigger impact upon your assets than virtually anything else. With great consistency, the things we buy (food, energy, housing, etc.) go up in price. If your assets do not outpace taxes and inflation you lose purchasing power.
23.    Consider the following: a ten year U.S. Treasury bond (a default risk free investment) currently yields about 4.5%. In a 33% marginal income tax bracket our clients lose 1.5 of the possible 4.5 percentage points available leaving only 3 percentage points to deal with inflation. Currently, inflation is running in excess of 4% on an annual basis. Therefore, after factoring in the affects of inflation this seemingly “risk free” investment actually guarantees a negative 1% real rate of return. Bottom line: this safe U.S. Treasury bond investment can produce horrible long term results.
24.    Many of our more conservative clients experience unrealized losses in their accounts from time to time—not because of their stock market assets, but because of their fixed income assets. Investors must realize that when interest rates rise, bond prices will decline. Fixed income assets do not deliver the “safe” returns that many expect.
25.    For quite some time we have been discussing the need for foreign exposure. We live in a large global world and as such want our clients to participate in global capitalism. Most of our clients own stocks that sell more than 50% of their products outside of the United States. This provides us with tremendous international exposure via large mature and stable companies. We have also placed many clients into mutual funds that only invest outside of the U.S. This approach, along with owning U.S. based multi-nationals, provides clients with substantial global diversification.
26.    Most financial magazines, newspapers and TV shows are designed to sell advertising, newspapers etc.—not individually customized financial advice. Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money TV show is an idiot. His show is designed to elicit emotion and entertainment—not sound investment advice. Cramer’s ridiculous “Lightning Round” method of choosing investments is the financial equivalent of Russian Roulette—entertaining, but potentially catastrophic.
27.    All of our clients are different, with different goals, income needs, volatility constraints etc. To satisfy our client’s needs we constantly evaluate all types of investments for relative valuation, liquidity needs, income requirements, time frames, etc.
28.    We are honest with our clients even though it may not be what they want to hear. Our job is to look out for our clients with integrity and discipline.

Tax Reform Benefits America

by
Dave Sather

May 10, 2017






Tweet


















As soon as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin revealed the Trump Administration’s plan for tax reform, my phone rang. It was my older brother, Steve, wanting to know my thoughts on the proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to 15% from as high as 39%. 
He remembered that in the past, I had written an article that discussed how the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. However, Steve had read that U.S. corporations have a much lower average tax rate than 39%. As such, he wanted to know why the rate should be lowered if the average corporation already pays a much lower effective rate.
My brother’s observation is mathematically accurate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. has the highest top statutory tax rate of any G20 nation. However, the average corporate tax paid (total tax paid divided by income) was only 29%. As such, Steve wondered if it really made sense to lower the rate.
It’s a good question that requires some explanation.
First, companies are owned by shareholders, not nations. Every corporation has an obligation to their shareholders to pay their legally owed taxes—but not a penny more. As such, they have an obligation to operate in the most efficient locations.
Secondly, corporations today are global in nature—meaning they sell product worldwide. The average company in the S&P 500 derives nearly half of its income outside the U.S. This means their tax structure is anything but simple or straightforward. If they sell product outside the U.S., their average tax rate will be lower than the marginal rate assessed by the U.S. 
When companies sell product into a foreign country they are taxed in the jurisdiction in which the product is sold. 
Many countries, such as Ireland, Canada, France and the United Kingdom, have a corporate tax rate that is less than 20%. Since the U.S. rate is nearly twice as high it can be much more profitable for U.S. based companies to sell in these nations as it helps to maximize after-tax profits. 
However, the next step in global taxation is where the real confusion sets in. If a U.S.-based company sells product into England, for instance, they pay tax in England. 
After they settle up with the Brits, the net profits sit in a British bank account. If they bring the money back to the U.S., they are required to pay a 35% tax on the foreign derived profits—just for moving the cash from one bank account to another. This is a process called repatriation. 
Conversely, if they leave the cash sitting in a British bank, they can deploy 100% of it to expand foreign operations and hire foreign people. These foreign people then take their paychecks and spend them in their neighborhood, feed their families and expand their economy in the process. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. tax rates are so high in comparison that many corporations would rather keep their foreign-earned profits outside the U.S. This means they’re not re-investing those profits in the U.S. When profits are not reinvested, factories don’t get built, people aren’t employed and profits are not recirculated in a manner that stimulates our economy. This limits pay raises, opportunities for innovation and general advancement for the average family.
Given how wide this impact is, this is not a Republican or Democrat issue—it is an American issue. This, alone, should be enough to get any elected official to revisit our uncompetitive tax structure. However, there is even more “low hanging fruit” for anyone who wants to seriously attack this issue.
U.S. corporations currently hold $2.6 trillion in foreign bank accounts.
By lowering the tax rate to 15%, hopefully a significant portion of these foreign-held assets will find their way home…and in the process, serve as feedstock for innovation, employment and GDP expansion right here at home.

Asset Rich, Cash Flow Poor

by
Dave Sather

March 28, 2012

Dave Sather's Money Matters
Lately, we’ve had numerous conversations with clients, as well as others, who have found themselves “asset rich and cash flow poor”.

They have put themselves in this predicament by owning illiquid real estate assets.
Often, these illiquid assets are from privately formed real estate partnerships which come with a slick sales pitch offering attractive cash flows at a time when traditional interest income continues to be pathetically low. With money markets and C/D’s offering less than 1% interest the thought of earning 8% or more sounds too good to be true—and it usually is.
More than likely, the assets appeared sound and the buyer relied on the advice they received at the time. However, often that “advice” is motivated by a large commission that the selling broker stands to receive if you bite.
Furthermore, many investors in these partnerships later realize that the big “cash flow” they received was not “interest” income but rather a combination of interest and return of principal. Given this, the check you receive may be very deceptive in terms of its actual rate of return.
Although the majority of the concerns we currently hear about involve private real estate partnerships put together by brokers, there are many other examples of assets with similar issues. Whether it is a private business, acreage, or even your house there are many issues to evaluate and consider.
For instance, many illiquid assets are hard to value and even harder to find a buyer for--especially when time is of the essence.
Think for a moment just how different shares of Coca-Cola stock are when compared with any illiquid asset. This past Friday there were 8.1 million shares of Coca-Cola that traded hands. As such, an owner of Coke stock can rest assured that if they need to sell their shares there will be many willing people vying to buy their asset. The same is not true for the illiquid assets. Sales may take months to complete and even then, due to a lack of competing offers, you may be forced to sell for a fraction of what an asset should be worth. As such, in a pinch which would you rather own?
Buying illiquid assets can compound the liquidity trap that many retirees are now facing. Their single biggest asset is a house that cannot be used for cash flow and is illiquid. Consider an individual homeowner who allocates a significant portion of their remaining savings to other illiquid assets—and then something unforeseen occurs. They have very little room to maneuver and their financial picture can quickly become a house of cards.
Obviously, the fact that an asset is not publicly traded does not mean you should run for the hills. However, some common sense is warranted. Don’t fall for something just because of a good sales pitch and don’t fall in love with an asset. If someone is actively selling you a product of this nature ask many questions and get the responses in writing. Furthermore, recognize that if you invest in a non-publicly traded asset you need to be very confident that you have a very long time frame to hold that asset.
Finally, remember that the world’s greatest investment ideas may never be profitably completed if you don’t have the necessary cash flow in the meantime or if you don’t have other financial resources that allow you to be sufficiently patient.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
