William P. Wood - Wikipedia





















 






William P. Wood

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

William Patrick Wood (March 11, 1820 – March 20, 1903) was the first Director of the United States Secret Service. He was the son of James Wood and Margaret Turner.
He was sworn in on July 5, 1865 by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. He then headed the newly formed Secret Service for four years until he resigned in 1869. Wood was a veteran of the Mexican-American War and was once Keeper of the Old Capitol Prison. He was considered the best in battling financial crime, and within a year of its founding, the Secret Service had arrested over 200 counterfeiters. He died on March 20, 1903, and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher Comments Bestselling author William Wood spins this dark, riveting tale of a beloved Sacramento cop killed in a bizarre accident, and the hunt to track down his killer—a fast-paced thriller of murder, deceit, haunting pasts, and one mans dangerous scheme to fight for those he loves.  Officer Tommy Ensor did not see the car that struck him down on a rainy night in Californias capital.  Ensor is no ordinary cop. Hes a hero, winner of the Medal of Valor, devoted family man and coach, helping at-risk kids. But the driver who struck him down and didnt stop isnt ordinary either. Hes Judge Frank Stevenson, up-and-coming member of the bench, also devoted to his wife and daughter, involved in charities and good works. In a split second he did something completely uncharacteristic that irrevocably changes his life and the lives of everyone close to him.  Terry Nye is a couple of weeks from retirement as a detective, head of Major Crimes. Hes trying to pack thirty years of bloody experiences and hard lessons into those two weeks for his new partner, Rose Tafoya. Rose is a young detective, smart, more than a little ambitious, but also insecure. Together she and Nye are a powerhouse team. Hes determined to find Ensors assailant and hes going to make sure Rose doesnt make the same mistakes he did, especially the unforgivable one that has come back to darkly haunt him after Ensors accident.  The city is in turmoil when Ensor dies and the hunt for a cop killer rushes ahead relentlessly, moving from Nye and Tafoya to Stevenson and his wife. The guilty and innocent are sucked randomly into the intense, high-powered investigation. Nye and Rose face death in a shoot-out; a politicians sad, dirty secret is exposed; and ambitions threaten to destroy the investigation.  The hunters and the hunted know the stakes are life and death.  Frank Stevenson knows hes being hunted. Stevenson is both stunned because he didnt stop that rainy night and steeled to do whatever he has to do to avoid the hunters. Even if it means committing more crimes. Hes not just protecting himself. Hes fighting for those he loves.  Stevenson comes up with a brilliant scheme to throw Nye and Tafoya off the track. But even if it works, Stevenson is tormented wondering how he can sit in judgment on others now.   A final hard moment of reckoning arrives for the hunters and the hunted. Everyone will realize that their lives will change in the blink of an eye.  Review"A character-driven novel that makes you stop and think about things most people take for granted. When everyone is the good guy, who do we root for, and are we all capable of being the bad guy? I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes thought-provoking books." --Madderly ReviewReview “No one writes a better police procedural than Bill Wood, and Sudden Impact is his best one to date—lucid prose, meticulous legal detail, and unforgettable characters struggling in various moral quandaries. Terrific, unputdownable stuff.” —John Lescroart, New York Times bestselling author of The Thirteenth Juror and The Hunt Club  “William Wood is a master of suspense. Sudden Impact is Wood at the peak of his powers, tense and eloquent, with characters and a story of political intrigue and riveting tragedy.” —Steve Martini, New York Times bestselling author   “Wood clearly knows the inner workings of the judicial system.” —Publishers Weekly   “A feeling of truth permeates this book . . . one of the better courtroom dramas of recent years.” —New York Times, for Rampage   “The story never cools down and never plays tricks.” —Kirkus Reviews   “The nonstop action and relentless pace will satisfy fans of the hard-boiled thriller genre.” —Publishers Weekly, for Gangland   “A spellbinding tale about the men and women who dispence justice from the bench.” —Associated Press, for Broken Trust   “William P. Wood . . . knows the intricacies and ironies of the legal system. He also knows how to employ them to weave a compelling story.” —San Diego Union, for Stay of Execution        About the Author WILLIAM WOOD is the bestselling author of eight novels and one nonfiction book. As a deputy district attorney in California, he handled thousands of criminal cases and  put on over 50 jury trials. Two of Woods novels have been produced as motion pictures, including Rampage, filmed by Academy Award winning director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist, Rules of Engagement), and Broken Trust, filmed by Jane Fonda Films with the screenplay written by Joan Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne. Woods books have been translated into several foreign languages including French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Greek, and Polish. He lives in Sacramento, California.

William P. Wood













                    
                    WILLIAM P. WOOD is the author of nine thrillers and one nonfiction book. As a deputy district attorney in California, he handled thousands of criminal cases ranging from disturbing the peace to murder. He served as chief counsel to the Secretary of State of California, the Commissioner of the California Department of Corporations, and the Undersecretary of the Office of Secretary of State.Wood's literary works include "Rampage" (1985), "Gangland" (1988), Fugitive City (1989), "Court of Honor" (1991), "Stay of Execution" (1994), "Quicksand" (1998), "Pressure Point" (2004), and "The Bribe" (2006). His latest book is "Sudden Impact." A nonfiction book, "The Bone Garden" (1994), is the definitive account of serial killer Dorothea Puente, who was the subject of a nationwide hunt after nine bodies were dug up from her Sacramento, California yard. Wood earlier sent Puente to prison for drugging and robbing the elderly. On her release from prison, she began killing her victims. "The Bone Garden" has been referenced in multiple books and featured on TV.Many of Wood's novels have been optioned for motion pictures, two of which were produced. The first, "Rampage," was directed by Academy Award-winner William Friedkin ("The French Connection" and "The Exorcist"). "Court of Honor" was adapted into the TNT movie "Broken Trust" by Jane Fonda Films. It starred Tom Selleck and Elizabeth McGovern. The screenplay was written by Joan Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne.To date, Wood's books have been translated into French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Greek, and Polish. He is currently at work on his next book. For more details, visit www.williampwoodbooks.com.

A Forgotten Sleuth Is Honored at Last

By CARL HULSEMAY 29, 2001

For almost a century, visitors to historic Congressional Cemetery could come across the grave of William P. Wood, a soldier and sleuth who was the first chief of the Secret Service, and not have a clue who was buried there.The grave of Mr. Wood, a Civil War-era personality whose exploits were the stuff of adventure novels, was marked by only a simple piece of granite engraved with his surname. He died almost penniless in 1903 after a dispute with the government over rewards he claimed.Now, retired members of the Secret Service, which Mr. Wood helped instill with commitment, have come together to make sure that their first director is remembered.A donated black granite headstone that identifies Mr. Wood as the first chief of the Secret Service, the commandant of the Old Capitol Prison and a veteran of the Civil War and the Mexican War, will be dedicated on Wednesday, the traditional Memorial Day, at a ceremony attended by the current director and former ones, retired agents and other Washington officials.

''We think it is fitting to take the time to acknowledge our first director, the work he has done and what an influential figure he was, not only in our organization but also in the history of our country,'' said Brian L. Stafford, the current director of the Secret Service, the agency's 20th. Continue reading the main story

To some retired agents involved in the memorial project, it is particularly important to give their founding chief his due considering that another giant in law enforcement --  J. Edgar Hoover, longtime director of the F.B.I. -- is buried nearby in a much more grandiose setting.''There is even a bench to sit there and think about how wonderful Mr. Hoover was,'' said Richard T. Race, a member of the Association of Former Agents of the U.S. Secret Service and one of those instrumental in securing the Wood stone.While Mr. Wood is little known these days, he was prominent in Washington in the late 1800's, handpicked to head the law enforcement agency that President Lincoln agreed to create the very day he was shot at Ford's Theater.Though the Secret Service is recognized today mainly as the protector of presidents, its original mission -- and still a mission -- was to stamp out counterfeiting, which was rampant during and after the Civil War, when as much as one-third of the nation's currency was fake.The July 1, 1865, Treasury Department order appointing Mr. Wood told him that his primary responsibility was ''detecting and bringing to trial and punishment, persons engaged in counterfeiting treasury notes, bonds and other securities of the United States.''

Mr. Wood was thought to be a good choice for the job because of his previous work as superintendent of the Old Capitol Prison, a Civil War jail for spies and provocateurs, which stood on land now occupied by the Supreme Court building.''He was not a newcomer to crime and the criminal mind,'' a Secret Service history noted.He was known as a dogged investigator and interrogator. In perhaps his biggest currency case, the arrest of William Brockaway, the master counterfeiter, he questioned the suspect for five days before getting a confession. Colonel Wood, as he was called then, also investigated the Lincoln assassination and secured confessions in that case as well. A contemporary sketch of Mr. Wood depicts a tough, square-jawed man who looks capable of investigative techniques that might not pass modern legal muster.''I don't know if he would cut it as director today,'' Mike Sampson, the Secret Service archivist, said. ''He was kind of gruff around the edges. But when they were starting out, they wanted a no-nonsense guy.''

The establishment of the Secret Service was just one of Mr. Wood's accomplishments. He was described as a daring cavalry officer in the Mexican War, and in the Civil War he repeatedly slipped behind enemy lines to gather intelligence and aid Union prisoners of war. His post at the prison made him an object of Southern wrath.''The Confederates were determined to capture and hang him,'' said a lengthy obituary published on March 21, 1903, in The Washington Star. ''Dozens, perhaps scores, of times he escaped from apparently inextricable dangers by his extraordinary nerve, adroitness and audacity, coupled with prodigious physical strength and activity.''Mr. Wood parted with the government somewhat unhappily in 1869; he sought the $20,000 reward offered for cracking the Brockaway case but received only $5,000. His obituary said thousands of dollars of claims from that case and others were before Congress at his death in the local soldiers home. He was buried in the cemetery in Southeast Washington, among other notable people of the period.His legacy to the service continues in the general orders he issued to his first operatives, who were paid $3 a day.He wrote, ''Each man must recognize his service belongs to the government through 24 hours of each day'' and ''continuing employment in the service will depend upon demonstrated fitness, ability as investigators and honesty and fidelity in all transactions.''Mr. Stafford, the current director, said: ''Those things are all still here with us. He laid such a strong foundation.'' Continue reading the main story
