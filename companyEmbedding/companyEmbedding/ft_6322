Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...





Home Values & Sold Home Prices

Ever wonder, "how much is my house worth?" Search by state, city, zip code, or address to find homes recently sold in your neighborhood. Home values are calculated from sold prices, public records of assessed value, and area real estate information. While these estimates can help planning a real estate purchase or sale, you should always consult with a real estate agent or house appraisal specialist. Need more help? We can also assist when searching for homes for sale, homes for rent, or with finding the best mortgage rates.

40 Watt 4 Pin 2G11 CFL Compact Fluorescents

To illuminate a space more fully, try a 40-watt, 4-pin, plug-in CFL 2G11 bulb in your office, restaurant, retail display or warehouse. These twin-tube lamps are up to 75 percent more efficient that an incandescent lighting fixture and can produce anywhere from 2,600 to 4,100 lumens. With four pins placed in a straight line across the base, these bulbs operate at 40 watts and have color temperatures ranging from 3,000K through 6,500K. Additionally, 40-watt 4-pin plug-in CFL bulbs have lifespans up to 20,000 hours. For help choosing the lighting fixture that's right for your application, ask the experts and discover the largest selection of bulbs and light fixtures at 1000Bulbs, where you'll find deals you won't see anywhere else.

                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas

expensive but last a long time
These light bulbs are expensive but they last a very long time. I leave them on all the time and some have been on for over 7 years.

Shines a light on your darker areas
When this lightbulb was installed, it really lit up the room. The room was dark before, now it is bright. Don't worry about the room being bright all the time. This light bulb is so versatile it allows you to turn it off as long as you have access the the light switch. On or Off it looks like a finely hand blow glass tube. I would highly recommend this light bulb for any and all of your lighting needs.
