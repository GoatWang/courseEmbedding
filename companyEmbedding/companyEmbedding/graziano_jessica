Jessica A Graziano's Experience
Title: Fifth Grade Special Education Teacher
               Company: New York City Department of Education
Job Details
               The New York City Department of Education provides challenging standards-based instructional practices and highly engaging learning opportunities to children with exceptional capacity or creative talent. Gifted and talented programs are district-based and begin in either kindergarten or first grade, depending on the district or borough. Generally, district gifted and talented programs in Manhattan and Brooklyn begin in kindergarten and programs in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island begin in the first grade. There are also three citywide gifted and talented schools, which accept students from all five boroughs. Gifted and talented students are identified after a rigorous testing process and are placed in gifted and talented programs located in various schools throughout New York City. The DOE offers the self-contained classroom model in which gifted students receive appropriate instruction as a group for the entire day. These students receive a variety of enrichment and acceleration experiences that meet their advanced learning needs. The regular curriculum is modified or changed to meet students' needs.  While gifted and talented programs in elementary schools offer academic advancement, programs for middle school students can also offer services to students with artistic talent (visual arts, dance, music, etc.). For a complete list of elementary and middle school programs, see Programs/Services.  The DOE's comprehensive, Citywide approach to gifted and talented education includes expanding access and opportunity for all students. To meet eligible students' needs, the DOE creates new programs, often in traditionally underserved communities, and maintains and supports existing programs.  The DOE also supports enrichment programs. A large number of schools offer enrichment programs to their students based on student interest, talent and ability. Enrichment programs differ in each school as they are developed to meet the needs of the school community. Schools can have enrichment programs in math, science, arts and any other content area. The Department of Gifted/Talented & Enrichment is responsible for developing policy and program recommendations to meet the educational needs of gifted students while ensuring equity of access to gifted and talented programs for all students in New York City public schools.
