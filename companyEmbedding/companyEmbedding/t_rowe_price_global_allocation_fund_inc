The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are

*Ratings displayed with hollow stars represent Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings.  Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual fund share class that don't have a 1, 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history.  These hypothetical Morningstar Ratings are based on the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted for fees and expenses.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







*The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

Note: Analysis represents the equity-only performance of the portfolio as calculated by the Wilshire Atlas attribution model, and is exclusive of cash, trusts, mutual funds, de-listed securities and other non-equity holdings. Returns will not match official TRP performance because Wilshire uses different pricing and exchange rate sources and does not capture intra-day trading or fair-value pricing. Performance for each security is obtained in the local currency and, if necessary, is converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate determined by an independent third party.

Note: Analysis represents the equity-only performance of the portfolio as calculated by the Wilshire Atlas attribution model, and is exclusive of cash, trusts, mutual funds, de-listed securities and other non-equity holdings. Returns will not match official TRP performance because Wilshire uses different pricing and exchange rate sources and does not capture intra-day trading or fair-value pricing. Performance for each security is obtained in the local currency and, if necessary, is converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate determined by an independent third party.

The T. Rowe Price Funds - I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 



All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Please visit a fund’s profile page for additional information on its investment objective, strategies, and risks. 



The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown next to the gross and net expense ratio values above. Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 



Closed to new investors except for a direct rollover from a retirement plan into a T. Rowe Price IRA invested in this fund.



Certain limited exceptions may apply to these scenarios. The funds reserve the right, when in the judgment of T. Rowe Price, it is not adverse to a fund's interest, to permit certain types of investors to open new accounts in a fund, to impose further restrictions, or to close a fund to any additional investments, all without notice.

Investor Class
RPGAX

The fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad. To the extent the fund has investments in emerging market countries; it will be subject to abrupt and severe price declines.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
In a single offering, the fund offers, global diversification across asset classes and regions of the world, tactical views expressed through portfolio reallocations, and bottom up security selection to create an actively managed global portfolio.The fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates, political or economic uncertainty abroad, or abrupt and severe price declines.  These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets. The portfolio’s investments in alternative investments and hedge funds are difficult to value and monitor when compared with more traditional investments, and may increase the fund’s liquidity risks. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Derivatives are used in the fund for selective market exposures.



Investor Profile
The fund could be an appropriate part of your overall investment strategy if you want to diversify your portfolio by adding a fund with investments in both international and domestic stocks and bonds and you are comfortable with the risks that accompany international investments (including the special risks associated with investing in emerging markets). The fund can be used in both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is 
      available upon request.

Net of fees performance reflects the deduction of the highest applicable management fee ("Model Net Fee") that would be charged based on the fee schedule appropriate to you for this mandate, without the benefit of breakpoints. Please be advised that the composite may include other investment products that are subject to management fees that are inapplicable to you but are in excess of the Model Net Fee. Therefore, the actual performance of all the portfolios in the composite on a net fee basis will be different, and may be lower, than the Model Net Fee performance. However, such Model Net Fee performance is intended to provide the most appropriate example of the impact management fees would have by applying management fees relevant to you to the gross performance of the composite. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 



Returns for time periods greater than one year are annualized.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is 
      available upon request.

				Global Allocation Fund - I Class

I Class
TGAFX

Invests in a broadly diversified global portfolio of investments including developed and emerging market equities, a wide range of global developed and emerging market fixed income strategies, plus various diversifying strategies providing exposure to hedge funds, currency hedging, and equity index call writing.
The fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad. To the extent the fund has investments in emerging market countries; it will be subject to abrupt and severe price declines. The portfolio’s investments in alternative investments and hedge funds are difficult to value and monitor when compared with more traditional investments, and may increase the fund’s liquidity risks. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Derivatives are used in the fund for selective market exposures.

*Ratings displayed with hollow stars represent Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings.  Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual fund share class that don't have a 1, 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history.  These hypothetical Morningstar Ratings are based on the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted for fees and expenses.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







*The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 







T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is required to permanently waive a portion of its management fee charged to the fund in an amount sufficient to fully offset any acquired fund fees and expenses related to investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds. The amount of the waiver will vary each fiscal year in proportion to the amount invested in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Benefits & Risks
In a single offering, the fund offers, global diversification across asset classes and regions of the world, tactical views expressed through portfolio reallocations, and bottom up security selection to create an actively managed global portfolio.The fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates, political or economic uncertainty abroad, or abrupt and severe price declines.  These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets. The portfolio’s investments in alternative investments and hedge funds are difficult to value and monitor when compared with more traditional investments, and may increase the fund’s liquidity risks. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Derivatives are used in the fund for selective market exposures.



Investor Profile
The fund could be an appropriate part of your overall investment strategy if you want to diversify your portfolio by adding a fund with investments in both international and domestic stocks and bonds and you are comfortable with the risks that accompany international investments (including the special risks associated with investing in emerging markets). The fund can be used in both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.



Risk/Return Characteristics
No data available. The fund inception is less than 3 years.

Asia Opportunities Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in stocks issued by companies that are located in, or that have economic ties to, Asia (excluding Japan). May purchase stocks issued by companies of any size, but typically focuses on large-and mid-cap stocks. The fund is "nondiversified", meaning it may invest a greater portion of assets in a single company and own more of the company's voting securities than is permissible for a "diversified" fund. Further, the fund’s relatively limited geographic orientation and exposure to emerging markets increase its risk level. The fund price is subject to market risk in addition to risks associated with unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad.

Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% of its net assets (including any borrowings for investment purposes) in stocks issued by companies in emerging markets. The fund invests in companies of any size, but generally seeks stocks of larger companies that are undervalued. Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. In addition, international investments are subject to settlement practices and regulatory and financial reporting standards that differ from those of the U.S.

Financial Services Fund

Invests at least 80% in the common stocks of financial services companies. The fund may also invest in companies deriving substantial revenues from conducting business with the industry. The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries, so it could experience significant volatility. However, dividends paid by financial services firms may moderate this risk. Financial services companies may be hurt when interest rates rise sharply and may be vulnerable to rapidly rising inflation.

Global Consumer Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in securities issued by companies in the consumer sector. The adviser has flexibility in allocating investments between the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors and seeks to identify the best risk adjusted opportunities for the fund based on market conditions and consumer sentiment.Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse local, political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A fund that focuses its investments in specific industries or sectors is more susceptible to developments affecting those industries and sectors than a more broadly diversified fund. Because the fund invests significantly in companies connected to the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors, the fund may perform poorly during a downturn in one or more consumer-related industries and is more exposed to the economic, business or other developments that could adversely impact those industries.

Global Growth Stock Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in target blue chip companies in at least five different countries, including the U.S. It takes a growth approach to investing, seeking opportunities that have potential for above-average earnings. Since the fund invests overseas, its foreign holdings could be affected by declining foreign currencies or adverse political or economic events. The fund’s growth approach carries risk: Because growth funds have higher valuations and lower dividend yields than slower-growth or cyclical companies, the share price volatility may be higher. As such, fund prices could decline further in market downturns than those of non growth-oriented funds.

Global Real Estate Fund


      Subscribe





Invests primarily in stocks of real estate companies throughout the world, providing exposure in at least five different countries, including the United States. Changes in tax or zoning laws, overbuilding, environmental issues, changes in interest rates, the quality of property management (REITs), and other factors could hurt the fund. Real estate is affected by general economic conditions. When growth is slowing, demand for property decreases and prices may decline. Rising interest rates, which drive up mortgage and financing costs, can restrain construction and buying and selling activity and may reduce the appeal of real estate investments. Since the fund can invest substantially in foreign securities, it will also be subject to the risks inherent in non-U.S. issues.

      Subscribe





Individuals seeking long-term growth of capital who can accept the possibility of more share price volatility than is associated with larger companies or the broad market averages. Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by small-and mid-cap companies, it is likely to be more volatile than a fund that focuses on securities issued by larger companies. Small- and medium-sized companies often have less experienced management, narrower product lines, more limited financial resources, and less publicly available information than larger companies. In addition, smaller companies are typically more sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions and their securities may be difficult to trade. The fund's strategy relies heavily on quantitative models to analyze data and construct investment portfolios. Relying on quantitative models entails the risk that the models themselves may be limited or incorrect, that the data that the models rely on may be incorrect or incomplete, and that the adviser may not be successful in selecting companies for investment or determining the weighting of particular stocks.

Real Assets Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in "real assets" and securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to, or have substantial ownership of, real assets. Real assets include any assets that have physical properties, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

Invests in both growth and value stocks. Stocks will be selected that have the most favorable combination of company fundamentals, earnings potential and valuation. Stocks with growth characteristics can have sharp price declines as a result of earnings disappointments. Stocks with value characteristics carry the risk that the market will not recognize their intrinsic value for a long time or that they are actually appropriately priced at a low level. The fund’s fairly concentrated portfolio means poor performance by several fund holdings could affect the fund more than a fund holding a larger number of companies.

Invests at least 80% in bonds, and seeks to offer some protection against rising interest rates and a low correlation with the equity markets. May invest in a variety of debt securities, obligations issued by U.S. and foreign corporations, as well as bank loans.The Fund is subject to the risk that rising interest rates will cause bond prices to fall. The fund is “nondiversified” so its share price can be expected to fluctuate more than that of a “diversified” fund. Investments in foreign bonds are subject to special risks, including potentially adverse overseas political and economic developments, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. The fund’s use of derivatives may expose it to additional volatility in comparison to investing directly in bonds and other debt securities.

Invests in domestic and foreign debt instruments, including government and corporate bonds; mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities; and preferred stocks.If interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond fund total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. High-yield bonds carry greater default risk than higher-rated bonds along with greater liquidity risk. To the extent the fund holds foreign bonds, it will be subject to special risks, including potentially adverse political and economic developments overseas, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. Investments in emerging markets are subject to the risk of abrupt and severe price declines.

Past performance cannot guarantee future results.
This fund is subject to general stock and bond market risks. The fund's share price can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings. Investments overseas generally carry more risk than investments in U.S. assets, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad. To the extent the fund has investments in emerging market countries, it will be more subject to abrupt and severe price declines. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in down markets.
*Morningstar rated the Global Allocation Fund 5-, 5-stars, N/A, and N/A among 395, 395, N/A and N/A World Allocation funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) ending 6/30/17, respectively.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

				Morningstar rated the Global Allocation Fund among

N/A

N/A
World Allocation
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
	

^ The fund's net expense ratio excludes expenses permanently waived as a result 
of investments in other T. Rowe Price mutual funds and expenses that were waived 
or borne by T. Rowe Price pursuant to the fund's expense limitation, but includes 
expenses associated with investments in non-T. Rowe Price investment companies.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Strategy






Investment Objective
The fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and income.




Investment Approach

The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and income. The Fund blends active security selection and asset allocation positioning in a broadly diversified global portfolio of stocks, bonds, cash, and alternatives across sectors, regions, and market capitalizations.
The Fund’s broad opportunity set includes developed and emerging market equities, a wide range of global developed and emerging market fixed income strategies across sectors and credit quality, plus various diversifying strategies providing exposure to hedge funds, currency hedging, real asset equities, and an equity index-option strategy.
The Fund has the ability to utilize tactical asset allocation within defined ranges for each asset class or sector to potentially capitalize on a variety of global market environments.
Sources of value added:
Portfolio Design: Strategic allocation that is diversified across asset classes and sectors with low correlations to dampen volatility and includes investments that have the potential to enhance long-term returns.
Tactical Asset Allocation: The Asset Allocation Committee makes tactical decisions to overweight or underweight asset classes and sectors based on a 6-18 month investment horizon.
Fundamentally-Driven Security Selection: Underlying portfolio managers select individual securities leveraging the T. Rowe Price global research platform of approximately 200 fundamental equity and credit analysts.


The Fund is subject to the unique risks of international investing, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad. To the extent the fund has investments in emerging market countries; it will be subject to abrupt and severe price declines. The portfolio’s investments in alternative investments and hedge funds are difficult to value and monitor when compared with more traditional investments, and may increase the fund’s liquidity risks. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Derivatives are used in the fund for selective market exposures.





Portfolio Construction

The Fund’s long-term strategic neutral asset allocation is 60% stocks, 30% bonds and cash, and 10% alternative investments and has an allocation to diversifying strategies seeking to enhance the risk and return profile of the portfolio through sources of less correlated returns and diversified sources of income.
Approximately 40% of the Fund’s investments are in international stocks and bonds, representing both developed and emerging markets.
An allocation to global equities is designed to capture the breadth of global investing opportunities with approximately 50% of the equity allocation in international equities.
An allocation to global fixed income markets, with one-third in international bonds, designed to emphasize specific attributes that contribute to the overall portfolio across a range of economic environments.

   Source   for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the   official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment   and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less   than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate   between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if   different. Sales charges (up to a maximum of 5% for the A Class), taxes and   other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they   will reduce the performance figures. Past   performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.




The indicative benchmark is 60% MSCI AC World Index (Developed Markets only hedged to USD), 28% Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index (hedged to USD) and 12% USD LIBOR.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.






   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.
