                            John Eckhardt





Prophet Arise - Your Call To Boldly Speak The Word Of The Lord

Something is stirring inside of you, but it has been silenced, gravely undermined, and misunderstood. You must believe that God has not forgotten you. He has not sidelined you. You are not crazy. Prophet, arise! Come out of your cave and be encouraged to speak forth the word of the Lord. God is calling you to be His Trumpet and to sound the alarm.

The body of Christ desperately needs prophets to awaken and go forth. Whether you have never spoken a prophetic word or you actively engage your gift, best-selling author John Eckhardt provides an unparalleled, inspiring teaching for you. He boldly reveals the characteristics of a prophet that may lie dormant in your life so God can launch you into your calling. You will learn:

• Unique characteristics of a prophet
• The details of a prophet’s call
• What moves a prophet’s heart and stirs the anointing
• The rewards a prophet brings to those who receive them
• How to find healing and deliverance for the prophet who has been hurt

And much more!

"Unshakeable"
                        

                            John Eckhardt





Unshakeable
Dismantling Satan's Plan To Destroy Your Foundation

We all know people who sometimes act in polar opposites: the minister who is godly,
prayerful, and holy at times, yet has periods of sin and perversion; the person who is
outgoing and cheerful, yet falls into bouts of withdrawal and depression; or the person
who is gentle and kind, yet has periods of outburst and rage.

Unshakeable is a teaching unlike any other from best-selling author John Eckhardt on
breaking the most binding, demonic force: double-mindedness. Through this powerful
book you will develop a firm, Christlike identity that will not be easily shaken by this world.
You will learn how to overcome the manifestations of double-mindedness that result in:

• Broken marriages and divorce
• Indecision and passivity
• Bitterness and anger
• Hurt and offense
• Fear and rejection
• Spiritually rooted sickness and disease
And much more!

"Fasting For Breakthrough And Deliverance"
                        

                            John Eckhardt





Fasting For Breakthrough And Deliverance
Pray. Believe. Receive.

Matthew 17:21 tells us that there are some spirits in a person, region, or nation that cannot be overcome without fasting. Many believers struggle with certain limitations that they cannot seem to break through. A revelation of the power of fasting will result in victories that would not be ordinarily obtained. A life of consistent fasting will cause many victories to manifest. God’s will is for every believer to live a life of victory with nothing being impossible.

There is freedom from the torment of the enemy!
Best-selling author and trusted teacher on deliverance, John Eckhardt reveals strongholds that can be broken including poverty, sickness, witchcraft, sexual impurity, pride, fear, confusion, and marital problems. Fasting will help readers to overcome these manifestations of oppression and break free from their limitations.

Invisible King And His Kingdom
How To Understand Operate In & Advance Gods Will for Healing, Deliverance and Miracles!

The Kingdom of God Is Near...During His ministry on earth, Jesus repeatedly talked about, explained, and defined the kingdom of God. When He announced that the kingdom was at hand, it was the turning point in human history. But what did He mean? And how does it apply to our families and our communities today?

In The Invisible King and His Kingdom, John Eckhardt presents the good news about God’s promises for our world and how to obtain them. Challenging the negative worldview of many Christians, he explains the realities of the kingdom of God that is here now and gives answers to important questions such as…

 • What are the signs of the kingdom of God?
 • How do we walk in and access this kingdom?
 • How do we live in this kingdom?
 • How do we operate in the power and the authority of this kingdom?

The kingdom of God has been forcefully advancing since the days of John the Baptist, and it is still advancing today! Discover how to seize the kingdom for healing, deliverance, and faith and how to demonstrate authority over the powers of darkness.

"50 Truths Concerning The Apostolic Ministry"
                        

                            John Eckhardt





Setting the Record Straight on Apostolic Ministry

How can you tell the true from the false?

How can you tell if a particular ministry is from God or not?

The term apostle is one which has been a part of the New Testament Church from its inception. It is also an office that has been denied, abused, overstated, and understated by those who are biblically uninformed in today's Church.

In this informative book, John Eckhardt, provides 50 clear distinctions of apostolic ministry as revealed in Gods word. These characteristics will equip you to understand this significant ground-breaking ministry. Not only will you learn how to detect the true from the false, but you will receive the spiritual liberty to fully honor and appreciate this vital gift that God has set in His Church.

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
