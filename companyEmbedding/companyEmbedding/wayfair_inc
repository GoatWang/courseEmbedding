            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Comforter Sets



Make your bed even more comfortable with a luxurious new comforter from Wayfair. We spend a lot of time sleeping, so it's important to invest in a comforter set that you like and that is appropriate for different temperatures throughout the seasons. Besides considerations like thread count and fill loft, make sure you think about the fun stuff like colors and patterns. From the classic white comforter to exciting geometric or floral designs, we can help your bedroom pop with our comforter set selection.   



Here are some considerations to make when buying a comforter:  

 Fill When shopping for a comforter online that is going to be great at keeping you warm and is also soft, down comforters are a popular go-to choice. Down is an incredible insulator that comes from a variety of birds, so it can trigger existing allergies. Therefore, a majority of our products on the page are polyfill or polyester comforters which are alternative choices for those with down sensitivities. Polyfill or polyester comforter sets provide a similar level of insulation and comfort and are often lower in price. When considering the fill power of your blanket, higher fill power (sometimes called fill loft) means that the comforter is using better quality, larger down clusters. For those looking for a luxury down comforter, look for fill loft over 700. Mid-grade fill power is generally between 500 - 700, and low grade is in the 400 and below range. We also carry cotton filled comforters if that is your preference. With so many options, it's easy to buy a comforter on Wayfair.    

 Comforter Material Our polyester comforter sets offer a wide variety of beautiful comforter designs. Polyester is a great material for a comforter if you're looking for a pop of color in your guest bedroom or master bedroom. Be sure to use the pattern filters in the left-hand side of the page to filter to designs like nautical, floral, or sports to find the perfect look for your room or family member. Cotton comforters are also a great choice. Look for a thread count in the 400 - 600 range for the most luxurious material weave. A thread count of 250 and up classifies the cotton as high quality, while a count between 100 and 250 is still very comfortable, but on the lower end of the thread count spectrum.    
We hope this guide has given you some useful information to reference while shopping for your bedding comforter set online. Feel free to reach out to our Customer Service representatives if you have further questions via email or phone!  
Found a comforter set for your bed? Great! Now don't forget to take a look at our selection of mattress covers to ensure that you have the complete set of bed and mattress accessories!

Furniture



When it comes to furnishing your home finding the perfect furniture that is both stylish and functional is one of the best parts about owning a home. You can let your inner interior designer flourish sorting through all the decoration options, deciding on how to blend colors, patterns, and materials. With such variety in home furniture, it's important to know the differences between these styles and materials so you can find what works best for you. For instance, will Victorian furniture fit in with your design if you want to create a vibrant room with bright colors and contrasting highlights? Or does it make more sense to use a brighter theme and utilize coastal furniture to accomplish your goals? We'll try to go over all these details here so you can get on your way to finding the best home furniture for you.






Furniture Styles
There are many styles that you can use and combine to create the aesthetic look that you want. From coastal to modern to Victorian home furniture styles can literally come in any shape or color. So how do you decide what style works best for you? It comes down to how you want to present your home. If you live near a beach and want to have a coastal style you can blend your coastal furniture, which are generally wickers and bright colored couches with light blue walls and yellow highlights. 
Or if you want a more traditional look, Victorian furniture might fit your style more effectively. This furniture type is usually made from dark, solid wood and come with classic designs. And you can blend Victorian furniture with darker walls and different colored finishes of wood to have a complete home design. Finally, modern furniture is the most recent type of style. Modern furniture is simple and is most commonly finished in black or white to create a minimalist look to the home.
Furniture Materials
Lastly you need to decide what material you prefer the most for your furniture. Each material has its own benefits ranging from durability to aesthetic design to portability. For example, if you want a coffee table that is both light and easy to move, acrylic furniture is a fantastic option because it has both of those qualities. Metal is another fantastic material because it will last a long time and there are plenty of design options to choose from because of this materials popularity. With the combination of its sheen and the versatility with which it can be shaped, metal is a great option to look into as well. Your material selection isn't limited to only acrylic furniture and metal, you can find glass, marble, or wood in abundance here at Wayfair. So feel free to mix and match as you wish in order to design your room the way you want.

Wayfair, Inc. is an American e-commerce company that sells home goods. Formerly known as CSN Stores, the company was founded in 2002 and now sells many home furnishings and décor items.[1] Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts,[2] Wayfair has offices and warehouses throughout the United States as well as in Canada, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.[3]

History[edit]
2002 to 2006[edit]
Entrepreneurs Niraj Shah and Steve Conine founded Wayfair in August 2002, as a two-person company with a makeshift headquarters in Conine’s nursery, in Boston, Massachusetts.[4] Both Shah and Conine hold Bachelor of Science degrees from Cornell University. The pair had run two previous companies—Simplify Mobile and iXL, a global consulting firm—before starting Wayfair.[5]
As of February 2013, Shah is the Chief Executive Officer of the company, and Conine is the Chairman and Chief Technology Officer.
Originally known as CSN Stores (the name is derived from a mix of Shah and Conine’s initials), the company began with the website racksandstands.com, selling media stands and storage furniture.
In 2003, the company added patio and garden goods suppliers, three online stores, and more than a dozen employees, and relocated the headquarters into an office on Newbury Street, in Boston.
Over the next two years, the company expanded its catalogue to include home décor; office, institutional, and kitchen and dining furniture and materials; home improvement goods; bed and bath materials; luggage; and lighting. In 2006, the company earned $100 million in sales.[6]
2007 to 2010[edit]
For the next four years, the company expanded in the United States and in international markets.
In 2008, CSN Stores began shipping to Canada and selling in the United Kingdom, and opened an office in London. In the same year, the Boston Business Journal ranked the company the #1 fastest growing private e-commerce company in Massachusetts, and the #4 fastest growing private company overall.[citation needed] In 2009, the company expanded to Germany. In 2010, the company relocated its headquarters to 177 Huntington Avenue, where they occupied 10 floors. At the end of that year, the company launched Joss & Main, a members-only private sales online store.
2011 to present[edit]
By 2011, CSN Stores owned over 200 online shops, largely niche shops for specific products, like cookware.com, everyatomicclock.com, and strollers.com. In an effort to scale, to direct traffic to a single site, and to unify the aesthetic of the company, Shah and Conine rebranded CSN Stores as Wayfair.
To market the new brand and to increase its expansion, in June 2011 the company raised $165 million in funding from four investment firms: Battery Ventures, Great Hill Partners, HarbourVest Partners, and Spark Capital.[7]
Wayfair.com launched on September 1, 2011.[8] As of July 2012, Wayfair had consolidated all of its niche websites, with the exception of Joss & Main and AllModern, into Wayfair.com. In August 2012, Wayfair launched Wayfair Supply, a single destination for Wayfair's business, government, and institutional customers. In August 2013, Wayfair acquired DwellStudio, a New York City-based design house and retailer focused on modern home and family furnishings.[9]
In March 2014, T. Rowe Price led a $157 million pre-IPO financing, valuing the company at more than $2 billion.[10]
In late June 2014, the company again relocated its headquarters, this time to 4 Copley Place, about a block away from its previous headquarters at 177 Huntington Avenue. Along with 4 Copley Place, the company has two satellite offices in the surrounding area.[11]
In October 2014, Wayfair raised over $300 million through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.[12] In July 2015, Wayfair sold its Australian business to local online retailer, Temple & Webster, for an undisclosed amount.[13] The brand was renamed to Zizo and later absorbed into the Temple & Webster business.
As of January 2014, Wayfair was the largest online-only retailer for home furniture in the United States,[14] and the 33rd largest online retailer in the United States.[15] The company generated $380 million in revenue in 2010, over $500 million in 2011, over $600 million in 2012, over $900 million in 2013, and over $1.3 billion in 2014.[16] In 2015, the net revenue of Wayfair increased to $2.25 billion,[17] and to $3.4 billion in 2016.[18]

History[edit]
2002 to 2006[edit]
Entrepreneurs Niraj Shah and Steve Conine founded Wayfair in August 2002, as a two-person company with a makeshift headquarters in Conine’s nursery, in Boston, Massachusetts.[4] Both Shah and Conine hold Bachelor of Science degrees from Cornell University. The pair had run two previous companies—Simplify Mobile and iXL, a global consulting firm—before starting Wayfair.[5]
As of February 2013, Shah is the Chief Executive Officer of the company, and Conine is the Chairman and Chief Technology Officer.
Originally known as CSN Stores (the name is derived from a mix of Shah and Conine’s initials), the company began with the website racksandstands.com, selling media stands and storage furniture.
In 2003, the company added patio and garden goods suppliers, three online stores, and more than a dozen employees, and relocated the headquarters into an office on Newbury Street, in Boston.
Over the next two years, the company expanded its catalogue to include home décor; office, institutional, and kitchen and dining furniture and materials; home improvement goods; bed and bath materials; luggage; and lighting. In 2006, the company earned $100 million in sales.[6]
2007 to 2010[edit]
For the next four years, the company expanded in the United States and in international markets.
In 2008, CSN Stores began shipping to Canada and selling in the United Kingdom, and opened an office in London. In the same year, the Boston Business Journal ranked the company the #1 fastest growing private e-commerce company in Massachusetts, and the #4 fastest growing private company overall.[citation needed] In 2009, the company expanded to Germany. In 2010, the company relocated its headquarters to 177 Huntington Avenue, where they occupied 10 floors. At the end of that year, the company launched Joss & Main, a members-only private sales online store.
2011 to present[edit]
By 2011, CSN Stores owned over 200 online shops, largely niche shops for specific products, like cookware.com, everyatomicclock.com, and strollers.com. In an effort to scale, to direct traffic to a single site, and to unify the aesthetic of the company, Shah and Conine rebranded CSN Stores as Wayfair.
To market the new brand and to increase its expansion, in June 2011 the company raised $165 million in funding from four investment firms: Battery Ventures, Great Hill Partners, HarbourVest Partners, and Spark Capital.[7]
Wayfair.com launched on September 1, 2011.[8] As of July 2012, Wayfair had consolidated all of its niche websites, with the exception of Joss & Main and AllModern, into Wayfair.com. In August 2012, Wayfair launched Wayfair Supply, a single destination for Wayfair's business, government, and institutional customers. In August 2013, Wayfair acquired DwellStudio, a New York City-based design house and retailer focused on modern home and family furnishings.[9]
In March 2014, T. Rowe Price led a $157 million pre-IPO financing, valuing the company at more than $2 billion.[10]
In late June 2014, the company again relocated its headquarters, this time to 4 Copley Place, about a block away from its previous headquarters at 177 Huntington Avenue. Along with 4 Copley Place, the company has two satellite offices in the surrounding area.[11]
In October 2014, Wayfair raised over $300 million through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.[12] In July 2015, Wayfair sold its Australian business to local online retailer, Temple & Webster, for an undisclosed amount.[13] The brand was renamed to Zizo and later absorbed into the Temple & Webster business.
As of January 2014, Wayfair was the largest online-only retailer for home furniture in the United States,[14] and the 33rd largest online retailer in the United States.[15] The company generated $380 million in revenue in 2010, over $500 million in 2011, over $600 million in 2012, over $900 million in 2013, and over $1.3 billion in 2014.[16] In 2015, the net revenue of Wayfair increased to $2.25 billion,[17] and to $3.4 billion in 2016.[18]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Décor & Pillows



Looking for home décor or design ideas? Then you've come to the right place! There's never been a better time to Wayfair your home with colorful and creative home decorations. Adding decor pieces to your home is an opportunity to turn a blank slate room into a vibrant living space that reflects your personality!

Shop our selection of decorative accents, rugs, wall art, window treatments and more! Shop by room or browse by brand, whether you're looking to decorate an apartment or your new home. With the latest trends in home decor and interior design at affordable prices, we're sure to have everything for your decorating needs. Shop online on our website to find the stylish decorations you’ve been looking for, and be sure to take advantage of free shipping on orders over $49!




Discover Your Style


Adding decor to your home is a great way to show off your visual style. We have popular styles including contemporary, modern, traditional and rustic options to fit in your home. We also have more niche styles like coastal, cabin, mid-century, cottage/country, industrial and much more. Not only do we have a vast selection of different styles to choose from, we also have great themes. Shopping by theme is a great way to find those decor pieces. Whether you are obsessed with the beach, a certain animal, we have decorative accents and wall decor that you can sort in order to find the theme you are looking for.



Choose a Room to Decorate


Think about the different parts of your home to decorate! For your floors, be sure to look at rugs. Walls looking a little bare? Shop for some wall decor. We have plenty of wall art, tapestries, wall clocks, and other accent pieces to cover those blank walls. If you are looking to spice up the appearance of a table, start by identifying which table you’d like to decorate. For an entryway table, you may want to look at picture frames to display family pictures or maybe a small vase to hold flowers for a nice welcoming touch. An entryway or foyer may be a good opportunity to add a decorative wall mirror. For kitchen tables, we have great tabletop centerpieces to really bring the table together. Don’t forget your windows! We have window treatments to cover windows and glass doors of all sizes. Shop eye-catching blinds, shades, curtains and drapes. We have tons of window treatment options available.
