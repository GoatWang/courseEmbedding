Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive. Between 2014-2018, the top of the line Maserati Quattroporte GTS will be receiving a 560-horsepower V8 with all-wheel drive to replace the current 523 horsepower V8 with rear wheel drive in the GTS model. The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]
Jeep[edit]
In 2014, the new Jeep Renegade launches. After a long absence in the Malaysian market, Jeep has once again landed in Malaysia. DRB-Hicom is exclusively appointed by Fiat Chrysler to distribute the brand’s cars in Malaysia.[33] In 2015, the Jeep Grand Cherokee will be refreshed, and Fan Bingbing, Tina Fey, Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett will promote as the brand ambassadors. 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Jeep, and the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot will see their last model year, and a new SUV will be launched, along with a refreshed Jeep Cherokee. In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]
Ram[edit]
In 2014, a ProMaster van was launched, along with the smaller ProMaster City, derived from Fiat Ducato and Fiat Doblò respectively.[27] In 2017, a new Ram 1500 will be launched, and a commercial light-duty truck will be refreshed. In 2018, a new Ram HD will be launched, along with a commercial heavy-duty truck, and Ram chassis cab will receive a major update.[27]

Logo[edit]
The new FCA logo was created by the Italian branding company Robilant Associati,[35][36] ending the use of the Fiat S.p.A. logo and Chrysler Pentastar logo for group branding.[37]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]

Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive. Between 2014-2018, the top of the line Maserati Quattroporte GTS will be receiving a 560-horsepower V8 with all-wheel drive to replace the current 523 horsepower V8 with rear wheel drive in the GTS model. The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]
Jeep[edit]
In 2014, the new Jeep Renegade launches. After a long absence in the Malaysian market, Jeep has once again landed in Malaysia. DRB-Hicom is exclusively appointed by Fiat Chrysler to distribute the brand’s cars in Malaysia.[33] In 2015, the Jeep Grand Cherokee will be refreshed, and Fan Bingbing, Tina Fey, Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett will promote as the brand ambassadors. 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Jeep, and the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot will see their last model year, and a new SUV will be launched, along with a refreshed Jeep Cherokee. In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]
Ram[edit]
In 2014, a ProMaster van was launched, along with the smaller ProMaster City, derived from Fiat Ducato and Fiat Doblò respectively.[27] In 2017, a new Ram 1500 will be launched, and a commercial light-duty truck will be refreshed. In 2018, a new Ram HD will be launched, along with a commercial heavy-duty truck, and Ram chassis cab will receive a major update.[27]

Logo[edit]
The new FCA logo was created by the Italian branding company Robilant Associati,[35][36] ending the use of the Fiat S.p.A. logo and Chrysler Pentastar logo for group branding.[37]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive. Between 2014-2018, the top of the line Maserati Quattroporte GTS will be receiving a 560-horsepower V8 with all-wheel drive to replace the current 523 horsepower V8 with rear wheel drive in the GTS model. The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]
Jeep[edit]
In 2014, the new Jeep Renegade launches. After a long absence in the Malaysian market, Jeep has once again landed in Malaysia. DRB-Hicom is exclusively appointed by Fiat Chrysler to distribute the brand’s cars in Malaysia.[33] In 2015, the Jeep Grand Cherokee will be refreshed, and Fan Bingbing, Tina Fey, Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett will promote as the brand ambassadors. 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Jeep, and the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot will see their last model year, and a new SUV will be launched, along with a refreshed Jeep Cherokee. In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]
Ram[edit]
In 2014, a ProMaster van was launched, along with the smaller ProMaster City, derived from Fiat Ducato and Fiat Doblò respectively.[27] In 2017, a new Ram 1500 will be launched, and a commercial light-duty truck will be refreshed. In 2018, a new Ram HD will be launched, along with a commercial heavy-duty truck, and Ram chassis cab will receive a major update.[27]

In 2015 worldwide shipments were 4.6 million units, revenues totaled €113.2 billion, up 18% (+6% at constant exchange rates, or CER), adjusted EBIT was €5.3 billion, up 40% and Adjusted net profit was €2.0 billion, up 91%.[34]
Logo[edit]
The new FCA logo was created by the Italian branding company Robilant Associati,[35][36] ending the use of the Fiat S.p.A. logo and Chrysler Pentastar logo for group branding.[37]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive. Between 2014-2018, the top of the line Maserati Quattroporte GTS will be receiving a 560-horsepower V8 with all-wheel drive to replace the current 523 horsepower V8 with rear wheel drive in the GTS model. The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]
Jeep[edit]
In 2014, the new Jeep Renegade launches. After a long absence in the Malaysian market, Jeep has once again landed in Malaysia. DRB-Hicom is exclusively appointed by Fiat Chrysler to distribute the brand’s cars in Malaysia.[33] In 2015, the Jeep Grand Cherokee will be refreshed, and Fan Bingbing, Tina Fey, Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett will promote as the brand ambassadors. 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Jeep, and the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot will see their last model year, and a new SUV will be launched, along with a refreshed Jeep Cherokee. In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]
Ram[edit]
In 2014, a ProMaster van was launched, along with the smaller ProMaster City, derived from Fiat Ducato and Fiat Doblò respectively.[27] In 2017, a new Ram 1500 will be launched, and a commercial light-duty truck will be refreshed. In 2018, a new Ram HD will be launched, along with a commercial heavy-duty truck, and Ram chassis cab will receive a major update.[27]

In 2015 worldwide shipments were 4.6 million units, revenues totaled €113.2 billion, up 18% (+6% at constant exchange rates, or CER), adjusted EBIT was €5.3 billion, up 40% and Adjusted net profit was €2.0 billion, up 91%.[34]
Logo[edit]
The new FCA logo was created by the Italian branding company Robilant Associati,[35][36] ending the use of the Fiat S.p.A. logo and Chrysler Pentastar logo for group branding.[37]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive. Between 2014-2018, the top of the line Maserati Quattroporte GTS will be receiving a 560-horsepower V8 with all-wheel drive to replace the current 523 horsepower V8 with rear wheel drive in the GTS model. The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]
Jeep[edit]
In 2014, the new Jeep Renegade launches. After a long absence in the Malaysian market, Jeep has once again landed in Malaysia. DRB-Hicom is exclusively appointed by Fiat Chrysler to distribute the brand’s cars in Malaysia.[33] In 2015, the Jeep Grand Cherokee will be refreshed, and Fan Bingbing, Tina Fey, Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett will promote as the brand ambassadors. 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Jeep, and the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot will see their last model year, and a new SUV will be launched, along with a refreshed Jeep Cherokee. In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]
Ram[edit]
In 2014, a ProMaster van was launched, along with the smaller ProMaster City, derived from Fiat Ducato and Fiat Doblò respectively.[27] In 2017, a new Ram 1500 will be launched, and a commercial light-duty truck will be refreshed. In 2018, a new Ram HD will be launched, along with a commercial heavy-duty truck, and Ram chassis cab will receive a major update.[27]

In 2015 worldwide shipments were 4.6 million units, revenues totaled €113.2 billion, up 18% (+6% at constant exchange rates, or CER), adjusted EBIT was €5.3 billion, up 40% and Adjusted net profit was €2.0 billion, up 91%.[34]
Logo[edit]
The new FCA logo was created by the Italian branding company Robilant Associati,[35][36] ending the use of the Fiat S.p.A. logo and Chrysler Pentastar logo for group branding.[37]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: Profit Up 15%, Debt Still High
Strong demand for a new Maserati SUV drove a year-over-year profit gain for FCA, but net industrial debt was higher than expected.

                (TMFMarlowe)

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) said its second-quarter operating profit rose 15% to 1.87 billion euros ($2.19 billion) on improved margins in North America and strong results for its luxury Maserati brand. But its still-high debt fell less than analysts had expected. 
All financial numbers are shown in euros. As of July 27, 1 euro = about $1.17.

High demand for the all-new Maserati Levante SUV drove a big gain in sales and profits for the Italian luxury brand, boosting FCA's profit year over year. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

FCA's second quarter: The nutshell summary
FCA's overall shipments were down slightly from a year ago, but profit increased on a much-improved mix of products sold. Maserati shipments nearly doubled on strong sales of its new Levante SUV, driving big gains in profit and margin. In addition, FCA was able to raise its margin in North America to 8.4%, from 7.9% a year ago, after discontinuing lower-profit sedan models to focus on trucks, SUVs, and higher-profit performance vehicles.
FCA's net industrial debt, a widely watched number, fell to 4.2 billion euros ($4.9 billion) as of the end of the quarter. That was short of expectations: Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a larger decline, to 3.9 billion euros. 





How FCA's business units performed in the second quarter
All of the profit numbers for FCA's regions and business units are presented as FCA reports them, on an "adjusted EBIT" basis. "Adjusted EBIT" is earnings before interest and tax, "adjusted" to eliminate the effects of one-time items. 

Profit in FCA's NAFTA region fell 2% to 1.35 billion euros, on 16.08 billion euros in revenue (down 8%). Shipments fell 14% to about 576,000 vehicles, in part because of some factory shuffling and in part because of the discontinuance of three lower-profit models from a year ago (the Chrysler 200, Dodge Dart, and Jeep Patriot). NAFTA's adjusted-EBIT margin was 8.4%, up 0.5 percentage points from a year ago. 
Profit in FCA's Latin America (LATAM) region rose to 60 million euros from a break-even result a year ago. Revenue rose 37% to 2.01 billion euros, for a profit margin of 3%. Shipments rose 18% to about 132,000 vehicles on improving economic conditions in key markets (Brazil and Argentina).
Profit in FCA's APAC (Asia Pacific, Africa, and China) region rose 5% to 44 million euros, on a 2% increase in revenue (to 976 million euros). Shipments rose 43% to about 80,000, driven largely by a ramp-up in production of Jeeps in China. APAC's adjusted-EBIT margin was 4.5%, up 0.1 percentage point from a year ago.
Profit in FCA's EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region rose 40% to 200 million euros. Revenue rose 4% to 6.01 billion euros on an 8% increase in shipments (to about 395,000). Margin of 3.3% was up 0.8 percentage points from a year ago.
Maserati's profit more than tripled to 152 million euros, as revenue rose 85% (to 1.07 billion euros) on a 91% increase in shipments (to about 13,200). Margin jumped to an impressive 14.2% from just 6.2% a year ago. The story here is simple: Strong global demand for the all-new Levante SUV drove the gains. 
FCA's Components unit includes suppliers Magneti Marelli, Comau, and Teksid. The unit earned 130 million euros, up 17%. Revenue increased 9% to 2.65 billion euros. Margin of 4.9% was up 0.3 percentage points from a year ago. Higher sales volumes across all three businesses accounted for the increase. 

Looking ahead: FCA's guidance
FCA confirmed its prior guidance for the full year. It still expects:

Net revenue of between 115 billion and 120 billion euro.
Adjusted EBIT of more than 7 billion euros.
Adjusted net profit of more than 3 billion euros.
Net industrial debt below 2.5 billion euros as of year-end.

Why Fiat Chrysler’s NAFTA Revenues Stayed Flat in 2Q17

Fiat Chrysler’s 2Q revenues
In 2Q17, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ (FCAU) total revenues stood firm at 27.9 billion euros, or about $32.6 billion. These revenues didn’t show any change on YoY (year-over-year) basis.

Consolidate shipments fell
The company’s consolidated shipments in 2Q17 stood at 1.13 million vehicle units, compared with 1.17 million in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects a fall of about 3% YoY in the company’s consolidated shipments.



FCAU’s combined shipments, which include shipments of FCAU’s joint ventures, fell ~1% YoY in 2Q17. The company attributed this fall in its combined shipments to capacity realignment plans and its transition to a new Jeep model in the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) region.
NAFTA revenues decreased
During 2Q17, FCAU shipped about 576,000 vehicles in North America, which was about 14% lower than the ~666,000 vehicle units it shipped in 2Q16. Due to these lower shipments, revenues from NAFTA region fell 8% YoY to 16.0 billion euros, or about $18.8 billion.
Due to FCAU’s lower NAFTA shipments, revenues fell in 2Q17. But factors such as favorable US dollar movement and positive product mix gave a boost to its NAFTA revenues.
Remember, FCAU reports its earnings in euros, and so it’s important for investors to pay attention to euro financial figures to get a fair idea of the existing trend. Still, Fiat Chrysler generates the majority of its revenues from North America, similar to peers (IYK) General Motors (GM), Toyota Motor (TM), and Ford Motor (F).

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, also known as FCA, is an Italian-controlled multinational corporation incorporated in the Netherlands,[5][6] and currently the world’s seventh-largest auto maker.[7] The group was established in late 2014 by merging Fiat S.p.A. into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands (with headquarters in London) for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan.[8] Exor S.p.A, an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.[9]
FCA’s mass-market brands operate through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles) and FCA US (previously Chrysler LLC). The company’s portfolio includes many well-known automotive names including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram Trucks, Abarth, Mopar and SRT. FCA also owns Maserati, Comau, Magneti Marelli, and Teksid.[10] Today FCA operates in four regions (NAFTA, LATAM, APAC, EMEA).[11]

Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO and executive management including twenty-two employees work between Auburn Hills, Michigan and Turin, Italy.[12] The other operating activities of the new group remained unchanged, with manufacturing, design and engineering facilities remaining in Turin, Italy, Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and other locations worldwide, including Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and China.
Board of Directors
Executive members of the FCA Board of Directors as of October 2014 are John Elkann (Chairman) and Sergio Marchionne (Chief Executive Officer), with non-executive directors Ronald L. Thompson, Andrea Agnelli, Tiberto Brandolini d'Adda, Glenn Earle, Valerie A. Mars, Ruth J. Simmons, Patience Wheatcroft, Stephen Wolf and Ermenegildo Zegna.[13]
Subsidiaries[edit]
FCA carries out its mass-market automotive operations through two main subsidiaries: FCA Italy (previously Fiat Group Automobiles)[14] and FCA US (previously Chrysler Group).[15] Both name changes were announced in December 2014.
FCA Italy includes the Italian-based brands that include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Lancia and the engine manufacturing subsidiary VM Motori.[16]
FCA US includes the American-based brands that include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram, plus the Mopar service and parts organization.
Other companies include luxury car (Maserati) and components (Magneti Marelli, Automotive Lighting) manufacturers as well as firms working on production automation (Comau) and metal foundry (Teksid, 84.8% share). Other joint ventures and subsidiaries are undertaken via the FCA Italy and FCA US companies.
In January 2016, Ferrari became a separate investment of Exor, siding with FCA and CNH, after FCA listed 10% of the company on the NYSE in October 2015, and then distributed their remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to FCA shareholders.[17]
FCA also operated in the print media and advertising fields through its Italiana Editrice subsidiary (publisher of the Italian La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers) and an interest in RCS Media Group.
In March 2017, FCA was a stakeholder in the creation of Italy's largest media group GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, created by the merger of Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso publishing L'espresso and La Repubblica with Italiana Editrice (ITEDI), of wich FCA held 77% of the shares and which publishes the Torino daily La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX. Subsequently FCA divested from publishing by distributing their shares to its own shareholders, again mainly Exor, so to concentrate on automobile business. Exor sold their shares in GEDI right after getting them.
History[edit]
The integration between Fiat and Chrysler dates back to 2009 after Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 30 April 2009. On 10 June 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company, and on 21 January 2014 Fiat completed the acquisition of the remaining 41.5% from the United Auto Workers, making Chrysler Group a wholly owned subsidiary.[18] Overall, to acquire Chrysler cost Fiat US$4.9 billion, with an additional US$5.5 billion pension liability.[19]
On 29 January 2014 Fiat announced a reorganization and intended merger into a new holding company.
Fiat S.p.A. merged into FCA on 12 October 2014 following approval of the board on 15 June 2014 and shareholders on 1 August 2014.[20]
On 29 October 2014 the group announced the intention to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA. The transaction was completed on 3 January 2016.[21]
On July 14, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne and Dennis Williams, President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) entered into negotiations on July 14, 2015.[22] As negotiations between the UAW and "Detroit Three automakers" began, "Marchionne leaned in to embrace Williams in a hug seen "round the world," shocking some union members.[22] When Marchionne made the announcement on January 8, 2017 that Chrysler planned to add 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to manufacture the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer at the Warren Truck Assembly and to make a new Jeep Wrangler pickup at its Toledo Assembly South plant in Toledo, Ohio by 2020, Marchionne credited the decision to the negotiations with Williams that began in 2015.[23][24]
On January 13, 2017, the company came under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department due to allegedly failing to disclose software that violated emissions standards and allowed vehicles to exceed pollution limits.[25]
On May 23, 2017, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit alleging that FCA "used a “defeat device” to circumvent emission controls" in more than 100,000 vehicles between 2014 and 2016. [26]
Five-year plan (2014–2018)[edit]
On May 6, 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its 5-year business plan.[27] The company expects that sales will increase to 7 million units, revenues to €132 billion, net income to €5 billion and industrial debt will peak at €11 billion in 2015, and then reduce to €0.5-1 billion by end of 2018.[28] The Group updated its business plan targets in January 2016 at the time FY 2015 were announced.
Much of the global growth will be focused around Jeep, due to its high visibility globally as well as the growing SUV market in developing markets. Chrysler will be re-positioned as the company's mainstream North American brand to compete with Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Volkswagen, while Dodge will focus on performance-based vehicles. Alfa Romeo will become the company's premium marque to compete with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi, while Maserati will be the company's ultra-luxury brand to compete with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Fiat (which will remain the company's mainstream brand outside North America) and Ram Trucks will remain largely unchanged, while SRT was merged back into Dodge.[29] Conspicuously absent in the announcement was Lancia, which was later confirmed to be withdrawing from all markets outside Italy, and possibly reborn 3 new models based on Fiat Tipo underpinnings altogether in 2018, and 1 new small car built in the same assembly line with Ford.[30]
Alfa Romeo[edit]
In 2014, Alfa Romeo launched the 4C and 4C Spider in the United States. In 2015, the new Giulia was announced. Additional vehicle launches were launched in 2016 and more are planned for the subsequent years.
Chrysler[edit]
In 2014, Chrysler released a refreshed 300/300C, set by FCA to debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. , A new Chrysler Pacifica In 2017, the Chrysler 200 will be discontinued. In 2018, an all-new 300/300C will launch, along with an all-new mid-size crossover.[27]
Dodge[edit]
The first announcement was that the SRT brand was to be put back into Dodge. In 2015, the refreshed Charger launched along with the refreshed Challenger (and equivalent SRT version). The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and Challenger SRT Hellcat were also launched.[31][32] 2014 was also the last model year for the Dodge Avenger. In 2016, the new Dodge Dart (and Dodge Dart SRT) was to be launched, along with a new Dodge Journey. The two models have since been either slated for discontinuation (Dodge Dart, 2016), or the date for the redesigned version was pushed back (Dodge Journey, 2018). In speculation, in 2017, a new Dodge Journey SRT will arrive, along with a refreshed Dodge Durango. In 2018, a new sedan and hatchback will launch, a new Challenger (and SRT version) will be unveiled, along with a new Charger (and SRT version).[27]
Fiat[edit]
In 2015, Fiat launched the new Fiat 500X (produced in Melfi, Italy) and the Fiat Aegea (produced in Turkey by JV partner Tofas and sold in Europe under the Fiat Tipo nameplate and Mexico as the Dodge Neon).[27]
Maserati[edit]
In 2014, the Maserati GranTurismo and GranCabrio will see the end of the nameplate (until 2018). In 2016, the new Maserati Levante SUV will be launched. In 2018, a new GranTurismo will be launched with a 560-horsepower V8 and rear wheel drive.

The top of the line Ghiblis and Levantes will be receiving the same setup as the Quattroporte. In 2020, the Maserati Alfieri will be launched. The car was originally going to be released in 2016, but was postponed to allow the Levante to be launched for 2016. The year after in 2021, a convertible variant of the Alfieri will be launched. The top of the line Alfieri will be receiving a 520-horsepower V6 with all-wheel drive.[27]

In 2017, the Jeep Renegade will be refreshed, a new Jeep Wrangler will be launched, and the new Grand Cherokee will be launched. In 2018, a Jeep Grand Wagoneer will be launched to compete with luxury SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Range Rover luxury SUVs.[27]

Management
        




Page ContentThe day-to-day operations of FCA US LLC are managed by a highly skilled and motivated management team comprised of experienced leaders from both FCA US and its parent, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. To facilitate collaboration and enhance speed of decision-making, management committees chaired by Sergio Marchionne, Chief Executive Officer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., meet regularly to consider significant operational matters. The Product Committee oversees capital investment, engineering and product development, while the Commercial Committee oversees matters related to sales and marketing. Both committees include managers from each of the companies’ brands (Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, FIAT, Jeep, Ram and Mopar), all of whom also have separate functional responsibilities across all the brands. We believe this structure further fosters cooperation, information sharing and timely decision-making.​

Fiat Chrysler’s 2Q revenues
In 2Q17, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ (FCAU) total revenues stood firm at 27.9 billion euros, or about $32.6 billion. These revenues didn’t show any change on YoY (year-over-year) basis.

Consolidate shipments fell
The company’s consolidated shipments in 2Q17 stood at 1.13 million vehicle units, compared with 1.17 million in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects a fall of about 3% YoY in the company’s consolidated shipments.



FCAU’s combined shipments, which include shipments of FCAU’s joint ventures, fell ~1% YoY in 2Q17. The company attributed this fall in its combined shipments to capacity realignment plans and its transition to a new Jeep model in the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) region.
NAFTA revenues decreased
During 2Q17, FCAU shipped about 576,000 vehicles in North America, which was about 14% lower than the ~666,000 vehicle units it shipped in 2Q16. Due to these lower shipments, revenues from NAFTA region fell 8% YoY to 16.0 billion euros, or about $18.8 billion.
Due to FCAU’s lower NAFTA shipments, revenues fell in 2Q17. But factors such as favorable US dollar movement and positive product mix gave a boost to its NAFTA revenues.
Remember, FCAU reports its earnings in euros, and so it’s important for investors to pay attention to euro financial figures to get a fair idea of the existing trend. Still, Fiat Chrysler generates the majority of its revenues from North America, similar to peers (IYK) General Motors (GM), Toyota Motor (TM), and Ford Motor (F).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
