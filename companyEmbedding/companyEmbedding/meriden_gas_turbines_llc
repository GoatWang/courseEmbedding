Start Preamble
        
        
        
        
        February 28, 2002. 
        Meriden Gas Turbines, LLC (Meriden Turbines) submitted for filing a tariff under which Meriden Turbines will engage in the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates and for the reassignment of transmission capacity. Meriden Turbines also requested waiver of various Commission regulations. In particular, Meriden Turbines requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by Meriden Turbines. 
On February 5, 2002, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates-East, granted requests for blanket approval under Part 34, subject to the following: 
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances of securities or assumptions of liability by Meriden Turbines should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Start Printed Page 10183Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). 
Absent a request to be heard in opposition within this period, Meriden Turbines is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of Meriden Turbines, compatible with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. 
The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Meriden Turbines' issuances of securities or assumptions of liability. 
Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is March 7, 2002. 
Copies of the full text of the Order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. The Order may also be viewed on the Internet at http://www.ferc.fed.us/​online/​rims.htm (call 202-208-2222 for assistance). Comments, protests, and interventions may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper. See, 18 CFR 385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's Web site at http://www.ferc.fed.us/​efi/​doorbell.htm.

its incorporation, organization or formation; if required by

authorization, execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement by that Member have been duly
taken;
 

(b)                                 
that Member has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and the other documents contemplated
herein, and they constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
of that Member enforceable against it in accordance with their

Members. Accordingly, the Members agree that the provisions of this

such Member must receive the
unanimous consent of the non-Disposing Members, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld by each of such other Members;
provided, however, that such consent need not be obtained if
(I) the proposed Assignee is a Wholly-Owned Affiliate of the
Disposing Member and (II) such proposed Assignee demonstrates to
the reasonable satisfaction of the other Members that it has the

Disposition has granted the Assignee either (I) the Disposing
Member’s entire Membership Interest or (II) the express right
to be so admitted; and (B) such Disposition is effected in strict
compliance with this Section 3.03.

Requirements Applicable to All
Dispositions and Admissions. In addition to the requirements set forth in
Sections 3.03(b)(i) and 3.03(b)(ii), any Disposition of a
Membership Interest and any admission of an Assignee as a Member
shall also be subject to the following requirements, and such

(which together must total the Sharing Ratio of the Disposing

ratification of this Agreement and agreement to be bound by it, and

Meriden Gas Turbines LLC, which has plans to operate a power plant in Meriden near the Berlin border, is donating the land with an agreement that it can operate utility easements on the property.

NEWSTown Set To Acquire LandBy VANESSA DE LA TORRE; Courant Staff Writer, November 18, 2006The town is set to gain 452 acres of open space near Chamberlain Highway in what will be the largest land acquisition for Berlin in recent years.

Pratt executives have blamed state government and organized labor for the high cost of doing business in Connecticut. Union leaders have blamed the company for subcontracting work out of jet-engine plants in the state.      Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has blamed Pratt for turning its back on its Connecticut heritage.NEWSTalks Progress On Land AcquisitionBy ANN MARIE SOMMA; Courant Staff Writer, May 23, 2006The town is one step closer to acquiring 452 acres of open space from a power company.      Negotiations are progressing on a land transfer agreement in which Meriden Gas Turbines LLC would donate the open space.      The planning and zoning commission hopes to consider an agreement at its meeting next month.      "The town wants to acquire open space in town to preserve its rural character, [and] this parcel will help connect areas of open space," said Jim Mahoney, the town's economic development director.BUSINESSPratt Creates Turbine DivisionBy SUSAN E. KINSMAN; Courant Staff Writer, November 9, 2000Pratt & Whitney Power Systems Inc. has formed a unit to push for a larger market share of the rapidly growing market for gas turbines for power generation and industrial use.      P2 Energy LLC will focus on marketing and sales of five industrial power systems ranging from 300 kilowatts to 50 megawatts.      The new company, to be based in Marietta, Ga., also has an agreement with Power Industry Consultants of Atlanta, a privately held company that provides siting, development, construction and operating services to companies interested in operating their own power plants.BUSINESSUtc, German Firm In Technology DealMarch 11, 1992United Technologies Corp. of Hartford said it completed an agreement with Siemens AG to provide the German power generation company with continuing access to aerospace technology developed by UTC's Pratt & Whitney division.      The agreement expands a 1988 alliance in which UTC's Turbo Power and Marine Systems, a Pratt unit based in Farmington, and Siemens' Power Generation Group, based in Erlangen, Germany, cooperated in producing components that could be used in Siemens' next generation of large industrial gas turbines for the electrical power industry.NEWSFormer Pratt Executive Is SentencedBy BILL LEUKHARDT; Courant Staff Writer, February 16, 2000A former Pratt & Whitney executive who robbed the firm of $381,000 by turning in dozens of phony expense vouchers was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison.      John Beliveau, 38, of Milford, admitted last July that he padded his expense account from 1994 to 1998 when he was a top official with Pratt's gas turbines division based in Rocky Hill.      In New Britain Superior Court Tuesday, Beliveau learned his fate: besides the prison term, he must pay $381,000 in restitution and serve five years of probation.BUSINESSStudy Group Backs Economic Power Of TurbinesBy MIRANDA S. SPIVACK; Courant Staff Writer, February 12, 1993Memo to President Clinton:      Looking for ways to return a peace dividend? A Connecticut legislative study group has an idea for you, one it says has the added appeal of being a relatively clean source of energy.      And all the group needs is maybe $15 billion of the $60 billion or more you hope to cut from the defense budget.      The product is gas turbine engines, a mainstay of the Connecticut manufacturing base that for decades has powered the war machine -- jets, helicopters and battle tanks -- and that now could be an instrument of peace.NEWSState At A GlanceNovember 18, 2006BERLIN -- The town is set to gain 452 acres of open space near Chamberlain Highway in what will be the largest land acquisition for Berlin in recent years. Meriden Gas Turbines LLC, which has plans to operate a power plant in Meriden near the Berlin border, is donating the land with an agreement that it can operate utility easements on the property. The land transfer could happen as soon as December, said Berlin Economic Development Director Jim Mahoney.      DURHAM -- Nearly 18 months after a fire destroyed The Time Out Taverne, the owners are poised to reopen the popular restaurant, which has been under construction since the summer.NEWSManufacturer Seeks To ExpandMay 23, 1996MAL Tool & Engineering is applying to the planning and zoning commission to expand its manufacturing space at 273 Adams St.      The manufacturer of blades used to operate airplane engines and industrial gas turbines is planning to expand its 20,000-square-foot factory by adding an additional 11,000 square feet.      The company's administrative offices are across the street from the factory at 280 Adams St.      Skip Kundahl, company president, said the expansion is necessary to provide more space to make a new product.Prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |  NextIndex by Keyword|Index by Date|Terms of Service|Privacy Policy|About Our Ads|About Us|Contact Us|Advertise OnlineBaltimore Sun|Chicago Tribune|Daily Press|Hartford Courant|Los Angeles Times|Orlando Sentinel|Sun Sentinel|The Morning CallHartford Courant, 285 Broad Street, Hartford, CT  06115Please note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors, reporters or any other editorial staff.

                            Turbine Inlet Air Chilling
                        





As industry leaders in turbine inlet air chilling technologies, Stellar Energy has designed and supplied TIAC systems for electric utilities, independent power producers, municipal power-generation facilities, industrial power islands and liquefied natural gas facilities across the globe.



Maximizing the Turbine's Potential
While gas turbines are very efficient power-generation systems, when the weather gets hot, they lose power output. Unfortunately this happens at the exact time when power is needed most, as more people turn on air conditioning, causing a surge in electricity demand.
However, by applying Turbine Inlet Air Chilling (TIAC) systems, power producers can avoid this output drop, improving their profitability and guaranteeing constant power production. By mechanically chilling the inlet air before it enters the compressor, TIAC gives the turbine a boost and restores the power produced to the nominal-rated output. The result is up to 35 percent more overall power output.

TIAC is a power enhancement applied to a gas turbine to enhance the power output, efficiency and operational flexibility of the power plant.


















                        Why Use Turbine Inlet Air Chilling?
                    



Maximize Existing Asset
While actual numbers depend on many factors, it is not unusual for a TIAC system to cost one-third the capital investment of a new turbine and half that of a new peaking plant (calculated in dollars per kilowatt).
Improve Heat Rate And Reduce Emissions
When installed on a combined cycle plant, TIAC can reduce emissions by providing peak capacity at combined cycle heat rates and lower emissions than a peaking plant. In addition, TIAC can be fueled by renewable energy or waste heat.
Enhance Operational Stability And Flexibility, Including Opportunity For Energy Storage
TIAC systems can incoporate thermal energy storage, shifting power required to run the chilling system to off-peak times, when power is in less demand. This increases the power available for dispatch during peak periods.
Improve Financial Performance
While actual numbers depend on many factors, it is not unusual for a TIAC system to cost one-third the capital investment of a new turbine and half that of a new peaking plant (calculated in dollars per kilowatt).
Improve Power Plant Life Cycle Cost
TIAC systems can be installed on combined cycle plants to provide peaking capacity with superior heat rates to those of simple cycle peaking plants. By improving the heat rate, TIAC increases the power per unit of fuel, thus making the gas turbine more efficient.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
