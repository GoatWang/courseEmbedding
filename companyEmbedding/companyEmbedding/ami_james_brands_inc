As a child of poverty and struggle, my initial ambitions were different than that of my peers. I wanted to be a catalyst for change, I wanted to be a chaotic rebel, I wanted to be – different. I sought refuge in a punk rock scene that spoke out against “the establishment.” My rebellious path and perceptions of reality all changed after I saw the best and worst of humanity during my time in the Israeli army. The proverbial “hindsight” is always 20/20  – and now as a father of 2 children I view the world through the perspective of a father and artist with a small taste of rebellion.  When the “Ink” Television opportunity presented itself, i saw it as an opportunity to speak out and try to make a small difference in the world.
The One thing that never wavered was my passion for Art.  As a punk rock teenager, the culture made me a product of the street. I fell in love with music, fashion, and art. Even if it was a Mohawk and ripped jeans, it said something about my beliefs and my opinions – that individuals could have a view about me before a word was ever shared. Now, as an artist with 30 years of worldwide influences from the streets to the walls of international galleries, I see again an opportunity, to speak to the world through “my art.”
The “Ink” shows changed the perception and acceptance of Tattoos worldwide. It went from being “faux pas,” to being an appreciated body art item in under a decade. There was a time when tattoos were the exception, now they are the rule – instead of your outfit speaking out about your beliefs, it is the collection of artwork on your skin. I do not need to tell you the success of when these two aspects of trend and inspiring images come together. Mainstream acceptance is further enhanced when top designers such as  Calvin Klein choose a tattoo covered brief model or when Pacco Rabon chooses a tattooed athlete for its fragrance ads. and their choice for a tattooed covered brief model, Pacco Rabon and a tattooed covered athlete for its fragrance ads.
This is the time to recognize the growth of this industry with such figures as 36% of Americans aged 18 to 25 have at least one tattoo, Tattooing is the 6th fastest growing retail industry in the world, more than 30,000 tattoo shops are operating in the US alone, the industry is Generating over Three billion dollars year, and 147 million monthly tattoo searches in Google alone, a number which has doubled since 2007. It is results and trends like these that have help build a solid foundation for my business ventures. Opening 5 tattoo shops in the US and Europe, a bar located in south Florida, and the newest and most unprecedented business venture, the opening of the Tattoodo website. We have incredible mile stones including hitting over 1 million viewers on our blog in one day, and becoming the most searched tattoo website within the first year of opening. Again, all this just speaks to the vast opportunity we have in this exact moment to create and achieve a perfect complement of art and clothing in the fashion industry.
Ami James Brands where Art is a
Reflection of Humanity.

Ami James Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: AJBI) engages in the designing, marketing, distribution, and sale of tattoo apparel, and accessories under the Ami James and Ami James Ink brands.  Shares of the tattoo branded company shot up 20% on heavy volume Wednesday, July 27, 2016. Over the past three months, Ami James Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: AJBI) has seen average daily volume of around 213,026 shares. However, already 280,300 shares or dollar volume of around $128,909 has already exchanged hands in early trading Wednesday.
Shares of Ami James Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: AJBI) received a nice jump after announcing that the company will be offering a new product line: Ami James Tattoo Wipes. With most of the tattoo industry still continuing to paper towels, management believes the new product line could capitalize on the $6 billion tattoo market and global $8.2 billion personal care wipes market. Here is the press release detailing of the new product:
MIAMI, FL–(Marketwired – Jul 26, 2016) – Ami James Brands, Inc. ( OTCQB : AJBI ) (“Ami James Brands” or “Company”), a licensing and brand management company with its core business rooted in the tattoo industry, is pleased to announce that its first foray into the post-tattoo care market will be with the introduction of its new “Ami James Tattoo Wipes.”
The Ami James Tattoo Wipes are a hypoallergenic blend of moisturizers and minerals that provide artists a dynamic product for application and cleaning during tattoo application, and also provide customers a safe, effective, and convenient post-tattoo care solution. The Ami James brand of personal tattoo wipes will improve, soothe, and protect sensitive skin with a natural herbal solution of Aloe Vera, Green Tea Extract, Tea Tree Oil, Chamomile, and Lavender; free from harmful chemicals, preservatives, alcohol, perfumes, and chlorine.
Total personal care wipes sales reached over $8.2 billion, and Euromonitor International attributes convenience and ease of use as the key drivers of consumer demand and growth. Coupled with a $6 billion tattoo market, the Ami James Tattoo Wipes target a broad audience which includes the 40% of Americans who have tattoos, as well as the over 30,000 tattoo studios in the United States alone.
“The concept of the tattoo wipe isn’t new. However, industry acceptance has been slow as artists still use paper towels. Having a brand of tattoo wipes that are artistic, trendy, and carry the Ami James name will enhance the consumer appeal and provide improved functionality that will also appeal to tattoo artists everywhere,” commented Ira Morris, Corporate Secretary of Ami James Brands.

Ami James Brands, Inc. to Develop National and International Tattoo Industry Certification and Accreditation Program Along With Branded Sanitary and Post-Ink Tattoo Care ProductsJune 22, 2016 |  About: 
AJBI  +0%




MIAMI, FL--(Marketwired - Jun 22, 2016) - Ami James Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: AJBI) ("Ami James Brands" or "Company"), a licensing and brand management company with its core business rooted in the tattoo industry, is pleased to announce it has initiated strategic legal and industry research in an effort to consolidate the fragmented tattoo industry through the development of a certification and accreditation program. 
Ami James Brands will work with an internationally recognized law firm to define a quality control system to enable the Company to provide high quality tattoo studios with a level of certification that will set the standards of service in a fragmented tattoo industry which generates estimated revenues of more than $1.65 billion annually in the United States alone (http://www.statisticbrain.com/tattoo-statistics/).
With over 35,000 tattoo studios across the United States, the federal, state, and municipal standards and regulations of tattoo providers are as fragmented as the industry itself. Ami James Brands believes this creates a large market opportunity for elite tattoo studios and artists to flourish and excel under an AJBI accreditation program that certifies their competency and strict adherence to best-practice guidelines. The proposed AJBI accreditation system will integrate current California legislation like the "Safe Body Art Act" into its overall program focusing on enhanced sterilization techniques, client records, continuing education, and client servicing. 

AJBI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AJBIPeter Lynch Chart of AJBIThe average cost of a tattoo is $150 an hour, so a significant amount of disposable income is invested in one's personal body art. It is imperative the tattoo industry offer the consumer an impeccable level of cleanliness and safety, and a complete suite of aftercare products and services to make sure the tattoo will last.
"The successful launch of an AJBI accreditation and certification program will give us a built-in platform to market our upcoming sanitary and post-ink tattoo care product lines," commented Ami James, president of Ami James Brands, Inc. "We are working on products to make tattoo artists' lives a little easier and guarantee consumers get superior products that will help with post tattoo recovery and longevity."

	GuruFocus Financial Strength Rank measures how strong a companys financial situation is. It is based on these factors

1. The debt burden that the company has as measured by its Interest coverage (current year).
2. Debt to revenue ratio. The lower, the better
3. Altman Z-score. 

A company ranks high with financial strength is likely to withstand any business slowdowns and recessions.

GuruFocus Profitability Rank ranks how profitable a company is and how likely the companys business will stay that way. It is based on these factors:

1. Operating Margin
2. Trend of the Operating Margin (5-year average). The company with an uptrend profit margin has a higher rank.
3. Consistency of the profitability
4. Piotroski F-Score
5. Predictability Rank

The maximum rank is 10. A rank of 7 or higher means a higher profitability and may stay that way. A rank of 3 or lower indicates that the company has had trouble to make a profit.

Profitability Rank is not directly related to the Financial Strength Rank. But if a company is consistently profitable, its financial strength will be stronger.

Ami James Brands, Inc. to Develop National and International Tattoo Industry Certification and Accreditation Program Along With Branded Sanitary and Post-Ink Tattoo Care Products




/EINPresswire.com/ -- MIAMI, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 06/22/16 --  Ami James Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: AJBI) ("Ami James Brands" or "Company"), a licensing and brand management company with its core business rooted in the tattoo industry, is pleased to announce it has initiated strategic legal and industry research in an effort to consolidate the fragmented tattoo industry through the development of a certification and accreditation program.


Ami James Brands will work with an internationally recognized law firm to define a quality control system to enable the Company to provide high quality tattoo studios with a level of certification that will set the standards of service in a fragmented tattoo industry which generates estimated revenues of more than $1.65 billion annually in the United States alone (http://www.statisticbrain.com/tattoo-statistics/).





With over 35,000 tattoo studios across the United States, the federal, state, and municipal standards and regulations of tattoo providers are as fragmented as the industry itself. Ami James Brands believes this creates a large market opportunity for elite tattoo studios and artists to flourish and excel under an AJBI accreditation program that certifies their competency and strict adherence to best-practice guidelines. The proposed AJBI accreditation system will integrate current California legislation like the "Safe Body Art Act" into its overall program focusing on enhanced sterilization techniques, client records, continuing education, and client servicing.


The average cost of a tattoo is $150 an hour, so a significant amount of disposable income is invested in one's personal body art. It is imperative the tattoo industry offer the consumer an impeccable level of cleanliness and safety, and a complete suite of aftercare products and services to make sure the tattoo will last.


"The successful launch of an AJBI accreditation and certification program will give us a built-in platform to market our upcoming sanitary and post-ink tattoo care product lines," commented Ami James, president of Ami James Brands, Inc. "We are working on products to make tattoo artists' lives a little easier and guarantee consumers get superior products that will help with post tattoo recovery and longevity."


About Ami James Brands, Inc. (AJBI)
Ami James Brands, Inc. is a licensing and brand management company with its core business rooted in the tattoo industry. From apparel and fashion, to consolidating the fragmented tattoo industry, artist and entrepreneur Ami James is arguably the most recognizable face in the tattoo world. The Company is based in Miami, Florida, the home of the legendary "Miami Ink" tattoo studio, the Love Hate Social Club.
