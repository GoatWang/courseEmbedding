 MASTER AGREEMENT  dated as of          .........4 March
2014............... 






 Macquarie Bank Limited ABN 46 008 583 542 (MBL and hereinafter included in the expression Party
A)
  
 Perpetual Trustee Company Limited ABN 42 000 001 007 in its capacity as trustee of the SMART ABS Series 2014-1US Trust (Party
B)

 Macquarie Securities Management Pty Limited ABN 26 003 435 443 (the Manager)
  

 have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a Transaction) that are or will be
governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the Schedule), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a Confirmation) exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions. 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:    


1.
 Interpretation  (a)      Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of
this Master Agreement.  (b)      Inconsistency. In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction. 
(c)      Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact
that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this Agreement), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions. 
 


2.
 Obligations  (a)      General Conditions.  (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. 
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account
specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such
delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no
Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.  Copyright © 1992 by
International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. 


(b)      Change of Account. Either party may
change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely
notice of a reasonable objection to such change.  (c)      Netting. If on any date
amounts would otherwise be payable:  (i)     in the same currency; and
 (ii)    in respect of the same Transaction, 
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each partys obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically
satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the
larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.  The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions,
regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being
subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions
and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.   


(d)
 Deduction or Withholding for Tax. 
(i)    Gross-Up. All payments under this
Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (X) will: 
(1)    promptly notify the other party (Y) of such requirement; 
(2)    pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including
the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
has been assessed against Y;  (3)    promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a
certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and  (4)    if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required
to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for: 
(A)    the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or  (B)    the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered
into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

(ii)    Liability. If:  
(1)    X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental
revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4); 
(2)    X does not so deduct or withhold; and 
(3)    a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X, 
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to
X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
 (e)      Default Interest, Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment,
at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
 


3.
 Representations  Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the
representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:   


(a)
 Basic Representations.  (i)    Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good
standing;  (ii)    Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any
other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance; 
(iii)    No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do not
violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or
affecting it or any of its assets;  (iv)    Consents. All governmental and
other consents that are required to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been
complied with; and  (v)    Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this
Agreement and any Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).

(b)      Absence of Certain Events. No Event of
Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.  (c)      Absence of
Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator
that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.
 (d)      Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect. 
(e)      Payer Tax Representation. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made
by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate and true.  (f)      Payee Tax
Representations. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.   


4.
 Agreements  Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party: 
(a)      Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in certain
cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:  (i)      any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; 
(ii)     any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and 
(iii)    upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or
reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or
with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such
form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification, 
in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.
 (b)      Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain
any that may become necessary in the future.  (c)      Comply with Laws. It will
comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is
a party.  (d)      Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a
representation made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such failure.

organised, managed and controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located (Stamp Tax
Jurisdiction) and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other partys execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not
also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.   


5.
 Events of Default and Termination Events  (a)       Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or
any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an Event of Default) with respect to such party: 
(i)    Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment
under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(ii)    Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any
agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii)
or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(iii)    Credit Support Default. 
(1)   Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement
or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed; 
(2)   the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such
Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit
Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or  (3)   the party or
such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;  (iv)     Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by
the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated; 
(v)     Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support Provider
of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of
obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange
date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or
rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf); 
(vi)     Cross Default. If Cross Default is specified in the Schedule
as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of default or other similar condition or event (however

ISDA® 1992


described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such
party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold
Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and
payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold
Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period);  (vii) Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party:  
(1)   is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent
or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or
has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry
of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or presentation
thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the
appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all
its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed,
discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in
clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or 
(viii) Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates
or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:  
(1)   the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such
Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or 
(2)   the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party)
to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement. 
(b)       Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if
applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below
or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event

ISDA® 1992



Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below: 
(i)     Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law after
the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes
unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party):   (1)   to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material
provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or  (2)   to perform, or for any
Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction; 
(ii)     Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party
(which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under
Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest
under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)); 
(iii)     Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the Burdened Party) on the
next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or
(2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of
Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where
such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii); 
(iv)     Credit Event Upon Merger. If Credit Event Upon Merger is
specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party (X), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all
its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support
Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or 
(v)     Additional Termination Event. If any Additional Termination
Event is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such
Confirmation).  (c)       Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or
circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.

 Early Termination  (a)       Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the Defaulting Party) has
occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the Non-defaulting Party) may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, Automatic Early Termination is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding
Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding
the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
 (b)       Right to Terminate Following Termination Event. 
(i)     Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon
becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. 
(ii)     Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early
Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all
its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist. 
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within
such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).  Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other
partys policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.  (iii)     Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all
reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.  (iv)     Right to Terminate. If:   (1)   a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days
after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or  (2)   an Illegality under
Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, 
either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party
in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one
Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then

ISDA® 1992



continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions. 
 


(c)
 Effect of Designation.  (i)     If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the
relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.  (ii)     Upon the
occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other
provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).   


(d)
 Calculations.  (i)     Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if
any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and
(2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining
such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation. 
(ii)     Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early
Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is
two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. 
(e)       Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following
provisions shall apply based on the parties election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either Market Quotation or Loss, and a payment method, either the First Method or the Second Method. If
the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that Market Quotation or the Second Method, as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an
Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.  (i)     Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default:  
(1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will
pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the
Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
Defaulting Party.  (2)   First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this Agreement. 
(3)   Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will
be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the 
 









 
9
 
ISDA® 1992


Non-defaulting Party) in respect of
the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party
will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.  (4)   Second Method and
Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party
will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
 (ii)     Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
Termination Event:   (1)    One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the
amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated,
Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.  (2)    Two Affected
Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:   (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will
determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the
party with the higher Settlement Amount (X) and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount (Y) and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the
Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and  (B) if Loss applies, each party
will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of
the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss (X) and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss (Y).  If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y. 
(iii)     Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date
occurs because Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or
deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii). 
(iv)    Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if
Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection
against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.
 Transfer  Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the
prior written consent of the other party, except that:   (a)       a party may make such a
transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
 (b)       a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount
payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).  Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this
Section will be void.   


8.
 Contractual Currency  (a)       Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the Contractual Currency). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than
the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of
the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount
in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess. 
(b)      Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order
expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement
or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled
pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund
promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at
which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the
currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term rate of exchange includes, without limitation, any
premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency. 
(c)       Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these indemnities
constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is
owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.  (d)       Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an
actual exchange or purchase been made.

9.
 Miscellaneous  (a)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.  (b)      
Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an
exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system. 
(c)       Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii),
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction. 
(d)       Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers,
remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.   


(e)      
 Counterparts and Confirmations. 
(i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in
counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.  (ii) The parties
intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in
counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding
supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation. 
(f)       No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege
in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  (g)       Headings. The headings
used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.   


10.
 Offices; Multibranch Parties  (a)       If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office
represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or
home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.  (b)       Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written consent of
the other party.  (c)       If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction will be specified
in the relevant Confirmation.   


11.
 Expenses  A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document

to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection. 
 


12.

deemed effective as indicated:  (i)     if in writing and delivered in person or by
courier, on the date it is delivered;  (ii)     if sent by telex, on the date the
recipients answerback is received;  (iii)     if sent by facsimile transmission,
on the date that transmission is received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and will not be met by a transmission report generated by the
senders facsimile machine);  (iv)     if sent by certified or registered mail
(airmail, if overseas) or the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is delivered or its delivery is attempted; or  (v)     if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic message is received,  unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the
close of business on a Local Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.  (b)       Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.   


13.
 Governing Law and Jurisdiction  (a)       Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule. 
(b)       Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this
Agreement (Proceedings), each party irrevocably:  (i)     submits to the
jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District
Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and  (ii)     waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have been
brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.  Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, the Contracting States, as
defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one
or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.  (c)      
Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any

 









 
13
 
ISDA® 1992



reason any partys Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other
party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
 (d)       Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

Specified Transaction.  Loss means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection
with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result
of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made
(assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include
a partys legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if
that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the
relevant markets.  Market Quotation means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions and a
party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount, if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by such party (expressed
as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction
(the Replacement Transaction) that would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each
applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have

 









 
15
 
ISDA® 1992



been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any
payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be
subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably
practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in
good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the
quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this
purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.  Non-default Rate means a rate
per annum equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if it were to fund the relevant amount. 
Non-defaulting Party has the meaning specified in Section 6(a).  Office means a branch or office of a party, which may be such partys head or home office.  Potential Event of Default means any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default. 
Reference Market-makers means four leading dealers in the relevant market selected by the party determining a
Market Quotation in good faith (a) from among dealers of the highest credit standing which satisfy all the criteria that such party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make an extension of credit and (b) to the
extent practicable, from among such dealers having an office in the same city.  Relevant Jurisdiction

Trust, as a result of Party Bs fraud, negligence or wilful default.

  31 




 
 
accordance with any such Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of such Relevant Party or any other such person.
  


 
(e)
 (No Authority): No attorney, agent, receiver or receiver and manager appointed in accordance with this Agreement or any Transaction Document
has authority to act on behalf of Party B in a way which exposes Party B to any personal liability and no act or omission of any such person will be considered fraud, negligence or wilful default of Party B for the purposes of Section 15(c).

 made in respect of a Replacement Transaction with terms that are, in all material respects, no less beneficial for Party B than those of this
Agreement (save for the exclusion of provisions relating to Transactions that are not Terminated Transactions or group of Terminated Transactions to be transferred following a Replacement Event (as the case shall be)), as determined by Party
B..   


 
(ii)
 In determining whether or not a Firm Offer satisfies the condition in sub-paragraph (D) of Market Quotation, Party B shall act in a
commercially reasonable manner.   


 
(iii)
 The definition of Settlement Amount shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
Settlement Amount means, with respect to any Early Termination Date: 
 


 
(A)
 if, on or prior to such Early Termination Date a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions (in
the case of a transfer, as if the Transaction was a Terminated Transaction) is accepted by Party B so as to become legally binding, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of such Market Quotation;
  


 
(B)
 if, on such Early Termination Date, no Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions has been
accepted by Party B so as to become legally binding and one or more Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount
(whether positive or negative) of the lowest of such Market Quotations (for the 
  39 




 
 
avoidance of doubt, (1) a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number and (2) the lower of two Market Quotations
expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value); or   


 
(C)
 if, on such Early Termination Date, no Market Quotation for the relevant Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions is accepted by Party B so
as to become legally binding and no Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party Bs Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid
amounts) for the relevant Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions..   


 
(iv)
 At any time on or before the Early Termination Date at which two or more Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of
becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party B shall be entitled to accept only the lowest of such Market Quotations (for the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market
Quotation expressed as a positive number and (ii) the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value). 
 


 
(v)
 If Party B requests Party A in writing to obtain Market Quotations, Party A shall use reasonable efforts to do so before the Early Termination Date.
  


(4)
 Hedge Provider and Prepayments: The parties acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of the Transaction Documents in relation to the
Series Trust:   


 
(a)
 this Agreement is a Hedge Agreement in relation to the Series Trust; and 
 


 
(b)
 Party A is a Hedge Provider.   


(5)
 Procedures for Entering into Transactions   


 
(a)
 With respect to each Transaction entered into pursuant to this Agreement and for the purposes of Section 9(e)(ii), Party A will, by or promptly
after the relevant Trade Date, send Party B and the Manager a Confirmation substantially in the form set out in Annexure 1 (or in such other form as may be agreed between Party A, Party B and the Manager) and Party B and the Manager must promptly
then confirm the accuracy of and sign and return, or request the correction of, such Confirmation. In the absence of manifest error where Party B or the Manager fails to confirm the accuracy of or request the correction of a Confirmation within
three Business Days after it was sent, the terms of a Confirmation will be binding on and conclusive against Party B. Delivery of a Confirmation is effected whether a party uses facsimile, an electronic messaging system or telex and irrespective of
the form of delivery used by the other party to confirm the terms of the relevant Transaction. The requirement of this Agreement that the parties exchange Confirmations shall for all purposes be satisfied by following the procedure set out in this
paragraph. Where a Transaction is confirmed by means of a facsimile, an electronic messaging system or telex, such message will constitute a Confirmation even where not so specified in that Confirmation. 
 


 
(b)
 Party B will enter into each Transaction in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust and not as trustee of any other Series Trust (as defined in
the Master Trust Deed). 
  40 




(6)
 Authorised Officer: Each Party will be entitled to assume, in the absence of any knowledge to the contrary, that any person signing any
Confirmation, notice or other written communication issued in respect of this Agreement on behalf of a Party is an Authorised Officer of that party.   


(7)
 Recorded Conversations: Each party:   


 
(a)
 consents to the electronic recording of its telephone conversations with the other party (or any of its associated persons) with or without the use
of an automatic tone warning device;   


 
(b)
 acknowledges that such recordings and transcripts can be used as evidence by either Party in any dispute between them; and
  


 
(c)
 acknowledges that neither is obligated to maintain copies of such recordings and transcripts for the benefit of the other party.
  


(8)
 Knowledge or Awareness: Subject to Section 12(a), each party will only be considered to have knowledge or awareness of, or notice of, a
thing or grounds to believe anything by virtue of the officers of that Party or any Related Body Corporate of that Party which have the day to day responsibility for the administration or management of that partys (or a Related Body Corporate
of that partys) obligations in relation to the Series Trust or the Transaction entered into under this Agreement having actual knowledge, actual awareness or actual notice of that thing, or grounds or reason to believe that thing (and similar
references will be interpreted in this way).   


(9)
 Disclosure to Related Bodies Corporate: In relation to information Party B in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust (the
Recipient) receives from any of the Manager or Party A (the Discloser) in relation to the Series Trust, the Seller Trust or the trust established under the Master Security Trust Deed (the Information), each
Discloser hereby severally authorises and consents to the Recipient making available such Information, except to the extent that the making available of such Information is prohibited by law (including, without limitation, the Privacy Act), to:
  


 
(a)
 any Related Body Corporate of the Recipient which acts as custodian or Security Trustee of the Assets of the Series Trust, of the Seller Trust or of
the trust established under the Master Security Trust Deed or which otherwise has responsibility for the management or administration of the Series Trust, the Seller Trust or the trust established under the Master Security Trust Deed, including
their respective Assets; and   


 
(b)
 the Recipient acting in its capacity as Manager, custodian or Servicer (as applicable) of the Series Trust, the Seller Trust or the trust
established under the Master Security Trust Deed.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Recipient will not have any liability to the Discloser or any other person for the use, non-use, communication or non-communication of the Information in the above manner, except to the extent to which the Recipient has an
express contractual obligation to disclose or not to disclose or to use or not to use certain information received by it and fails to do so.   


(10)
 Amendments to this Agreement:   


 
(a)
 The Manager must give 5 Business Days notice in writing to each Rating Agency of any amendments to this Agreement. 
  41 




 
(b)
 This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement between all parties to this Agreement, provided that the Manager and Party B may only agree
to such amendment in accordance with the provisions of clause 25 of the Master Trust Deed and for this purpose references in that clause to a Series Supplement will be taken to be references to this Agreement. 
 


(11)
 Notification of Principal Balance: On each Determination Date, the Manager must advise Party A of the aggregate of the Principal Balances of
all SMART Receivables expected as at the first day of the Interest Period following that Determination Date.   


(12)
 Anti-money laundering:  Each party (the Information Provider) agrees to provide any information and documents reasonably
required by any other party (the Information Recipient) to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing laws including, without limitation, any applicable laws imposing know your customer or
other identification checks or procedures that the Information Recipient is required to comply with in respect of this Agreement (AML/CTF Laws), but the foregoing obligation applies only to the extent that such information and such documents
are in the possession of the Information Provider or may be obtained by it after having undertaken reasonable steps and subject to any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations owed by the Information Provider to any person in relation to
whom the information or documents requested relate (except to the extent that the foregoing may be overridden by the relevant AML/CTF Laws). Each party must comply with any AML/CTF Laws applicable to it, to the extent required to comply with its
obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any party may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent that it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it has taken all action to comply
with any applicable AML/CTF Laws, it is required to decline to perform those obligations under any such AML/CTF Laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party and the Noteholders and Unitholders releases each other party (a Released
Party) from any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Agreement and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and privacy laws, but only to
the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this clause or any similar clause in any other Transaction Document.
  


(13)
 Regulation AB Financial Disclosure   


 
(a)
 Party A acknowledges that for so long as Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is required to file Exchange Act Reports, Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is
required under Regulation AB to disclose certain information set forth in Regulation AB regarding Party A or its group of affiliated entities, if applicable, depending on the aggregate significance percentage of this Agreement and any other
derivative contracts between Party A or its group of affiliated entities, if applicable, and Party B, as calculated from time to time in accordance with Item 1115 of Regulation AB. 
 


 
(b)
 If the Manager determines on any date of determination at any time during which Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is required to file Exchange Act
Reports, reasonably and in good faith, that the significance percentage of this Agreement calculated in accordance with Item 1115 of Regulation AB is or has become: (A) 10% or more, but less than 20%, or (B) 20% or more, then on any
Local Business Day after the date of such determination, the Manager may request Party A to provide the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure by making a Swap Financial Disclosure Request. Thereafter, the Manager shall inform Party A no later than ten
(10) Local Business Days following such time as (i) the Manager has determined that Exchange Act Reports are no longer required to be filed in respect of the Relevant Notes pursuant to Section 15(d) of the

  42 




 
 
Securities Act or (ii) Swap Financial Disclosure is no longer required to be included or incorporated by reference in such Exchange Act Reports. 
 


 
(c)
 So long as the Exchange Act Reports are required to be filed by Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited under the Exchange Act and Swap Financial Disclosure
is required to be included or incorporated by reference in the Exchange Act Reports pursuant to Item 1115(b)(2) or Item 1115(b)(1), as applicable, of Regulation AB, Party A, at its own expense, shall within four (4) Local Business
Days after receipt of a Swap Financial Disclosure Request, provide Party B and the Manager with the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure described in Part 5.B(13)(b) of this Schedule. 
 


 
(d)
 If Party A is not able to provide the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure in accordance with Part 5.B(13)(c) of this Schedule, then Party A, at its
own expense, shall secure another entity to replace Party A as party to this Agreement on terms substantially similar to this Agreement which entity is able to and will provide the Swap Financial Disclosure for such entity within the time period
specified in Part 5.B(13)(c) of this Schedule (subject to the issuance of a Rating Notification by the Manager).   


 
(e)
 The parties agree that, if permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure may be provided by Party A by incorporation by
reference from reports filed by Party A pursuant to the Exchange Act. The parties agree that, if Swap Financial Disclosure is provided by Party A as set forth in the first sentence of this Part 5.B(13)(e), each relevant person (including without
limitation any affiliate of the Manager) is authorised to incorporate by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus any such reports filed by Party A with the Commission pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act which
contain any required Swap Financial Disclosure. The parties also agree that, if Swap Financial Disclosure is provided by Party A as set forth in the first sentence of this Part 5.B(13)(e), each relevant person (including without limitation any
affiliate of the Manager) is authorised to incorporate by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus any documents filed by Party A with the Commission pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of the offering described in the prospectus of the Series Trust relating to the offer and sale of the Relevant Notes. 
 


 
(f)
 Party A shall indemnify Party B, the Manager and Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited, the respective present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents of each of the foregoing and each person, if any, who controls Party B, the Manager or Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the
Party A Indemnified Persons) and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject, under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: 
 


 
(i)
 any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A;
  


 
(ii)
 any omission or alleged omission to state in the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or 
  43 




 
(iii)
 any failure by Party A to provide Party B or the Manager with the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure when and as required under this Part 5.B(13);
provided, however, that, if Party A secures another entity to replace Party A as party to this Agreement pursuant to Part 5.B(13)(d) of this Schedule, Party A shall not be liable for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) to which any of the Party A Indemnified Persons may become subject arising out of or based upon a failure by Party A to provide Party B or the Manager with the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure following the provision of
the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure by the other entity to Party B or the Manager.  The
provisions of this Part 5.B(13)(f) shall not limit whatever rights Party B or the Manager may have under other provisions of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or otherwise, whether in equity or at law, such as an action for damages,
specific performance or injunctive relief.   


 
(g)
 Party B and Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Party A, the present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents of Party A and each person, if any, who controls Party A within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon:   


 
(i)
 any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus, other than any
Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A; or   


 
(ii)
 any omission or alleged omission to state in the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus, other than the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by
Party A, a material fact required to be stated in the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus, other than the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A, or necessary to make the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus,
other than the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The provisions of this Part 5.B(13)(g) shall not limit whatever rights Party A may have under other provisions of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or otherwise, whether in equity or at law,
such as an action for damages, specific performance or injunctive relief.   


 
(h)
 Each of Party B, the Manager and Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited shall indemnify Party A, the present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents of Party A and each person, if any, who controls Party A within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any failure by such party to deliver or otherwise distribute any Swap Financial Disclosure in the substantively identical form provided to any of them by Party A or as modified with Party As written
consent. 
  44 


The provisions of this Part 5.B(13)(h) shall not limit whatever rights
Party A may have under other provisions of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or otherwise, whether in equity or at law, such as an action for damages, specific performance or injunctive relief. 
 


 
(i)
 The parties agree that under no circumstances shall any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement referred to in Part 5.B(13)(g)(i), any omission
or alleged omission referred to in Part 5.B(13)(g)(ii) or any failure to deliver or distribute referred to in Part 5.B(13)(h) constitute the fraud, negligence or wilful default of Party B for the purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation Section 15(c) of this Agreement.   


(14)
 Reporting  Where Party A has an obligation to report any Transaction entered into under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(h)(5) of the United States Commodity Exchange Act and rules corresponding to such
section (together the Reporting Rules), it will: (i) report the Transaction on a timely basis and as required by the Reporting Rules; and (ii) otherwise act as the reporting party under the Reporting Rules.

 This Annex supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master Agreement referred to above and is part of its
Schedule. For the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1(c), 2(a), 5 and 6, the credit support arrangements set out in this Annex constitute a Transaction (for which this Annex constitutes the Confirmation).
 Paragraph 1. Interpretation 
Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Annex or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 10, and all
references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph
11 and the other     
1 This document is not intended to create a charge or
other security interest over the assets transferred under its terms. Persons intending to establish a collateral arrangement based on the creation of a charge or other security interest should consider using the ISDA Credit Support Deed (English
law) or the ISDA Credit Support Annex (New York law), as appropriate.  2 This Credit Support Annex has been prepared for use with ISDA Master Agreements subject to English law. Users should consult their legal advisers as to the proper use and effect
of this form and the arrangements it contemplates. In particular, users should consult their legal advisers if they wish to have the Credit Support Annex made subject to a governing law other than English law or to have the Credit Support Annex
subject to a different governing law than that governing the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement (e.g., English law for the Credit Support Annex and New York law for the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement).

Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 


provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 11 will prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, references to
transfer in this Annex mean, in relation to cash, payment and, in relation to other assets, delivery.  Paragraph 2. Credit
Support Obligations  (a)      Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4,
upon a demand made by the Transferee on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferors Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferor will transfer to the Transferee
Eligible Credit Support having a Value as of the date of transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Delivery Amount
applicable to the Transferor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i)      the Credit Support Amount 
exceeds  (ii)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return
Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date).  (b)      Return Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferor on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Return Amount for
that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferees Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support specified by the Transferor in that demand having a Value as of the date of transfer
as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)) and the Credit Support Balance will, upon such transfer, be reduced accordingly. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Return
Amount applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support
Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date)
 exceeds  (ii)      the Credit Support Amount.  Paragraph 3. Transfers,
Calculations and Exchanges  (a)      Transfers. All transfers under this Annex
of any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Interest Amount or Equivalent Distributions shall be made in accordance with the instructions of the Transferee or Transferor, as applicable, and shall be made: 
(i)      in the case of cash, by transfer into one or more bank accounts specified by the
recipient;

1995  2 


(ii)      in the case of certificated
securities which cannot or which the parties have agreed will not be delivered by book-entry, by delivery in appropriate physical form to the recipient or its account accompanied by any duly executed instruments of transfer, transfer tax stamps and
any other documents necessary to constitute a legally valid transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient; and  (iii)      in the case of securities which the parties have agreed will be delivered by book-entry, by the giving of written instructions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, instructions given by telex, facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the relevant depository institution or other entity specified by the recipient, together with a written copy of the instructions to the recipient,
sufficient, if complied with, to result in a legally effective transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient.  Subject to Paragraph 4 and unless otherwise specified, if a demand for the transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support is received by the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer
will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the date such demand is received; if a demand is received after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business
on the Settlement Day relating to the day after the date such demand is received. 
(b)      Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 2
and 4(a) will be made by the relevant Valuation Agent as of the relevant Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on
the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or, in the case of Paragraph 4(a), following the date of calculation).  (c)      Exchanges. 
(i)      Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11, the Transferor may on any Local
Business Day by notice inform the Transferee that it wishes to transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support specified in that notice (the New Credit Support) in exchange for certain Eligible Credit Support (the Original
Credit Support) specified in that notice comprised in the Transferors Credit Support Balance. 
(ii)      If the Transferee notifies the Transferor that it has consented to the proposed
exchange, (A) the Transferor will be obliged to transfer the New Credit Support to the Transferee on the first Settlement Day following the date on which it receives notice (which may be oral telephonic notice) from the Transferee of its
consent and (B) the Transferee will be obliged to transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support in respect of the Original Credit Support not later than the Settlement Day following the date on which the Transferee receives the New
Credit Support, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(d) (the Exchange Date); provided that the Transferee will only be obliged to transfer Equivalent Credit Support with a Value as of the date of transfer as close as
practicable to, but in any event not more than, the Value of the New Credit Support as of that date.

Paragraph 4. Dispute Resolution 
(a)      Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a Disputing Party)
reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agents calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then: 
(1)      the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the
Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the date of
transfer;  (2)      in the case of (I) above, the appropriate party will
transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2; 
(3)      the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute; and
 (4)      if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
 (i)      in the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return
Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:  (A)      utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute; 
(B)      calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in dispute
by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if four
quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agents original calculations will
be used for the Transaction; and  (C)      utilising the procedures specified
in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance; 
(ii)      in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit
Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).  Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than
the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make
the appropriate transfer. 
  ISDA ®
1995  4 


(b)      No Event of Default. The failure by a
party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this Paragraph 4 are being carried out. For the avoidance of
doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on the relevant due date. 
Paragraph 5. Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount 
(a)      Transfer of Title. Each party agrees that all right, title and interest in and to
any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or
encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).  (b)      No Security Interest. Nothing in this Annex is intended to create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge,
encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party to the other party under the terms of this Annex.  (c)      Distributions and Interest Amount.  (i)      Distributions. The Transferee will transfer to the Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or
other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions (Equivalent Distributions) to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the
Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose). 
(ii)      Interest Amount. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph
11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the
Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).  Paragraph 6. Default 
If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party, an amount equal
to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for purposes of
Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction constituted by this
Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid Amount representing the
Value of the Credit Support Balance.

Paragraph 7. Representation  Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent
Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security
interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system). 
Paragraph 8. Expenses 
Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer
it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party. 
Paragraph 9. Miscellaneous  (a)      Default Interest. Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due,
any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the
Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but
excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. 
(b)      Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable Manner. Performance of all obligations under
this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. 
(c)      Demands and Notices. All demands and notices given by a party under this Annex will
be given as specified in Section 12 of this Agreement.  (d)      Specifications of
Certain Matters. Anything referred to in this Annex as being specified in Paragraph 11 also may be specified in one or more Confirmations or other documents and this Annex will be construed accordingly.

                6Historia tego ratingu kredytowego odzwierciedla dokładnie aktualny stan wskaźnika (sf), ale ze względu na ograniczenia techniczne nie odzwierciedla dokładnie historii wskaźnika (sf). Zapraszamy do odwiedzenia zakładki “Research” aby zobaczyć artykuły prasowe, które zostały opublikowane, gdy wskaźnik (sf) został dodany lub usunięty.


        ​W odniesieniu do ratingów kredytowych określonych wyłącznie w oparciu o istniejący rating kredytowy programu, serii czy kategorii/klasy długu, podmiotu wspierającego lub podmiotu głównego o nadanym ratingu, a także w odniesieniu do ratingu, który zastępuje rating tymczasowy wcześniej przypisany na tym samym poziomie, Moody’s publikuje ogłoszone oceny ratingowe odnoszące się do danej serii czy kategorii/klasy długu, bądź całości programu, podmiotu wspierającego lub podmiotu głównego o nadanym ratingu, bądź dot. ratingu tymczasowego, podczas gdy w wielu przypadkach nie publikuje określonej oceny ratingowej każdej kolejnej emisji obligacji czy krótkoterminowych papierów dłużnych, w odniesieniu do których rating kredytowy jest pochodną istniejącego ratingu kredytowego. Ogłoszenia ratingów to z reguły komunikaty dla prasy klasyfikowane jako decyzje ratingowe (Rating Actions) ukazujące się na www.moodys.com. Ogłoszenia ratingu należy szukać na stronie Emitenta/Podmiotu w zakładce Analiz (Research).

        Pokud jde o úvěrové ratingy vycházející výlučně ze stávajícího úvěrového ratingu nějakého programu, řady, kategorie či zatřídění dluhu, poskytovatele podpory nebo již dříve hodnoceného subjektu, nebo o ratingy, které mají nahradit již dříve udělený prozatimní rating na stejné úrovni, vyhlašuje Moody's rating, který se týká této řady, kategorie, třídy dluhu nebo programu jako celku; zveřejňuje se též rating poskytovatele podpory, primárně hodnoceného subjektu nebo změny prozatimního ratingu. Moody's však zpravidla nevydává zvláštní oznámení ohledně ratingu každého následného dluhopisu nebo cenného papíru vycházejícího ze stávajícího úvěrového ratingu. Oznámení o ratingu mají obvykle formu press releasů, které jsou označovány jako Ratingové úkony, a můžete je najít na www.moodys.com. Tato oznámení najdete na stránce "Emitent /subjekt", pod záložkou "Výzkum".

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
