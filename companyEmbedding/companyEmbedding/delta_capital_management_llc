                                DELTA ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (DACM) is a firm organized to acquire and 
                                operate income property that can be enhanced in value though a combination of 
                                renovation, operational stabilization, and improved management. The company was

                                real estate.


                                DACM will build upon the existing business experience and relationships of its 
                                principals to garner product that will meet the company’s goals. Its principals

                                exceptional market position designed to develop a unique competitive position in 
                                successful property acquisition and maximization of cash returns. DACM is a
