Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC ( Guggenheim Funds or the sponsor ) serves as the sponsor of the trusts. The Financials Trust is scheduled to terminate in approximately two years and the US High Dividend Trust and the US SMID High Dividend Trust are scheduled to terminate in approximately 15 months. FINANCIALS PORTFOLIO, SERIES 5 Use this Investment Summary to help you decide whether an investment in this trust is right for you. More detailed information can be found later in this prospectus. Investment Objective The Financials Trust seeks to maximize total return primarily through capital appreciation. Principal Investment Strategy Under normal circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in common stocks issued by companies in the financial sector, as classified by Standard & Poor s Global Industry Classification Standard. The trust is concentrated in the financial sector and includes, but is not limited to, securities in the following industries: capital markets, banks, thrifts and mortgage finance, consumer finance, diversified financial services, insurance and real estate. The trust will not have a major emphasis on the real estate industry, but may include real estate stocks that exhibit compelling characteristics. The sponsor selects stocks for the portfolio that it believes have the potential to achieve the trust s investment objective. Security Selection The sponsor selects U.S.-traded common stocks that it believes are core holdings of a portfolio concentrated in the financial sector. To select the portfolio, the sponsor follows a disciplined process which includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The trust may invest in common stocks of U.S. and foreign companies that have small-, mid- and large-capitalizations. The sponsor begins with the approximately 670 stocks of companies that are classified as being in the financials sector and are members of the Russell 3000 Index. The sponsor then reduces that group of stocks by following a disciplined process based on, but not limited to, the following factors: Valuation. The sponsor may screen for reasonably valued stocks based on measures such as price to earnings and price to book. Growth. The sponsor may screen for companies with a history of better than average growth of revenues and earnings. Profitability. The sponsor may screen for companies with a history of consistent and high profitability as measured by return on assets, return on equity, gross margin and net margin. 2 Investment Summary3 Financial Statements. The sponsor favors companies which possess overall financial strength and exhibit financial statement strength relative to their peers and the marketplace. Industry Leadership. The sponsor favors companies which possess a strong competitive position among their domestic and global peers. Future Trusts The sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same general investment strategy. One such trust is expected to be available approximately six months after the trust s initial date of deposit (the Inception Date ) and upon the trust s termination. If these future trusts are available, you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge. Each trust is designed to be part of a longer term strategy.

No assurance can be given that the trust s investment objective will be achieved. The trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these: Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales of securities by the trust, government policies, litigation, and changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the trust are not deposits of any Investment Summary 34 bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The trust is concentrated in the financial sector. As a result, the factors that impact the financial sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust. Companies in the financial sector include banks, insurance companies and investment firms. The profitability of companies in the financial sector is largely dependent upon the availability and cost of capital which may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates and general economic developments. Financial sector companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, decreases in the availability of capital, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Negative developments initially relating to the subprime mortgage market and subsequently spreading to other parts of the economy, have adversely affected credit and capital markets worldwide and significantly impacted financial sector companies. The trust invests in securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. These securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of large-capitalization companies. Small-capitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments. Share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust. There is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and, if declared, whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time. Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments. The sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The trust will generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to buy, the same securities even though a security s outlook, market value or yield may have changed. See Investment Risks in Part A of the prospectus and Risk Factors in Part B of the prospectus for additional information. Who Should Invest You should consider this investment if: You want to own a defined portfolio of securities selected from the financials sector; The trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio; and 4 Investment Summary5 The trust is part of a longer-term investment strategy that may include investment in subsequent portfolios, if available. You should not consider this investment if: You are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities; You are uncomfortable with the risks of investing in the financials sector; or You want high current income or capital preservation as a primary investment objective. Fees and Expenses The amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect fees and expenses that you may incur based on a $10 unit price. Actual expenses may vary. Percentage of Public Amount Per Offering $1,000 Investor Fees Price (4) Invested Initial sales fee paid on purchase (1) 1.00% $10.00 Deferred sales fee (2) Creation and development fee (3) Maximum sales fees (including creation and development fee) 3.95% $39.50 Estimated organization costs (amount per 100 units paid by the trust at the end of the initial offering period or after six months, at the discretion of the sponsor) $8.00 Approximate Annual Fund % of Public Operating Offering Amount Per Expenses Price (4) 100 Units Trustee s fee % $1.050 Sponsor s supervisory fee Evaluator s fee Bookkeeping and administrative fee Estimated other trust operating expenses (5) Total % $2.167 (1) The initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the Inception Date. Because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee ( C&D Fee ) (as described below), the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin. Despite the variability of the initial sales fee, each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee. (2) The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.245 per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of $ per unit on the last business day of May 2016 and June 2016 and $ per unit on the last business day of July The percentage provided is based on a $10 per unit Public Offering Price as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary over time. If units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period, the entire deferred sales fee will be collected. (3) The C&D Fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust. The actual C&D Fee is $0.05 per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period, which is expected to be approximately six months from the Inception Date. The percentages provided are based on a $10 unit as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary over time. If the unit price exceeds $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will be less than 0.50% of the Public Offering Price; if the unit price is less than $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will exceed 0.50% of the Public Offering Price. However, in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed 3.95% of a unitholder s initial investment. (4) Based on 100 units with a $10.00 per unit Public Offering Price as of the Inception Date. (5) The estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately $45 million. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life, the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected. In some cases, the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected. Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees. Investment Summary 56 Example This example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge, the trust s operating expenses do not change and the trust s annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every $10,000 you invest: 1 year $ years years 1, years 2,444 These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment. The example does not consider any brokerage fees the trust pays or transaction fees that broker-dealers may charge for processing redemption requests. See Expenses of the Trust in Part B of the prospectus for additional information. 6 Investment Summary7 Trust Portfolio Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1369 Financials Portfolio, Series 5 The Trust Portfolio as of the Inception Date, October 15, 2015 Percentage of Aggregate Initial Per Share Cost To Ticker Company Name (1) Offer Price Shares Price Portfolio (2)(3) COMMON STOCKS (100.00%) Financials (100.00%) ACE ACE Limited (5) 2.98% 42 $ $ 4,433 ALL Allstate Corporation ,711 AXP American Express Company ,732 AFSI AmTrust Financial Services, Inc ,967 AIZ Assurant, Inc ,744 BAC Bank of America Corporation ,442 BBT BB&T Corporation ,718 BLK BlackRock, Inc ,515 COF Capital One Financial Corporation ,701 CFNL Cardinal Financial Corporation ,648 SCHW Charles Schwab Corporation ,750 CME CME Group, Inc ,453 EVR Evercore Partners, Inc ,029 FITB Fifth Third Bancorp ,727 FRC First Republic Bank ,687 GBCI Glacier Bancorp, Inc ,704 GS Goldman Sachs Group, Inc ,488 ICE Intercontinental Exchange, Inc ,670 JPM JPMorgan Chase & Company ,499 MMC Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc ,433 MET MetLife, Inc ,484 MS Morgan Stanley ,710 NBTB NBT Bancorp, Inc ,654 NTRS Northern Trust Corporation ,722 ORI Old Republic International Corporation ,727 PACW PacWest Bancorp ,709 PBCT People s United Financial, Inc ,681 PNC PNC Financial Services Group, Inc ,707 PVTB PrivateBancorp, Inc ,696 PGR Progressive Corporation ,450 PRU Prudential Financial, Inc ,749 RNST Renasant Corporation ,685 SEIC SEI Investments Company ,730 SFNC Simmons First National Corporation ,687 UCBI United Community Banks, Inc ,670 Investment Summary 78 Trust Portfolio (continued) Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1369 Financials Portfolio, Series 5 The Trust Portfolio as of the Inception Date, October 15, 2015 Percentage of Aggregate Initial Per Share Cost To Ticker Company Name (1) Offer Price Shares Price Portfolio (2)(3) COMMON STOCKS (continued) USB US Bancorp 3.00% 110 $ $ 4,455 WFC Wells Fargo & Company ,532 WTFC Wintrust Financial Corporation ,418 $ 148,517 (1) All securities are represented entirely by contracts to purchase securities, which were entered into by the sponsor on October 14, All contracts for securities are expected to be settled by the initial settlement date for the purchase of units.

More detailed information can be found later in this prospectus. Investment Objective The US High Dividend Trust seeks to provide dividend income. Principal Investment Strategy Under normal circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in dividend-paying common stocks of U.S. incorporated companies. The trust seeks to provide dividend income that is greater than its benchmark, the S&P 500 Index. The sponsor, with the assistance of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC ( GPIM ), an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, LLC, has selected the securities to be included in the trust s portfolio. The sponsor and GPIM believe that companies that distribute significant dividends on a consistent basis generally demonstrate strong financial strength and positive performance relative to their peers. The U.S.-listed common stocks held by the trust may include the common stocks of U.S. and non-u.s. companies. The trust will invest in securities of companies with mid- and large market capitalization and may invest in real estate investment trusts. Security Selection The trust s portfolio was constructed and the securities were selected seven business days prior to the initial date of deposit (the Security Selection Date ) using the Security Selection Rules outlined below. Security Selection Rules: In constructing the trust s portfolio, 25 securities were selected based on the following fundamentally based quantitative criteria: 1. Initial Universe: Start with an initial universe of all securities in the Russell 3000 Index as of the Security Selection Date. 2. Rank on Fundamentals: Rank every company identified in the initial universe against other companies in the same sector, as defined by Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), along each of the following reported financial metrics. Each ranking is determined as of the Security Selection Date using the most recently reported information and uses a scale of 1 through 10 (1 representing the highest scoring 10% in the sector and 10 representing the lowest scoring 10% in the sector): Return on assets as provided by S&P Compustat, and calculated as latest four quarters of reported operating income divided by the average of most recent reported total assets and year ago reported total assets. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the latest four quarters divided by enterprise value, as provided by S&P Compustat. Enterprise value is determined by adding the equity market capitalization as of the most recent closing price with the total outstanding long term and short term debt as determined by Investment Summary 910 the most recently available balance sheet, and then subtracting any cash and short term investments as determined by the most recently available balance sheet. Year-over-year growth in sales per share, as provided by S&P Compustat. Trailing year-over-year growth is the percentage change in sales per-share for the trailing 12 months versus the sales per-share from the prior 12 months. Sales per-share is the trailing 12 months of sales from the most recent trailing quarterly or semi-annual filings, whichever is most current, divided by the end of period reported count of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share. Each financial metric will create a separate score so that every company will have three scores. These three scores are averaged together to create one composite score for a company. This composite score is used to rank the companies in the next step in order to determine the sub-universe of securities. 3. Define Sub-Universe: Reduce the initial universe of securities to a subuniverse that meets the following requirements, with each requirement being applied independently to the initial universe from the other requirements in this step, as of the Security Selection Date: Exclude the lowest ranked 25% of securities from the initial universe determined by the average of the three financial rankings described in step 2. Exclude the 20% of the initial universe with the lowest trailing six month total return. Exclude securities which do not have a policy of regular periodic cash dividends (quarterly, semiannual or yearly), or have omitted the most recent regular periodic cash dividend. Exclude securities with a market capitalization less than $200 million. Market capitalization is determined by the closing price as of the Security Selection Date. Exclude securities with a liquidity of less than $0.6 million. Liquidity is determined by the median trading volume in U.S. dollars looking back 90 days from the Security Selection Date (i.e., trading volume each day in shares multiplied by the closing price for the day as provided by FactSet Research Systems, Inc.). Exclude business development companies as identified by Bloomberg Industry Classification System subindustry. Exclude mortgage real estate investment trusts, as identified by GICS sub-industry. Exclude securities that have a pending cash or stock merger and acquisition or bankruptcy which 10 Investment Summary11 will lead to delisting the security. Such events will be determined by reviewing the announced merger and acquisition data from Bloomberg. Exclude securities that are not one of the largest 500 companies of the initial universe by market capitalization (per FactSet). 4. Selection: Select from the subuniverse the 25 top dividend yielding securities (with higher rank given to larger market capitalization when yields are equal) and equally weight these securities as of the Security Selection Date. Selected securities must adhere to following portfolio limits as of the Security Selection Date: Maximum 20% weight in any GICS sector. Minimum 80% in U.S. incorporated companies. Once an investment limitation has been reached, additional securities of the type that would violate the limitation will not be included in the trust and the next highest yielding security will be used. Please note that due to the fluctuating nature of security prices, the weighting of an individual security or sector in the trust portfolio may change after the Security Selection Date.

The sponsor is also a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC. See General Information for additional information. Future Trusts The sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same general investment strategy. One such trust is expected to be available approximately three months after the initial date of deposit (the Inception Date ) and upon the trust s termination. If these future trusts are available, you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge. Each trust is designed to be part of a longer term strategy. Hypothetical Performance Information The hypothetical returns are not the actual returns of the trust and are not guaranteed. Simulated returns are hypothetical, meaning that they do not represent actual trading, and thus, may not reflect material economic and market factors, such as liquidity constraints, Investment Summary 1112 that may have had an impact on actual decision making. The hypothetical performance is the retroactive application of the strategy designed with the full benefit of hindsight. The following table compares the hypothetical performance information for the trust s security selection strategy (the Strategy ) to the actual performance of the S&P 500 Index, in each of the full years listed below (and as of the most recent month-end). Hypothetical performance of the Strategy is based on the assumption that the Strategy is used to select a hypothetical portfolio on the last business day of each year, the hypothetical portfolio is held for a one year term and then sold, and then a new hypothetical portfolio is selected by the Strategy. In the following table, Strategy stocks for a given year consist of the common stocks selected by applying the Strategy as of the last business day of each year, for example, the Strategy stocks for 2013 were selected by applying the Strategy as of December 31, 2012 (and not the date the trust actually sells units). These hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the trust. Hypothetical returns from the trust will differ from its selection strategy for several reasons, including the following: Hypothetical Total Return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on the purchase of the securities or taxes incurred by you. Hypothetical Strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent month), while the trust begins and ends on various dates. Extraordinary market events that are not expected to be repeated and may have affected performance. Hypothetical Strategy returns are based on hypothetical portfolios selected according to the Strategy on the last business day of each calendar year, while the trust has a maturity of approximately 15 months. The trust may not be fully invested at all times or weighted in all securities according to the Strategy at all times. This may happen because the trust may purchase additional securities to create units and such purchases may not exactly replicate the portfolio. In addition, the trust may sell securities to pay expenses, meet redemptions or to protect the trust and the sale of such securities may cause the trust to vary from the Strategy. Securities may be purchased or sold by the trust at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units. You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any index, and it is not expected that it will do so. In fact, the Strategy underperformed its comparative index in certain years, and the sponsor cannot guarantee that the trust will outperform its respective index over the life of the trust or over consecutive rollover periods, if available. S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization weighted Index of 500 companies (the Index ). The Index is regarded as a gauge for large-capitalization U.S. equities and covers approximately 80% of available market capitalization. Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the 12 Investment Summary13 securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. The Index is unmanaged and it is not possible to invest directly in the Index. The historical performance of the Index is shown for illustrative purposes only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or the trust, which will vary. Securities in which the trust invests may differ from those in the Index. The trust will not try to replicate the performance of these indices and will not necessarily invest any substantial portion of its assets in securities in the Index. There is no guarantee that the perceived intrinsic value of a security will be realized. Hypothetical Comparison of Total Return Hypothetical S&P 500 Strategy Index Total Total Year Returns Returns % 33.36% % 28.58% % 21.04% % -9.10% % % % % % 28.68% % 10.88% % 4.91% % 15.79% % 5.49% % % % 26.47% % 15.06% % 2.63% % 16.00% % 32.39% % 13.68% 2015 (thru 9/30) -8.48% -5.29% + These returns are the result of extraordinary market events and are not expected to be repeated. Hypothetical Comparison of Average Annual Return for Periods Ending December 31, 2014 Hypothetical S&P 500 Strategy Index Average Average Annual Annual Period Return Return 1 Year 10.72% 13.68% 5 Year 13.03% 15.57% 10 Year 8.64% 7.73% PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Past performance of the Strategy is hypothetical and does not represent any actual trust and is not guaranteed. It is shown for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate the future performance of any investment, including the trust. Hypothetical Strategy figures reflect the deduction of the maximum sales charge in the first year and a reduced sales charge in the remaining years to account for the rollover discount applied to a unitholder s proceeds that are rolled over from one series of the trust to the next. The hypothetical Strategy total return figures have not been reduced by estimated brokerage commissions and other transaction costs paid by the trust in acquiring the securities or any taxes incurred by unitholders. Hypothetical total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group of stocks between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total dividends paid on each group of stocks during such period divided by the opening market value of each group of stocks as of the first trading day of a period. Hypothetical total return figures assume that all dividends are reinvested monthly. Securities are selected through application of the Strategy as of the last business day of each Investment Summary 1314 year. If a security which is selected by the Strategy is merged out of existence, de-listed or suffers a similar fate during the period in which the hypothetical Strategy performance is being measured, such security will not be replaced by another security during that period and the return of such security will not be annualized in the calculation of the hypothetical returns.

No assurance can be given that the trust s investment objective will be achieved. The trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these: Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales of securities by the trust, government policies, litigation, and changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust. There is no guarantee that share prices of securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and, if declared, whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time. 14 Investment Summary15 Securities selected according to this strategy may not perform as intended. The trust is exposed to additional risk due to its policy of investing in accordance with an investment strategy. Although the trust s investment strategy is designed to achieve the trust s investment objective, the strategy may not prove to be successful. The investment decisions may not produce the intended results and there is no guarantee that the investment objective will be achieved. The trust includes real estate investment trusts ( REITs ). REITs may concentrate their investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, such as, hotels, shopping malls, residential complexes and office buildings. The value of the REITs and other real estate securities and the ability of such securities to distribute income may be adversely affected by several factors, including: rising interest rates; changes in the global and local economic climate and real estate conditions; perceptions of prospective tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the properties; the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act; increased competition from new properties; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; changes in real estate taxes and other operating expenses; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; adverse changes in zoning laws; declines in the value of real estate; the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market and the real estate market in the United States; and other factors beyond the control of the issuer of the security. The trust invests in securities issued by mid-capitalization companies. These securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of large-capitalization companies. Mid-capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments. Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments. The sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The trust will generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to buy, the same securities even though a security s outlook, market value or yield may have changed. See Investment Risks in Part A of the prospectus and Risk Factors in Part B of the prospectus for additional information. Who Should Invest You should consider this investment if: The trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio; The trust is part of a longer-term investment strategy that may include the investment in subsequent portfolios, if available; and Investment Summary 1516 The trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide diversification of method to your overall portfolio. You should not consider this investment if: You are uncomfortable with the trust s investment strategy; You are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities; or You want capital preservation. Fees and Expenses The amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect fees and expenses that you may incur based on a $10 unit price. Actual expenses may vary. Percentage of Public Amount Per Offering $1,000 Investor Fees Price (4) Invested Initial sales fee paid on purchase (1) 1.00% $10.00 Deferred sales fee (2) Creation and development fee (3) Maximum sales fees (including creation and development fee) 2.95% $29.50 Estimated organization costs (amount per 100 units paid by the trust at the end of the initial offering period or after six months, at the discretion of the sponsor) $8.00 Approximate Annual Fund % of Public Operating Offering Amount Per Expenses Price (4) 100 Units Trustee s fee % $1.050 Sponsor s supervisory fee Evaluator s fee Bookkeeping and administrative fee Estimated other trust operating expenses (5) Total % $2.208 (1) The initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the Inception Date. Because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee ( C&D Fee ) (as described below), the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin. Despite the variability of the initial sales fee, each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee. (2) The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.145 per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of $ per unit on the last business day of each month in February 2016 and March 2016 and $ per unit on the last business day of April The percentage provided is based on a $10 per unit Public Offering Price as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary over time. If units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period, the entire deferred sales fee will be collected. (3) The C&D Fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust. The actual C&D Fee is $0.05 per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period, which is expected to be approximately three months from the Inception Date. The percentages provided are based on a $10 unit as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary over time. If the unit price exceeds $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will be less than 0.50% of the Public Offering Price; if the unit price is less than $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will exceed 0.50% of the Public Offering Price. However, in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed 2.95% of a unitholder s initial investment. (4) Based on 100 units with a $10.00 per unit Public Offering Price as of the Inception Date. (5) The estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately $17 million. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life, the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected. In some cases, the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected. Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees. 16 Investment Summary17 Example This example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every year at a reduced sales charge, the trust s operating expenses do not change and the trust s annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every $10,000 you invest: 1 year $ years 1,010 5 years 1, years 3,329 These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment. The example does not consider any brokerage fees the trust pays or any transaction fees that broker-dealers may charge for processing redemption requests. See Expenses of the Trust in Part B of the prospectus for additional information.

Investment Summary 1920 GUGGENHEIM US SMID HIGH DIVIDEND PORTFOLIO, SERIES 18 Use this Investment Summary to help you decide whether an investment in this trust is right for you. More detailed information can be found later in this prospectus. Investment Objective The US SMID High Dividend Trust seeks to provide dividend income. Principal Investment Strategy Under normal circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in dividend-paying common stocks of U.S. incorporated companies with small- and midcapitalizations. The trust seeks to provide dividend income that is greater than its benchmark, the Russell 2500 TM Index. The sponsor, with the assistance of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC ( GPIM ), an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, LLC, has selected the securities to be included in the trust s portfolio. The sponsor and GPIM believe that companies that distribute significant dividends on a consistent basis demonstrate strong financial strength and positive performance relative to their peers. The U.S.- listed common stocks held by the trust may include the common stocks of U.S. and non-u.s. companies. The trust will invest in securities of companies with small- and mid- market capitalization and may invest in real estate investment trusts. The small- and midcapitalization companies will be the 2,500 smallest companies by market capitalization in the Russell 3000 Index. As a result of this strategy, the trust invests significantly in the consumer products sector. Security Selection The trust s portfolio was constructed and the securities were selected seven business days prior to the initial date of deposit (the Security Selection Date ) using the Security Selection Rules outlined below. Security Selection Rules: In constructing the trust s portfolio, 50 securities were selected based on the following fundamentally based quantitative criteria: 1. Initial Universe: Start with an initial universe of all securities in the Russell 3000 Index as of the Security Selection Date. 2. Rank on Fundamentals: Rank every company identified in the initial universe against other companies in the same sector, as defined by Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), along each of the following reported financial metrics. Each ranking is determined as of the Security Selection Date using the most recently reported information and uses a scale of 1 through 10 (1 representing the highest scoring 10% in the sector and 10 representing the lowest scoring 10% in the sector): Return on assets as provided by S&P Compustat, and calculated as latest four quarters of reported operating income divided by the average of most recent reported total assets and year ago reported total assets. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 20 Investment Summary21 the latest four quarters divided by enterprise value, as provided by S&P Compustat. Enterprise value is determined by adding the equity market capitalization as of the most recent closing price with the total outstanding long term and short term debt as determined by the most recently available balance sheet, and then subtracting any cash and short term investments as determined by the most recently available balance sheet. Year-over-year growth in sales per share, as provided by S&P Compustat. Trailing year-over-year growth is the percentage change in sales per-share for the trailing 12 months versus the sales per-share from the prior 12 months. Sales pershare is the trailing 12 months of sales from the most recent trailing quarterly or semi-annual filings, whichever is most current, divided by the end of period reported count of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share. Each financial metric will create a separate score so that every company will have three scores. These three scores are averaged together to create one composite score for a company. This composite score is used to rank the companies in the next step in order to determine the sub-universe of securities. 3. Define Sub-Universe: Reduce the initial universe of securities to a subuniverse that meets the following requirements, with each requirement being applied independently to the initial universe from the other requirements in this step, as of the Security Selection Date: Exclude the lowest ranked 25% of securities from the initial universe determined by the average of the three financial rankings described in step 2. Exclude the 20% of the initial universe with the lowest trailing six month total return. Exclude securities which do not have a policy of regular periodic cash dividends (quarterly, semiannual or yearly), or have omitted the most recent regular periodic cash dividend. Exclude securities with a market capitalization less than $200 million. Market capitalization is determined by the closing price as of the Security Selection Date. Exclude securities with a liquidity of less than $0.6 million. Liquidity is determined by the median trading volume in U.S. dollars looking back 90 days from the Security Selection Date (i.e., trading volume each day in shares multiplied by the closing price for the day as provided by FactSet Research Systems, Inc.). Exclude business development companies as identified by Bloomberg Industry Classification System sub-industry. Exclude mortgage real estate investment trusts, as identified by GICS sub-industry.

              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Strategic Income Portfolio (15-month), Series 72




GUGGENHEIM LOGO




PROSPECTUS PART A DATED OCTOBER 7, 2013



A portfolio containing securities



selected by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC


An investment can be made in the underlying closed-end funds directly rather
than through the trust. These direct investments can be made without paying the
sales charge, operating expenses and organizational costs of the trust.


The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or
disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this
prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.





INVESTMENT SUMMARY



Use this Investment Summary to help you decide whether an investment in
this trust is right for you. More detailed information can be found later in
this prospectus.



Overview



Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092 is a unit investment trust that
consists of the Strategic Income Portfolio (15-month), Series 72 (the "trust").
Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC ("Guggenheim Funds" or the "sponsor") serves
as the sponsor of the trust.


The trust is scheduled to terminate in approximately 15 months.



Investment Objective



The trust seeks to provide current income and the potential for capital
appreciation by investing in common shares of closed-end investment companies
("Closed-End Funds") that are considered to be income funds.


What is the Strategic Income
Portfolio (15-month)?


The trust is a strategic allocation by Guggenheim Funds of various
income-oriented Closed-End Funds containing securities of different asset
classes. These may include, but are not limited to:


o    high-yield securities or "junk" bonds;


o    convertible bonds;


o    preferred securities;


o    real estate investment trusts ("REITs");


o    corporate bonds;


o    government bonds;


o    international bonds; and


o    equities.



Principal Investment Strategy



The trust will invest 100% of its assets in Closed-End Funds that are
considered to be income funds. Guggenheim Funds, through proprietary research
and strategic alliances, will strive to select Closed-End Funds featuring the
potential for current income, diversification and overall liquidity.


See "Investment Policies" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.



Security Selection



The sponsor has selected Closed-End Funds for the portfolio believed to
have the best potential to achieve the trust's investment objective. The
Closed-End Funds' portfolios consist primarily of income-producing securities,
including: high-yield securities or "junk" bonds, convertible bonds, preferred
securities, REITs, corporate bonds, government bonds, international bonds and
equities.


When selecting Closed-End Funds for inclusion in the portfolio the sponsor
looks at numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:


o    Investment Objective. The sponsor favors funds that have a clear
investment objective in line with the trust's objective and, based
upon a review of publicly available information, appear to be
maintaining it.


o    Premium/Discount. The sponsor favors funds that are trading at a
discount relative to their peers and relative to their long-term
average.


o    Consistent Dividend. The sponsor favors funds that have a history of
paying a consistent and competitive dividend.


o    Performance. The sponsor favors funds that have a history of strong
relative performance (based on market price and net asset value) when
compared to their peers and an applicable index.



Future Trusts



The sponsor intends to create future trusts that follow the same
investment strategy. One such trust is expected to be available approximately
three months after the trust's initial date of deposit (the "Inception Date")
and upon the trust's termination. If these future trusts are available, you may
be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge. Each
trust is designed to be part of a longer term strategy.

Principal Risks



As with all investments, you may lose some or all of your investment in
the trust. No assurance can be given that the trust's investment objective will
be achieved. The trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can
happen for reasons such as these:


o    Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may
fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various
factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales
of securities by the trust, government policies, litigation, and
changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the
securities' issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the
trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency.


o    Due to the current state of the economy, the value of the securities
held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased
volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
Starting in December 2007, economic activity declined across all
sectors of the economy, and the United States experienced increased
unemployment. The economic crisis affected the global economy with
European and Asian markets also suffering historic losses. In
addition, Standard & Poor's Rating Services lowered its long-term
sovereign credit rating on the United States to "AA+" from "AAA."
Effects of the economic crisis can still be felt in many countries
around the world and may have an impact on the securities held by the
trust.


o    The trust includes Closed-End Funds. Closed-End Funds are actively
managed investment companies that invest in various types of
securities. Closed-End Funds issue common shares that are traded on a
securities exchange. Closed-End Funds are subject to various risks,
including management's ability to meet the Closed-End Fund's
investment objective and to manage the Closed-End Fund's portfolio
during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions
regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying investments change.
Closed-End Funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder
and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset
value. Closed-End Funds may also employ the use of leverage which
increases risk and volatility. Instability in the auction rate
preferred shares market may affect the volatility of Closed-End Funds
that use such instruments to provide leverage.


o    The Closed-End Funds are subject to annual fees and expenses,
including a management fee. Unitholders of the trust will bear these
fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust. See "Fees and
Expenses" for additional information.


o    The value of the fixed-income securities in the Closed-End Funds will
generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Typically,
fixed-income securities with longer periods before maturity are more
sensitive to interest rate changes.


o    A Closed-End Fund or an issuer of securities held by a Closed-End Fund
may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments and/or to
declare distributions in the future, may call a security before its
stated maturity, or may reduce the level of distributions declared.
This may result in a reduction in the value of your units.


o    The financial condition of a Closed-End Fund or an issuer of
securities held by a Closed-End Fund may worsen, resulting in a
reduction in the value of your units. This may occur at any point in
time, including during the primary offering period.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in preferred
securities. Preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds
and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms
of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to
greater credit risk than those debt instruments.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in securities that
are rated below investment-grade and are considered to be "junk"
securities. Below investment-grade obligations are considered to be
speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks, and
accordingly, the risk of non-payment or default is higher than with
investment-grade securities. In addition, such securities may be more
sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early
returns of principal.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest in securities
that are rated as investment-grade by only one rating agency. As a
result, such split-rated securities may have more speculative
characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than
securities rated as investment-grade by more than one rating agency.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in convertible
securities. Convertible securities generally offer lower interest or
dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-income securities of
similar credit quality because of the potential for capital
appreciation. The market values of convertible securities tend to
decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as
interest rates decline. However, a convertible security's market value
also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the
issuing company, particularly when that stock price is greater than
the convertible security's "conversion price." Convertible securities
fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference
or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or
rated lower than such debt obligations.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in call options. The
call writing portion of the investment strategy of the Closed-End
Funds may not be successful in that the Closed-End Funds may not
realize the full appreciation of stocks on which the Closed-End Funds
have written call options. The ability to successfully implement the
Closed-End Fund's investment strategy depends on the Closed-End Fund's
adviser's ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot
be assured.


o    The value of a call option held by a Closed-End Fund may be adversely
affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller.
The value of an option will be affected by changes in the value and
dividend rates of the stock subject to the option, an increase in
interest rates, a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the
stock market and the common stock, and the remaining time to
expiration.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in foreign
securities. Investment in foreign securities presents additional risk.
Foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile
than U.S. securities due to such factors as adverse economic,
currency, political, social or regulatory developments in a country,
including government seizure of assets, excessive taxation,
limitations on the use or transfer of assets, the lack of liquidity or
regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing
legal and/or accounting standards.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in securities issued
by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to
be emerging markets. Emerging markets are generally defined as
countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their
industrialization cycles. Risks of investing in developing or emerging
countries include the possibility of investment and trading
limitations, liquidity concerns, delays and disruptions in settlement
transactions, political uncertainties and dependence on international
trade and development assistance. Companies headquartered in emerging
market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest in REITs and
other real estate securities. REITs may concentrate their investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, such as
hotels, shopping malls, residential complexes and office buildings.
The value of the REIT and the ability of the REIT to distribute income
may be adversely affected by several factors, including: rising
interest rates; changes in the national, state and local economic
climate and real estate conditions; perceptions of prospective tenants
about the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the properties;
the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance; the cost of complying with the Americans with
Disabilities Act; increased competition from new properties; the
impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance
with environmental laws; changes in real estate taxes and other
operating expenses; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal
policies; adverse changes in zoning laws; declines in the value of
real estate; the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market and
the real estate markets in the United States; and other factors beyond
the control of the issuer of the REIT.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in common stocks.
Common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a
company. Common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including
changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an
issuer, changes in the general condition of the relevant stock market,
such as the market volatility recently exhibited, or when political or
economic events affect the issuers. Common stock prices may also be
particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of
capital rises and borrowing costs increase.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest in securities
issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. These
securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of
large-capitalization companies. Small-capitalization and
mid-capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets
or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general
market or economic developments.


o    Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest in senior loans.
Borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay
principal or interest when due. This non-payment would result in a
reduction of income to the applicable Closed-End Fund, a reduction in
the value of the senior loan experiencing non-payment and a decrease
in the net asset value of the Closed-End Fund. Although senior loans
in which the Closed-End Funds invest may be secured by specific
collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral
would satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-payment of
scheduled principal or interest or that such collateral could be
readily liquidated.


Senior loans in which the Closed-End Funds invest:


--   generally are of below investment-grade credit quality;


--   may be unrated at the time of investment;


--   generally are not registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") or any state securities commission; and


--   generally are not listed on any securities exchange.


In addition, the amount of public information available on senior
loans generally is less extensive than that available for other types
of assets.


o    Economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater
volatility. The markets for fixed-income securities, such as those
held by certain Closed-End Funds, may experience periods of
illiquidity and volatility. General market uncertainty and consequent
repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers,
which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in
a variety of fixed-income securities. These conditions resulted, and
in many cases continue to result in, greater volatility, less
liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency,
with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value.
These market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities
held by a Closed-End Fund uncertain and/or result in sudden and
significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings.


o    Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from
investments.


o    The sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The trust will
generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to
buy, the same securities even though a security's outlook, market
value or yield may have changed.


See "Investment Risks" in Part A of the prospectus and "Risk Factors" in
Part B of the prospectus for additional information.



Who Should Invest

include investment in subsequent trusts, if available.


You should not consider this investment if:


o    You are unwilling to accept the risks involved with owning Closed-End
Funds;


o    You are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in
securities;


o    You are seeking capital preservation as a primary investment
objective; or

(1)  The initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the
Inception Date. Because the initial sales fee equals the difference between
the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and
the creation and development fee ("C&D Fee") (as described below), the
percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit
price varies and after deferred fees begin. Despite the variability of the
initial sales fee, each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable
maximum sales fee.


(2)  The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.145 per unit and is deducted in
monthly installments of $0.0483 per unit on the last business day of
February 2014 and March 2014 and $0.0484 per unit on the last business day
of April 2014. The percentage provided is based on a $10 per unit Public
Offering Price as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary
over time. If units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period,
the entire deferred sales fee will be collected.


(3)  The C&D Fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust.
The actual C&D Fee is $0.05 per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the
close of the initial offering period, which is expected to be approximately
three months from the Inception Date. The percentages provided are based on
a $10 unit as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary
over time. If the unit price exceeds $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will be
less than 0.50% of the Public Offering Price; if the unit price is less
than $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will exceed 0.50% of the Public Offering
Price. However, in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed 2.95% of a
unitholder's initial investment.


(4)  Based on 100 units with a $10.00 per unit Public Offering Price as of the
Inception Date.


(5)  The estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust
size of approximately $12 million. Because certain of the operating
expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach such estimated size
or falls below the estimated size over its life, the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected. In some cases, the
actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts
reflected. Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and
other transactional fees.


(6)  Although not an actual trust operating expense, the trust, and therefore
the unitholders of the trust, will indirectly bear similar operating
expenses of the Closed-End Funds held by the trust in the estimated amount
provided above. Estimated Closed-End Fund expenses are based upon the net
asset value of the number of Closed-End Fund shares held by the trust per
unit multiplied by the Annual Operating Expenses of the Closed-End Funds
for the most recent fiscal year. Unitholders will therefore indirectly pay
higher expenses than if the underlying Closed-End Funds were held directly.
Please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service
provider to certain Closed-End Funds held by your trust and therefore
certain fees paid by your trust to such Closed-End Funds will be paid to
the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such Closed-End Funds.





Example



This example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that you reinvest your
investment in a new trust every year at a reduced sales charge, the trust's
operating expenses do not change and the trust's annual return is 5%. Your
actual returns and expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would
pay these expenses for every $10,000 you invest:






1 year   $     563
3 years      1,482
5 years      2,403
10 years     4,716








These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment
at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment. The example does
not consider any brokerage fees or transaction fees that broker-dealers may
charge for processing redemption requests.


See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.

(1)  All securities are represented entirely by contracts to purchase
securities, which were entered into by the sponsor on October 4, 2013. All
contracts for securities are expected to be settled by the initial
settlement date for the purchase of units.


(2)  Valuation of securities by the trustee was performed as of the Evaluation
Time on October 4, 2013. For securities quoted on a national exchange,
including the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., securities are generally valued at
the closing sales price using the market value per share. For foreign
securities traded on a foreign exchange, securities are generally valued at
the closing sale prices on the applicable exchange converted into U.S.
dollars. The trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to
security prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for
identical securities.


(3)  There was a $261 loss to the sponsor on the Inception Date.





UNDERSTANDING YOUR INVESTMENTS




How to Buy Units



You can buy units of your trust on any business day by contacting your
financial professional. Public offering prices of units are available daily on
the Internet at www.guggenheiminvestments.com. The unit price includes:


o    the value of the securities,


o    organization costs,


o    the maximum sales fee (which includes an initial sales fee, a deferred
sales fee and the creation and development fee), and


o    cash and other net assets in the portfolio.


We often refer to the purchase price of units as the "offer price" or the
"Public Offering Price." We must receive your order to buy units prior to the
close of the New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) to give
you the price for that day. If we receive your order after this time, you will
receive the price computed on the next business day.


Value of the Securities. The sponsor serves as the evaluator of your trust
(the "evaluator"). We cause the trustee to determine the value of the
securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on each day that the
exchange is open (the "Evaluation Time").


Pricing the Securities. The value of securities is generally determined by
using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign
securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. In some cases we will price a
security based on the last asked or bid price in the over-the-counter market or
by using other recognized pricing methods. We will only do this if a security is
not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market, or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.


The trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in
"Trust Portfolio" for your trust in this prospectus. Such prices were
determined as described above at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on
the business day before the date of this prospectus. On the first day we sell
units we will compute the unit price as of the close of the New York Stock
Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission becomes effective, if later.


Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of your
purchase price includes a per unit amount sufficient to reimburse us for some
or all of the costs of creating your trust. These costs include the costs of
preparing the registration statement and legal documents, legal fees, federal
and state registration fees, the portfolio consulting fee, if applicable, and
the initial fees and expenses of the trustee. Your trust will sell securities
to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or
after six months, at the discretion of the sponsor. Organization costs will not
exceed the estimate set forth under "Fees and Expenses."


Transactional Sales Fee. You pay a fee when you buy units. We refer to this
fee as the "transactional sales fee." The transactional sales fee of the trust
has both an initial and a deferred component and is 2.45% of the Public Offering
Price based on a $10 unit. The percentage amount of the transactional sales fee
is based on the unit price on the Inception Date. Because the transactional
sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the C&D Fee,
the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
unit price varies.


The transactional sales fee does not include the C&D Fee which is
described under "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus and in
"Fees and Expenses" in Part A of the prospectus.


Initial Sales Fee. Based on a $10 unit, the initial sales fee of the trust
is initially 1% of the Public Offering Price. The initial sales fee, which you
will pay at the time of purchase, is equal to the difference between the
maximum sales fee (2.95% of the Public Offering Price and the sum of the
maximum remaining deferred sales fees and the C&D Fee (initially $0.195 per
unit). The dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales fee will
vary over time.


Deferred Sales Fee. We defer payment of the rest of the transactional
sales fee through the deferred sales fee ($0.145 per unit). You pay any
remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem units. Your trust may sell
securities to meet the trust's obligations with respect to the deferred sales
fee. Thus, no assurance can be given that the trust will retain its present
size and composition for any length of time.


In limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of
unitholders, the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales fee from
the dates listed under "Fees and Expenses."


Reducing Your Sales Fee. We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
maximum sales fee you pay. It is your financial professional's responsibility to
alert us of any discount when you order units. Since the deferred sales fee and
the C&D Fee are a fixed dollar amount per unit, your trust must charge the
deferred sales fee and the C&D Fee per unit regardless of any discounts.
However, when you purchase units of your trust, if you are eligible to receive a
discount such that your total maximum sales fee is less than the fixed dollar
amount of the deferred sales fee and the C&D Fee, the sponsor will credit you
the difference between your maximum sales fee and the sum of the deferred sales
fee and the C&D Fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional
units.


Large Purchases. You can reduce your maximum sales fee by increasing the
size of your investment.


Investors who make large purchases are entitled to the following sales
charge reductions:








                      Sales Charge
                    Reductions (as a
                    % of the Public
Purchase Amount     Offering Price)
------------------------------------
Less than $50,000         0.00%
$50,000 - $99,999         0.25
$100,000 - $249,999       0.50
$250,000 - $499,999       0.75
$500,000 - $999,999       1.00
$1,000,000 or more        1.50








Aggregate unit purchases of any Guggenheim Funds trust by the same person
on any single day from any one broker-dealer qualify for a purchase level. You
can include these purchases as your own for purposes of this aggregation:


o    purchases by your spouse or children under the age of 21 living in the
smae household, and


o    purchases by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.


The discounts described above apply only during the initial offering
period.


There can be no assurance that the sponsor will create future trusts with
investment strategies similar to your trust or that may fit within your
investment parameters.


Advisory and Fee Accounts. We eliminate your transactional sales fee for
purchases made through registered investment advisers, certified financial
planners or registered broker-dealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of
commissions or who charge for financial planning or for investment advisory or
asset management services or provide these services as part of an investment
account where a comprehensive "wrap fee" is imposed (a "Fee Account").


This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the
secondary market. Your financial professional may purchase units with the Fee
Account CUSIP numbers to facilitate purchases under this discount, however, we
do not require that you buy units with these CUSIP numbers to qualify for the
discount. If you purchase units with these special CUSIP numbers, you should be
aware that you may have the distributions automatically reinvest into
additional units of your trust or receive cash distributions. We reserve the
right to limit or deny purchases of units not subject to the transactional
sales fee by investors whose frequent trading activity we determine to be
detrimental to your trust. We, as sponsor, will receive and you will pay the
C&D Fee. See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.


Exchange or Rollover Option. If you are buying units of your trust in the
primary market with redemption or termination proceeds from any unit trust, you
may purchase units at 99% of the maximum Public Offering Price, which may
include an up-front sales fee and a deferred sales fee. To qualify for this
sales charge reduction, the termination or redemption proceeds being used to
purchase units of your trust must be no more than 30 days old. Such purchases
entitled to this sales charge reduction may be classified as "Rollover
Purchases." An exchange or rollover is generally treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes. See "Taxes" in Part B of the prospectus.


Rollover Purchases are also subject to the C&D Fee. See "Expenses of the
Trust" in Part B of the prospectus.


Employees. We do not charge the portion of the transactional sales fee
that we would normally pay to your financial professional for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees and their family members (spouses, children
under the age of 21 living in the same household and parents) of Guggenheim
Funds and its affiliates, or by employees of selling firms and their family
members (spouses, children under the age of 21 living in the same household and
parents). You pay only the portion of the fee that the sponsor retains. Such
purchases are also subject to the C&D Fee. This discount applies during the
initial offering period and in the secondary market. Only those broker-dealers
that allow their employees to participate in employee discount programs will be
eligible for this discount.


Dividend Reinvestment Plan. We do not charge any transactional sales fee
when you reinvest distributions from your trust into additional units of the
trust. Since the deferred sales fee is a fixed dollar amount per unit, your
trust must charge the deferred sales fee per unit regardless of this discount.
If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan, we will credit you with
additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover the amount of any
remaining deferred sales fee that will be collected on such units at the time of
reinvestment. The dollar value of these units will fluctuate over time. This
discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.


See "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the
prospectus for more information regarding buying units.


How We Distribute Units. We sell units to the public through
broker-dealers and other firms. We pay part of the sales fee you pay to these
distribution firms when they sell units. The distribution fee paid for a given
transaction is as follows:








                        Concession
                       per Unit (as a
Purchase Amount/      % of the Public
Form of Purchase      Offering Price)
-------------------------------------
Less than $50,000           2.25%
$50,000 - $99,999           2.00
$100,000 - $249,999         1.75
$250,000 - $499,999         1.50
$500,000 - $999,999         1.25
$1,000,000 or more          0.75
Rollover Purchases          1.30
Fee Account and
   Employee Purchases       0.00








We apply these amounts as a percent of the unit price per transaction at
the time of the transaction.


Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain Guggenheim Funds
unit trusts are eligible to receive additional compensation for volume sales.
Such payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to dealer
firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus. The additional
payments will be as follows:








Primary Offering             Additional
Period Sales During            Volume
Calendar Quarter             Concession
---------------------------------------
$0 but less than $10 million    0.000%
$10 million but
  less than $25 million         0.075
$25 million but
  less than $50 million         0.100
$50 million or more             0.125








Eligible unit trusts include all Guggenheim Funds unit trusts sold in the
primary market. Redemptions of units during the primary offering period will
reduce the amount of units used to calculate the volume concessions. In
addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units
which are not subject to a transactional sales fee. However, such sales will be
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for
volume concessions.


Guggenheim Funds reserves the right to modify or terminate the volume
concession program at any time. The sponsor may also pay to certain dealers an
administrative fee for information or service used in connection with the
distribution of trust units. Such amounts will be in addition to any
concessions received for the sale of units.


In addition to the concessions described above, the sponsor may pay
additional compensation out of its own assets to broker-dealers that meet
certain sales targets and that have agreed to provide services relating to the
trust to their customers.


Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker-Dealers. The sponsor, at its own
expense and out of its own profits, may provide additional compensation and
benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of your trust and other
Guggenheim Funds products. This compensation is intended to result in additional
sales of Guggenheim Funds products and/or compensate broker-dealers and
financial advisors for past sales. A number of factors are considered in
determining whether to pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include,
but are not limited to, the level or type of services provided by the
intermediary, the level or expected level of sales of Guggenheim Funds products
by the intermediary or its agents, the placing of Guggenheim Funds products on a
preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary's personnel,
and other factors.


The sponsor makes these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisers, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an
intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in
broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the
sponsor's products. The sponsor may make such payments to many intermediaries
that sell Guggenheim Funds products. The sponsor may also make certain payments
to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred
for the purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing
trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.


Payments of such additional compensation, some of which may be
characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an incentive for financial
intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend a Guggenheim Funds
product, including your trust, over products offered by other sponsors or fund
companies. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your
units.


We generally register units for sale in various states in the United
States. We do not register units for sale in any foreign country. It is your
financial professional's responsibility to make sure that units are registered
or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy
units in another country. This prospectus does not constitute an offer of units
in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully. We may
reject any order for units in whole or in part.


We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices. The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them. We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units. For example, we lost the amount set forth in your trust's "Trust
Portfolio" on the initial deposit of securities in your trust.


See "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the
prospectus for additional information.



How to Sell Your Units



You can sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial
professional or, in some cases, the trustee. Unit prices are available daily on
the Internet at www.guggenheiminvestments.com or through your financial
professional. We often refer to the sale price of units as the "liquidation
price." You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem your
units. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit
redemptions or sale requests.


Until the end of the initial offering period or six months after the
Inception Date, at the discretion of the sponsor, the price at which the trustee
will redeem units and the price at which the sponsor may repurchase units
include estimated organization costs. After such period, the amount paid will
not include such estimated organization costs. If units of the trust are
redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period, the entire deferred sales fee
will be collected.


Selling Units. We do not intend to but may maintain a secondary market for
units. This means that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the
current price which is based on their net asset value. We may then resell the
units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the
redemption price. Our secondary market repurchase price is generally the same
as the redemption price. Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a secondary
market in units. You should contact your financial professional for current
unit prices to determine the best price available. We may discontinue our
secondary market at any time without notice. Even if we do not make a market,
you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for
the current price.


Redeeming Units. You may also be able to redeem your units directly with
the trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange
is open. The trustee must receive your completed redemption request prior to the
close of the New York Stock Exchange for you to receive the unit price for a
particular day. (For what constitutes a completed redemption request, see
"Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units--Redemption" in Part B of the
prospectus.) If your request is received after that time or is incomplete in any
way, you will receive the next price computed after the trustee receives your
completed request. Rather than contacting the trustee directly, your financial
professional may also be able to redeem your units by using the Investors
Voluntary Redemptions and Sales (IVORS) automated redemption service offered
through Depository Trust Company.


If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment
for your units no later than three business days after it receives all
necessary documentation. At the sponsor's discretion, certain redemptions may
be made by an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units in
lieu of cash.


You can generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities
underlying your units if you own units worth at least $25,000 or you originally
paid at least that amount for your units. This option is generally available
only for securities traded and held in the United States and is not available
within 30 business days of the trust's termination. We may modify or
discontinue this option at any time without notice. If you request an in-kind
distribution of the securities underlying units of the trust, you will incur
any distribution or service fees (Rule 12b-1 fees) applicable to those
securities.


Exchange Option. You may be able to exchange your units for units of other
Guggenheim Funds unit trusts at a reduced sales fee. You can contact your
financial professional or Guggenheim Funds for more information about trusts
currently available for exchanges. Before you exchange units, you should read
the prospectus carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then
discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your
investment goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss
tax consequences. To qualify for a reduced sales fee, you may need to meet
certain criteria. We may discontinue this option at any time.


For more complete information regarding selling or redeeming your units,
see "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the prospectus.



Distributions



Dividends. Your trust generally pays dividends from its net investment
income, if any, along with any excess capital on each distribution date to
unitholders of record on the preceding record date. You can elect to:


o    reinvest distributions in additional units of your trust at no fee, or


o    receive distributions in cash.


You may change your election by contacting your financial professional or
the trustee. Once you elect to participate in a reinvestment program, the
trustee will automatically reinvest your distributions into additional units at
their net asset value three business days prior to the distribution date. We
waive the sales fee for reinvestments into units of your trust. We cannot
guarantee that units will always be available for reinvestment. If units are
unavailable, you will receive cash distributions. We may discontinue these
options at any time without notice.


Distributions will be made from the Income and Capital Accounts on the
distribution date provided the aggregate amount available for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the net asset value of your trust. Undistributed money
in the Income and Capital Accounts will be distributed in the next month in
which the aggregate amount available for distribution equals or exceeds 0.1% of
the net asset value of your trust.


In some cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an
excessive amount of principal pending distribution. For example, this could
happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose
security is in your portfolio. The amount of your distributions will vary from
time to time as companies change their dividends, trust expenses change or as a
result of changes in your trust's portfolio.


Reinvest in Your Trust. You can keep your money working by electing to
reinvest your distributions in additional units of your trust. The easiest way
to do this is to have your financial professional purchase units with one of
the Reinvestment CUSIP numbers listed in the "Investment Summary" section of
this prospectus. You may also make or change your election by contacting your
financial professional or the trustee. This reinvestment option may be subject
to availability or limitation by the broker-dealer or selling firm. In certain
circumstances, broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a
reinvestment option at any time.


Reports. The trustee will send your financial professional a statement
showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution. Each
year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust's activity
and certain tax information. You can request copies of security evaluations to
enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your
trust, if available.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.



Investment Risks



All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that
can impact the value of the securities in your trust. You should understand
these risks before you invest. You could lose some or all of your investment in
your trust. Recently, equity markets have experienced significant volatility. If
the value of the Closed-End Funds in your trust falls, the value of your units
will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective
or that your investment return will be positive over any period.


Market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security in your
trust, the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value. Market
value may be affected by a variety of factors including:


o    General securities markets movements;


o    Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector;


o    Changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector;


o    Interest rates and inflation;


o    Governmental policies and litigation; and


o    Purchases and sales of securities by the trust.


Even though we carefully supervise your portfolio, you should remember
that we do not manage your portfolio. Your trust will not sell a security
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.


Current economic conditions risk. The U.S. economy's recession began in
December 2007. This recession began with problems in the housing and credit
markets, many of which were caused by defaults on "subprime" mortgages and
mortgage-backed securities, eventually leading to the failures of some large
financial institutions. Economic activity declined across all sectors of the
economy, and the United States experienced increased unemployment. The economic
crisis affected the global economy with European and Asian markets also
suffering historic losses. In addition, Standard & Poor's Rating Services
lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States to "AA+" from
"AAA." Effects of the economic crisis can still be felt in many countries around
the world and may have an impact on the securities held by the trust.


Closed-End Fund risk. The trust invests in Closed-End Funds. Closed-End
Funds are subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet the
Closed-End Fund's investment objective and to manage the Closed-End Fund's
portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions
regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying investments change.


Shares of Closed-End Funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of Closed-End Fund shares may decrease. The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.


Certain Closed-End Funds included in the may employ the use of leverage in
their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock. While leverage often
serves to increase the yield of a Closed-End Fund, this leverage also subjects
the Closed-End Fund to increased risks, including the likelihood of increased
volatility and the possibility that the Closed-End Fund's common share income
will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on
any borrowings rises. Instability in the auction rate preferred shares market
may affect the volatility of Closed-End Funds that use such instruments to
provide leverage. In addition, Closed-End Funds are subject to their own annual
fees and expenses, including a management fee. Such fees reduce the potential
benefits associated with owning a Closed-End Fund and are in addition to your
trust's expenses.


Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of
securities held by a Closed-End Fund in your trust will decline in value
because of a rise in interest rates. Generally, securities that pay fixed rates
of return will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in
value when interest rates rise. Typically, securities that pay fixed rates of
return with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate
changes.


Credit and dividend payment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer
of a security or a Closed-End Fund is unable or unwilling to make dividend
and/or principal payments. High-yield or "junk" securities that are rated below
investment-grade are generally more susceptible to this risk than
investment-grade securities.


Call risk. Call risk is the risk that securities held by a Closed-End Fund
in your trust can be prepaid or "called" by the issuer before their stated
maturity. If securities are called, your income will decline and you may not be
able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. Also, an early call
at par of a security trading at a premium will reduce your return. Securities
held by your trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline.
This would result in early returns of principal to the Closed-End Funds in your
trust. The securities may also be subject to special or extraordinary call
provisions and "mandatory put" features that may cause the securities to be
removed from a fund prior to maturity or stated call dates. High-yield or
"junk" securities that are rated below investment-grade are generally more
susceptible to this risk than investment-grade securities.


Security quality risk. Security quality risk is the risk that a reduction
in a security's rating may decrease its value, the value of a Closed-End Fund
and the value of your investment in your trust. Securities ratings may be
reduced at any time, including during the primary offering period of your trust.


High-yield securities risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust
invest in high-yield securities. High-yield, high risk securities are subject
to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher
investment ratings. The value of these securities will decline significantly
with increases in interest rates, not only because an increase in rates
generally decreases values, but also because increased rates may indicate an
economic slowdown. An economic slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness, may affect an issuer's ability to make dividend payments.


High-yield or "junk" securities, the general names for securities rated
below investment-grade, are frequently issued by corporations in the growth
stage of their development or by established companies who are highly leveraged
or whose operations or industries are depressed. Obligations rated below
investment-grade should be considered speculative as these ratings indicate a
quality of less than investment-grade. Because high-yield securities are
generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier
than higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher
rated securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a
greater degree.


The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that
for investment-grade securities. High-yield securities are generally not listed
on a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due
to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield securities, the bid-offer
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment-grade
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to
complete.


Split-ratings risk. Split-rated securities are those securities that, at
the time of investment, are rated below investment-grade by one rating agency,
so long as at least one other rating agency rates such securities within the
four highest grades (i.e., investment-grade quality). This means that a
split-rated security may be regarded by one rating agency as having
predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity
to pay interest and repay principal, and accordingly subject to a greater risk
of default. The prices of split-rated securities, in the view of one but not
all rating agencies, may be more sensitive than securities without a
split-rating to negative developments, such as a decline in the issuer's
revenues or a general economic downturn.


Foreign securities risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest
in foreign securities. Securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those
of domestic securities. The prices of foreign securities can be more volatile
than U.S. securities due to such factors as political, social and economic
developments abroad, the differences between the regulations to which U.S. and
foreign issuers and markets are subject, the seizure by the government of
company assets, excessive taxation, withholding taxes on dividends and
interest, limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets, and political
or social instability. Other risks include the following:


o    Enforcing legal rights may be difficult, costly and slow in foreign
countries, and there may be special problems enforcing claims against
foreign governments.


o    Foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or
governmental supervision comparable to U.S. issuers, and there may be
less public information about their operations.


o    Foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S.
markets.


o    Foreign securities often trade in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect a Closed-End
Fund's net asset value, the value of dividends and interest earned,
and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities. An increase
in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies
may cause the value of a Closed-End Fund to decline. Certain foreign
currencies may be particularly volatile, and foreign governments may
intervene in the currency markets, causing a decline in value or
liquidity in a Closed-End Fund's foreign security holdings.


o    Future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely
affect the payment or receipt of income on the foreign securities.


Emerging market risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in
securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries
considered to be emerging markets. Risks of investing in developing or emerging
countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations,
liquidity concerns, delays and disruptions in settlement transactions, political
uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance.
In addition, emerging market countries may be subject to overburdened
infrastructures, obsolete financial systems and environmental problems. For
these reasons, investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative.


Convertible securities risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust
invest in convertible securities. Convertible securities generally offer lower
interest or dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-income securities of
similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation. The
market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates
increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. However, a
convertible security's market value also tends to reflect the market price of
the common stock of the issuing company, particularly when that stock price is
greater than the convertible security's "conversion price." The conversion
price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the
convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common
stock. As the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the
conversion price, the price of the convertible security tends to be
increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security. Thus, it
may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock. In
the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible
securities would be paid before that company's common stockholders.
Consequently, an issuer's convertible securities generally entail less risk
than its common stock. However, convertible securities fall below debt
obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event
of a liquidation and are typically un-rated or rated lower than such debt
obligations.


Mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of
convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion
price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common
stock, which may be significantly less than par or the price (above or below
par) paid. For these reasons, the risks associated with investing in mandatory
convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common
stocks. Mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield
to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss
upon conversion. Because the market price of a mandatory convertible security
increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock, as
the convertible security approaches its conversion date, there can be no
assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for a potential loss.


Preferred securities risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust
invest in preferred securities, such as preferred stock and trust preferred
securities.


Similar to bonds, preferred stocks typically offer a fixed rate of return
paid in the form of a dividend. Like common stock, most preferred stocks are
equity securities representing ownership in a company. Preferred stocks are
generally considered "senior securities" and preferred stockholders enjoy
preference over common stockholders with regard to dividends and liquidations.
For the prospect of a higher yield, preferred stockholders may forfeit or at
least be limited in their voting rights. Preferred stocks are generally traded
on major stock exchanges. Preferred securities are typically subordinated to
bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, in terms of
priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit
risk than those debt instruments.


Trust preferred securities are limited-life securities typically issued by
corporations, generally in the form of interest-bearing notes or preferred
securities, or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in
the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the
corporation, or similarly structured securities. Dividend payments of the trust
preferred securities generally coincide with interest payments on the underlying
obligations. Trust preferred securities and the underlying subordinated
debentures typically rank senior to the company's common and preferred stock and
junior to the company's senior debt, subordinated debt and other indebtedness.


In addition to the risks set forth above, these securities are also
subject to the following risks:


o    Trust preferred securities are designed to create the same business
risk for an investor as if the investor had bought the securities
underlying the trust preferred securities. A corporation's ability to
pay distributions on the trust preferred securities is generally
dependent on whether the corporation issuing the securities is able to
pay interest on the underlying securities.


o    Unitholders have no right to accelerate the trust preferred securities
or the underlying securities for non-payment.


o    A corporation issuing the underlying securities may elect to defer
interest payments on those securities at any time during the life of
the trust preferred securities for up to 20 consecutive quarters. If
such an election is made, distributions on the trust preferred
securities will not be made during the deferral period. During any
deferral period investors may be taxed as if the trust had received
current income. In such a case, unitholders will have income taxes
due, but will not have received income distributions to pay the taxes.


o    Tax or regulatory changes may change the tax characterization of the
preferred securities or the underlying securities, and, as a result,
may effect the value of your units.


o    Preferred securities may be subject to redemption after a certain call
date or as a result of certain tax or regulatory events. This may
occur prior to maturity.


Options risk. The value of an option held by certain Closed-End Funds in
the trust may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less
liquid or smaller, and will be affected by changes in the value and dividend
rates of the stock subject to the option, an increase in interest rates, a
change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common
stock, and the remaining time to expiration. Additionally, the value of an
option does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying stock
(although they generally move in the same direction). However, as an option
approaches its expiration date, its value increasingly moves with the price of
the stock subject to an option. The strike price for an option may be adjusted
downward before an option expiration triggered by certain corporate events
affecting that stock. A downward adjustment to the strike price will have the
effect of reducing the equity appreciation. Option strike prices may be adjusted
to reflect certain corporate events such as extraordinary dividends, stock
splits, merger or other extraordinary distributions or events. If the value of
the underlying stock exceeds the strike price of an option, it is likely that
the holder of that option will exercise their right to purchase the stock.


The call writing portion of the investment strategy of a Closed-End Fund
may not be successful in that the Closed-End Fund may not realize the full
appreciation of stocks on which such Closed-End Fund has written call options.
Many of the Closed-End Funds held in your trust will invest using a covered call
option strategy or similar income-oriented investment strategies. You should
understand the risks of these strategies before you invest. In employing a
covered call strategy, a Closed-End Fund will generally write (sell) call
options on a significant portion of the Closed-End Fund's managed assets. These
call options will give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to
purchase a security from the Closed-End Fund at the strike price on or prior to
the option's expiration date. The ability to successfully implement the
Closed-End Fund's investment strategy depends on the Closed-End Fund adviser's
ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured. Thus,
the use of options may require a Closed-End Fund to sell portfolio securities at
inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the
amount of appreciation the Closed-End Fund can realize on an investment, or may
cause the Closed-End Fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. The
writer (seller) of an option has no control over the time when it may be
required to fulfill its obligation as a writer (seller) of the option. Once an
option writer (seller) has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a
closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the
option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price. As the
writer (seller) of a covered call option, a Closed-End Fund forgoes, during the
option's life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of
the security underlying the call option above the sum of the premium and the
strike price of the call option, but has retained the risk of loss should the
price of the underlying security decline. The value of the options written

(sold) by a Closed-End Fund, which will be marked-to-market on a daily basis,
will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the underlying
securities, an increase in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived
volatility of securities markets and the underlying securities and the remaining
time to the options' expiration.


An option is generally considered "covered" if the Closed-End Fund owns
the security underlying the call option or has an absolute and immediate right
to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or, if
required, cash or other liquid assets are segregated by the fund) upon
conversion or exchange of other securities held by the Closed-End Fund. In
certain cases, a call option may also be considered covered if a Closed-End
Fund holds a call option on the same security as the call option written (sold)
provided that certain conditions are met. By writing (selling) covered call
options, a Closed-End Fund generally seeks to generate income, in the form of
the premiums received for writing (selling) the call options. Investment income
paid by a Closed-End Fund to its shareholders (such as the trust) may be
derived primarily from the premiums it receives from writing (selling) call
options and, to a lesser extent, from the dividends and interest it receives
from the equity securities or other investments held in the Closed-End Fund's
portfolio and short-term gains thereon. Premiums from writing (selling) call
options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in a
Closed-End Fund's portfolio can vary widely over time.


REIT risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest primarily
in REITs and other real estate securities. REITs may concentrate their
investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, such as
hotels, shopping malls, residential complexes and office buildings. The value of
the REIT and the ability of the REIT to distribute income may be adversely
affected by several factors, including: rising interest rates; changes in the
national, state and local economic climate and real estate conditions;
perceptions of prospective tenants about the safety, convenience and
attractiveness of the properties; the ability of the owner to provide adequate
management, maintenance and insurance; increased competition from new
properties; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and
compliance with environmental laws; changes in real estate taxes and other
operating expenses; adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies;
adverse changes in zoning laws; declines in the value of real estate; and other
factors beyond the control of the issuer of the REIT.


The value of a REIT may also be affected by the downturn in the subprime
mortgage lending market in the United States. Subprime loans have higher
defaults and losses than prime loans. Subprime loans also have higher serious
delinquency rates than prime loans. The downturn in the subprime mortgage
lending market may have far-reaching consequences into many aspects and
geographic regions of the real estate business, and consequently, the value of
the portfolio may decline in response to such developments.


Limited liquidity and volatility risk. The markets for fixed-income
securities, such as those held by certain Closed-End Funds held by your trust,
may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility. General market uncertainty
and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and
buyers, which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a
variety of fixed-income securities. These conditions resulted, and in many cases
continue to result in, greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit
spreads and a lack of price transparency, with many debt securities remaining
illiquid and of uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of
some of the securities held by a Closed-End Fund uncertain and/or result in
sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings. In
addition, illiquidity and volatility in the credit markets may directly and
adversely affect the setting of dividend rates on the shares of the Closed-End
Funds.


Senior loan risk. Certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may invest in
senior loans. Senior loans in which the Closed-End Funds invest:


o    generally are of below investment-grade credit quality;


o    may be unrated at the time of investment;


o    generally are not registered with the SEC or any state securities
commission; and


o    generally are not listed on any securities exchange.


The amount of public information available on senior loans generally will
be less extensive than that available for other types of assets.


No reliable, active trading market currently exists for many senior loans,
although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past
several years. Senior loans are thus relatively illiquid. Liquidity relates to
the ability of a Closed-End Fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a
price approximately equal to its value on the Closed-End Fund's books. The
illiquidity of senior loans may impair a Closed-End Fund's ability to realize
the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary
liquidation of such assets. Because of the lack of an active trading market,
illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external
pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities. However, many
senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of
financial institutions. To the extent that a secondary market does exist for
certain senior loans, the market may be subject to irregular trading activity,
wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods. The market for
senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a
substantial increase or decrease in interest rates. This could result in
increased volatility in the market and in your trust's net asset value.


If legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional
requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions, the availability of
senior loans for investment by the Closed-End Funds may be adversely affected.
In addition, such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate
sources of financing for certain borrowers. This would increase the risk of
default. If legislation or federal or state regulators require financial
institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged
transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny,
financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans. Such sales
could result in depressed prices. If a Closed-End Fund attempts to sell a
senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale,
the price a Closed-End Fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely
affected.


Some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the senior loans
to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other
action detrimental to lenders. Such court action could under certain
circumstances include invalidation of senior loans. Any lender, which could
include a Closed-End Fund, is subject to the risk that a court could find the
lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws
of tort or contracts or anti-fraud provisions of certain securities laws for
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of
a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral
underlying the senior loan.


Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization company risk. Certain
Closed-End Funds held by the trust may include securities issued by
small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. These securities
customarily involve more investment risk than large-capitalization companies.
These additional risks are due in part to the following factors.
Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may:


o    Have limited product lines, markets or financial resources;


o    Be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new
and/or emerging technologies. These technologies may be slow to
develop or fail to develop altogether;


o    Have less publicly available information;


o    Lack management depth or experience;


o    Be less liquid;


o    Be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments;
and


o    Be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key
personnel.


o    Be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments;
and


o    Be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key
personnel.


Litigation and legislation risk. Your trust is also subject to litigation
and legislation risk. From time to time, various legislative initiatives are
proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain issuers represented in your trust. In addition, litigation regarding
any of the issuers of the securities or of the sectors represented by these
issuers, may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the
share prices of these securities. We cannot predict what impact any pending or
threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the share prices
of the securities.


Inflation risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or
income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the
value of money.


Significant unitholders risk. There may be unitholders of the trust who
hold a significant portion of the trust and, as result, a redemption by such
significant holder may have a material impact on the size, expenses and
viability of the trust.


See "Risk Factors" in Part B of the prospectus for additional information.



How the Trust Works



Your Trust. Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. We created your
trust under a trust agreement between Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC (as
sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).
To create your trust, we deposited contracts to purchase securities with the
trustee along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay
for the securities. In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to
us. Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.
These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.


Changing Your Portfolio. Your trust is not a managed fund. Unlike a
managed fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed after its
inception. Your trust will generally buy and sell securities:


o    to pay expenses,


o    to issue additional units or redeem units,


o    in limited circumstances to protect a trust,


o    to avoid direct or indirect ownership of a passive foreign investment
company,


o    to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the
trust, or


o    as permitted by the trust agreement.


You will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in your
trust. As the holder of the securities, the trustee will vote the securities and
will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as
closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are
the securities held by owners other than your trust. However, the trustee may
not be able to vote the securities in your trust that are traded on foreign
exchanges.


Your trust will generally reject any offer for securities or property
other than cash in exchange for the securities in its portfolio. However, if a
public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has
been announced affecting a security, your trust may either sell the security or
accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or
tender is in the best interest of unitholders. The trustee will distribute any
cash proceeds to unitholders. If your trust receives securities or property
other than cash, it may either hold the securities or property in its portfolio
or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds. For example,
this could happen in a merger or similar transaction.


Only the trustee may vote the shares of the Closed-End Funds held in your
trust. The trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as the
shares held by other shareholders of each Closed-End Fund.


We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units. When we create
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio. In certain
cases, the trustee may need additional time to acquire the securities necessary
to create units and consequently, the trust may not be fully invested at all
times, which may impact the trust's performance. When your trust buys
securities, it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees. You could
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities. When your trust buys or sells securities, we may direct that it
place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or
are affiliated with your trust. We will not select firms to handle these
transactions on the basis of their sale of units of a trust. We cannot guarantee
that the trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of
time.


Termination of Your Trust. Your trust will terminate no later than the
termination date listed in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus.
The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less
than $1 million or less than 40% of the value of the securities in the trust at
the end of the initial offering period. At this size, the expenses of your
trust may create an undue burden on your investment. Investors owning
two-thirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust
early. We may also terminate your trust in other limited circumstances.


The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining
securities. The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting
final expenses. Your termination distribution may be less than the price you
originally paid for your units.

additional information.



General Information



Guggenheim Funds. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC specializes in the
creation, development and distribution of investment solutions for advisors and
their valued clients. In November 2001, we changed our name from Ranson &
Associates, Inc. to Claymore Securities, Inc. ("Claymore"). On September 27,
2010, Claymore officially changed its name to Guggenheim Funds Distributors,

LLC. This change follows the acquisition of Claymore by Guggenheim Partners, LLC
on October 14, 2009. Since the finalization of the acquisition, we have been
operating as a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC.


During our history we have been active in public and corporate finance,
have underwritten closed-end funds and have distributed bonds, mutual funds,
closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, structured products and unit trusts in
the primary and secondary markets. We are a registered broker-dealer and member
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). If we fail to or cannot
perform our duties as sponsor or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us,
continue to operate your trust without a sponsor, or terminate your trust. You
can contact us at our headquarters at 2455 Corporate West Drive, Lisle,
Illinois 60532 or by using the contacts listed on the back cover of this
prospectus. Guggenheim Funds personnel may from time to time maintain a
position in certain securities held by your trust.


Guggenheim Funds and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Guggenheim Funds' employees who have access to information on trust
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the
code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your trust.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.


The Trustee. The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust. It
is a trust company organized under New York law. You can contact the trustee by
calling the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or write to
Unit Investment Trust Division, 2 Hanson Place, 12th Fl., Brooklyn, New York
11217. We may remove and replace the trustee in some cases without your consent.
The trustee may also resign by notifying the sponsor and investors.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.



Expenses



Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations. The
"Investment Summary" section of this prospectus shows the estimated amount of
these expenses.


Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services. The trustee
also benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing
accounts. Your trust will reimburse the sponsor as supervisor and evaluator for
providing portfolio supervisory services, evaluating your portfolio and
performing bookkeeping and administrative services. Our reimbursements may
exceed the costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed
the costs of services provided to all Guggenheim Funds unit investment trusts
in any calendar year. In addition, the trustee may reimburse the sponsor out of
its own assets for services performed by employees of the sponsor in connection
with the operation of your trust. All of these fees may adjust for inflation
without your approval.


Your trust will pay a fee to the sponsor for creating and developing the
trust, including determining the trust objective, policies, composition and
size, selecting service providers and information services, and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. Your trust pays this
"creation and development fee" of $0.05 per unit from the assets of the trust
as of the close of the initial public offering period. The sponsor does not use
the fee to pay distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.


Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses, including any
licensing fees. Your trust may pay expenses such as trustee expenses (including
legal and auditing expenses), organization expenses, various governmental
charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of taking action to
protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and Guggenheim Funds,
legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs incurred
to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions. Your trust
may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year. The trustee
may sell securities to pay trust expenses.


The trust, and therefore the unitholders of the trust, will also
indirectly bear the expenses of the underlying Closed-End Funds. While the
trust will not pay these expenses directly out of its assets, these expenses
are shown under "Annual Fund Operating Expenses of the Trust" in the "Fees and
Expenses" section of the prospectus to illustrate the impact of these expenses.
Please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service
provider to certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust and therefore certain
fees paid by the trust to such Closed-End Funds will be paid to the sponsor or
an affiliate for its services to such Closed-End Funds.


See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.

Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092



We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition,
including the trust portfolio set forth on pages 10 and 11 of this prospectus,
of Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092, as of October 7, 2013, the
initial date of deposit. This statement of financial condition is the
responsibility of the trust's sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.
The trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown
in the statement of financial condition as of October 7, 2013. We believe that
our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above
presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Guggenheim
Defined Portfolios, Series 1092, as of October 7, 2013, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price
evaluations as determined by the trustee.


(2)  A letter of credit has been deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon,
trustee, covering the funds (aggregating $150,407) necessary for the
purchase of the securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.


(3)  A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to
pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing your trust.
These costs have been estimated at $8.00 per 100 units of the trust. A
distribution will be made as of the close of the initial offering period or
six months after the initial date of deposit (at the discretion of the
sponsor) to an account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation
of the investors will be satisfied. Organization costs will not be assessed
to units that are redeemed prior to the close of the initial offering
period or six months after the initial date of deposit (at the discretion
of the sponsor). To the extent that actual organization costs are greater
than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to
the Public Offering Price will be deducted from the assets of the trust.


(4)  The aggregate cost to unitholders includes a maximum sales fee, which
consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee and a creation and
development fee. The initial sales fee is equal to the difference between
the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and
the creation and development fee. On the Inception Date, the maximum sales
fee is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 2.98% of the net
amount invested). The deferred sales fee is equal to $0.145 per unit.


(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable transactional sales
fee assuming no reduction of transactional sales fees for quantity
purchases.


(6)  The trust is committed to pay a creation and development fee of $5.00 per
100 units at the close of the initial public offering period. The creation
and development fee will not be assessed to units that are redeemed prior
to the close of the initial offering period.

General Information



Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Guggenheim Defined Portfolios and registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. Each trust was
created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus
under the laws of the state of New York. Each trust was created under a trust
agreement among Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC (as sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).


When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of
units of the trust. After your trust is created, the sponsor may deposit
additional securities in the trust, contracts to purchase additional securities
along with cash (or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash) to pay for such
contracted securities or cash (including a letter of credit) with instructions
to purchase additional securities. Such additional deposits will be in amounts
which will seek to replicate, as closely as practicable, the portfolio
immediately prior to such deposits. If the sponsor deposits cash, existing and
new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the
securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the
securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees.


A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Trust Portfolio" in
the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b)
any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the
provisions of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the
trust. Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any
failure in any of the securities. However, should any contract for the purchase
of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will,
unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase
are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,
refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all
unitholders on the next distribution date.



Investment Policies



The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed"
fund. Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic,
financial and market analysis. The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer
will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.


Unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities
in a trust. As the holder of the securities, the trustee will vote the
securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities
are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general
proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust. However,
the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded
on foreign exchanges.


The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may (but need not) direct
the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer
having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations, the
issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code or the price of a security has declined to such an extent
or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the sponsor the
retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust. If a public
tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or
accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or
tender is in the best interest of unitholders. The trustee will distribute any
cash proceeds to unitholders. Pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited
exceptions, the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in
exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or
other transaction. If offered such new or exchanged securities or property
other than cash, the trustee shall reject the offer. However, in the event such
securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust, they may be
accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a
trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor. Proceeds from the sale of
securities (or any securities or other property received by the trust in
exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital Account for distribution
to unitholders or to meet redemptions.


Except as stated in the trust agreement, or in the prospectus, the
acquisition by the trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities
is prohibited. The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from
the trust for the purpose of redeeming units of a trust tendered for redemption
and the payment of expenses and for such other purposes as permitted under the
trust agreement.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the trustee is authorized to reinvest any
funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts, pending distribution, in U.S.
Treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution
date. Any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds
therefrom may not be reinvested.


Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.
Except for failed securities and as provided in the prospectus or in the trust
agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the
portfolio securities is prohibited. The trustee may sell securities from a
trust for limited purposes, including redeeming units tendered for redemption
and the payment of expenses.



Risk Factors



Stocks. An investment in units of a trust should be made with an
understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities,
including the risk that the financial condition of issuers of the securities
may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may
worsen (both of which may contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the
securities and thus, in the value of the units) or the risk that holders of
common stock have a right to receive payments from the issuers of those stocks
that is generally inferior to that of creditors of, or holders of debt
obligations issued by, the issuers and that the rights of holders of common
stock generally rank inferior to the rights of holders of preferred stock. You
could lose some or all of your investment in the trust. Common stocks are
especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile
increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of the
issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or
regional political, economic or banking crises.


Holders of common stock incur more risk than the holders of preferred
stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the
entity, have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in
comparison with the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or
preferred stock issued by the issuer. Holders of common stock of the type held
by a trust have a right to receive dividends only when and if, and in the
amounts, declared by the issuer's board of directors and to participate in
amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on
the issuer have been paid or provided for. By contrast, holders of preferred
stock have the right to receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared
by the issuer's board of directors, normally on a cumulative basis, but do not
participate in other amounts available for distribution by the issuing
corporation. Cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common
stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to
future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock.
Preferred stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to
those of common stocks. Moreover, common stocks do not represent an obligation
of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the
degree of protection of capital debt securities. Indeed, the issuance of debt
securities or even preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of
principal, interest, liquidation preferences and dividends which could
adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay
dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with
respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. Further, unlike
debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at
maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market fluctuations prior
thereto), common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity
and have values which are subject to market fluctuations for as long as the
stocks remain outstanding. The value of the securities in a portfolio thus may
be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of a trust to values higher or
lower than those prevailing at the time of purchase.


The sponsor's buying and selling of the securities, especially during the
initial offering of units of the trust or to satisfy redemptions of units may
impact upon the value of the underlying securities and the units. The
publication of the list of the securities selected for the trust may also cause
increased buying activity in certain of the stocks comprising the portfolio.
After such announcement, investment advisory and brokerage clients of the
sponsor and its affiliates may purchase individual securities appearing on the
list during the course of the initial offering period or may purchase warrants
issued by the sponsor or its affiliates which are based on the performance of
the securities on the list. The sponsor or its affiliates may also purchase
securities as a hedge against its risk on the warrants (although generally the
sponsor and its affiliates will not purchase securities for their own account
until after the trust portfolio has been acquired). Such buying activity in the
stock of these companies or issuance of the warrants prior to the purchase of
the securities by the trust may cause the trust to purchase stocks at a higher
price than those buyers who effect purchases by the trust.


Fixed Portfolio. Investors should be aware that the trust is not "managed"
and as a result, the adverse financial condition of a company will not result
in the elimination of its securities from the portfolio of the trust except
under extraordinary circumstances. Investors should note in particular that the
securities were selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in the
prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities
originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the
attractiveness of the securities may have changed. A number of the securities
in the trust may also be owned by other clients of the sponsor. However,
because these clients may have differing investment objectives, the sponsor may
sell certain securities from those accounts in instances where a sale by the
trust would be impermissible, such as to maximize return by taking advantage of
market fluctuations. In the event a public tender offer is made for a security
or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security, the sponsor may
instruct the trustee to tender or sell the security on the open market when, in
its opinion, it is in the best interest of the unitholders of the unit to do
so. Although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and the sponsor
may instruct the trustee to sell securities under certain limited
circumstances, securities will not be sold by the trust to take advantage of
market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation. As a
result, the amount realized upon the sale of the securities may not be the
highest price attained by an individual security during the life of the trust.
The prices of single shares of each of the securities in the trust vary widely,
and the effect of a dollar of fluctuation, either higher or lower, in stock
prices will be much greater as a percentage of the lower-price stocks' purchase
price than as a percentage of the higher-price stocks' purchase price.


Closed-End Fund Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust
may invest in the common stock of closed-end funds ("Closed-End Funds").
Closed-End Funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in
various types of securities. Closed-End Funds issue shares of common stock that
are traded on a securities exchange. Closed-End Funds are subject to various
risks, including management's ability to meet the Closed-End Fund's investment
objective, and to manage the Closed-End Fund portfolio when the underlying
securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying
investments change.


Shares of Closed-End Funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of Closed-End Fund shares may decrease. The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.


Certain of the Closed-End Funds included in a trust may employ the use of
leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock. While
leverage often serves to increase the yield of a Closed-End Fund, this leverage
also subjects the Closed-End Fund to increased risks, including the likelihood
of increased volatility and the possibility that the Closed-End Fund's common
share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the
interest rate on any borrowings rises.


Market Discounts or Premiums. Certain of the securities may have been
deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their dividend
rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities. The
current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated
securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in
market value as they approach maturity. The current returns of market premium
securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because
premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity.
Because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments
and not at maturity, an early redemption at par of a premium security will
result in a reduction in yield to the trust. Market premium or discount
attributable to dividend rate changes does not indicate market confidence or
lack of confidence in the issue.


Liquidity. Whether or not the securities are listed on a national
securities exchange, the principal trading market for the securities may be in
the over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading
market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in
the securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of
the securities, that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the
liquidity of the securities in any markets made. In addition, a trust is
restricted under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from selling securities to
the sponsor. The price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions
and the value of a trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the
securities are limited or absent.


Additional Deposits. The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit) with instructions
to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the issuance of a
corresponding number of additional units. If the sponsor deposits cash,
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of
the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the
securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees. To
minimize this effect, the trusts will attempt to purchase the securities as
close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible.


Some of the securities may have limited trading volume. The trustee, with
directions from the sponsor, will endeavor to purchase securities with
deposited cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those
securities over the 20 business days following each deposit in an effort to
reduce the effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks. This
could, however, result in the trusts' failure to participate in any
appreciation of those stocks before the cash is invested. If any cash remains
at the end of this period (and such date is within the 90-day period following
the inception date) and cannot be invested in one or more stocks, at what the
sponsor considers reasonable prices, it intends to use that cash to purchase
each of the other securities in the original proportionate relationship among
those securities. Similarly, at termination of the trust, the sponsor reserves
the right to sell securities over a period of up to nine business days to
lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the securities. The
proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will
reflect the actual sales proceeds received on the securities, which will likely
differ from the closing sale price on the termination date.


Litigation and Legislation. At any time litigation may be initiated on a
variety of grounds, or legislation may be enacted with respect to the
securities in a trust or the issuers of the securities. There can be no
assurance that future litigation or legislation will not have a material
adverse effect on the trust or will not impair the ability of issuers to
achieve their business goals.


Financial Sector Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, certain
of the issuers of securities in a trust may be involved in the financial
sector. An investment in units of a trust containing securities of such issuers
should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the
financial sector in general.


Banks, thrifts and their holding companies are especially subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets, in commercial and residential real estate
loans or any particular segment or industry; and competition from new entrants
in their fields of business. Banks and thrifts are highly dependent on net
interest margin. Banks and thrifts traditionally receive a significant portion
of their revenues from consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in
mortgage and refinance markets. As home purchasing and refinancing activity has
subsided, this revenue has diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate
markets have deteriorated, leading to asset write-offs and decreased liquidity
in the credit markets, which can have a substantial negative effect upon banks
and thrifts because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in
loans secured by real estate. Difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit
markets have resulted in decreases in the availability of funds. Financial
performance of many banks and thrifts, especially in securities collateralized
by mortgage loans has deteriorated.


In response to recent market and economic conditions, the United States
Government, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury"),
the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") have taken a variety of extraordinary measures including
capital injections, guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of
illiquid assets from banks designed to provide fiscal stimulus, restore
confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions.
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ("EESA") gave the U.S.
Treasury $700 billion to purchase bad mortgage-related securities that caused
much of the difficulties experienced by financial institutions and the credit
markets in general. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 ("ARRA") was signed into law in February, 2009. The EESA and ARRA, along
with the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program (which provides for direct
purchases by the U.S. Treasury of equity from financial institutions), contain
provisions limiting the way banks and their holding companies are able pay
dividends, purchase their own common stock, and compensate officers.
Furthermore, participants have been subject to forward looking stress tests to
determine if they have sufficient capital to withstand certain economic
scenarios, including situations more severe than the current recession. As a
result of these stress tests, some financial institutions were required to
increase their level of capital through a combination of asset sales,
additional equity offerings and the conversion of preferred shares into common
stock. The long-term effects of the EESA, ARRA, and the stress tests are not
yet known and cannot be predicted. This uncertainty may cause increased costs
and risks for the firms associated with the respective programs.


Banks, thrifts and their holding companies are subject to extensive
federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state
regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and
limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks and
thrifts may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of
discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and
may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular
institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such
institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory
actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to
banks and thrifts and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be
paid by banks and thrifts to the FDIC, can negatively impact earnings and the
ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits
nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of
banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in
the securities issued by such institutions.


In light of the current credit market difficulties, the U.S. Government is
considering changes to the laws and regulatory structure. New legislation and
regulatory changes could cause business disruptions, result in significant loss
of revenue, limit financial firms' ability to pursue business opportunities,
impact the value of business assets and impose additional costs that may
adversely affect business. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact
these laws and their implementing regulations, or any other governmental
program, will have on the financial markets. Currently the FRB, FDIC,
Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Comptroller of the Currency (a
bureau of the U.S. Treasury which regulates national banks), and the U.S.
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (which oversees commodity futures and
option markets) all play a role in the supervision of the financial markets.
Recently passed legislation calls for swift government intervention which
includes the creation of new federal agencies that will have a direct impact on
the financial, banking and insurance industries. This new legislation includes
the creation of a Financial Oversight Council to advise the FRB on the
identification of firms who failure could pose a threat to financial stability
due to their combination of size, leverage, and interconnectedness.
Additionally, these financial firms would be subject to increased scrutiny
concerning their capital, liquidity, and risk management standards.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of
banks, thrifts and their holding companies have increased significantly and
have undergone substantial change in the recent past. To a great extent, these
changes are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and
Improvement Act of 1991, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 and the regulations promulgated under these laws. In
1999, the Gramm--Leach--Bliley Act repealed most of the barriers set up by the
1933 Glass--Steagall Act which separated the banking, insurance and securities
industries. Banks and thrifts now face significant competition from other
financial institutions such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking
companies and insurance companies. Banks, insurance companies and securities
firms can merge to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range
of financial service products to investors. This legislation has resulted in
increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new
participants in the field. Efforts to expand the ability of federal thrifts to
branch on an interstate basis have been initially successful through
promulgation of regulations and legislation to liberalize interstate banking
has been signed into law. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase or
establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been
allowed to turn existing banks into branches, thus leading to continued
consolidation.


The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") require the expanded use of market value accounting by
banks and have imposed rules requiring mark-to-market accounting for investment
securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of
additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health
of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems.
Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures" changed the requirements of mark-to-market accounting and
determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or
liability has significantly decreased. These changes and other potential
changes in financial accounting rules and valuation techniques may have a
significant impact on the banking and financial services industries in terms of
accurately pricing assets or liabilities. Additional legislative and regulatory
changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory authorities have
proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending
laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if
any, that such changes would have on the securities in a trust's portfolio. In
addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by
Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that system could,
among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be
used by banks or change the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any
depositor. On October 3, 2008, EESA increased the maximum amount of federal
deposit insurance coverage payable as to any certificate of deposit from
$100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The impact of this reform is unknown and
could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank
institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles
other than bank deposits. The sponsor makes no prediction as to what, if any,
manner of bank and thrift regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or
what ultimate effect such actions might have on a trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act") generally
prohibits a bank holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a
bank or bank holding company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank
holding company, (3) acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank,
or (4) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, without
first obtaining FRB approval. In considering an application with respect to any
such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of
banks or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies in which the FRB expressed its view that a bank holding
company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which
exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken
its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose limitations
on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain
applications, including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions.
The sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have
on the securities in a trust or whether such approvals, if necessary, will be
obtained.


Companies engaged in investment banking/brokerage and investment
management include brokerage firms, broker/dealers, investment banks, finance
companies and mutual fund companies. Earnings and share prices of companies in
this industry are quite volatile, and often exceed the volatility levels of the
market as a whole. Negative economic events in the credit markets have led some
firms to declare bankruptcy, forced short-notice sales to competing firms, or
required government intervention by the FDIC or through an infusions of
Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. Consolidation in the industry and the
volatility in the stock market have negatively impacted investors.


Additionally, government intervention has required many financial
institutions to become bank holding companies under the BHC Act. Under the
system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the FRB
supervises bank holding companies as an umbrella regulator. The BHC Act and
regulations generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business
activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related
activities. The FRB and FDIC have also issued substantial risk-based and
leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. The
guidelines define a three-tier framework, requiring depository institutions to
maintain certain leverage ratios depending on the type of assets held. If any
depository institution controlled by a financial or bank holding company ceases
to meet capital or management standards, the FRB may impose corrective capital
and/or managerial requirements on the company and place limitations on its
ability to conduct broader financial activities. Furthermore, proposed
legislation will allow the Treasury and the FDIC to create a resolution regime
to "take over" bank and financial holding companies. The "taking over" would be
based on whether the firm is in default or in danger of defaulting and whether
such a default would have a serious adverse effect on the financial system or
the economy. This mechanism would only be used by the government in exceptional
circumstances to mitigate these effects. This type of intervention has unknown
risks and costs associated with it, which may cause unforeseeable harm in the
industry.


Companies involved in the insurance industry are engaged in underwriting,
reinsuring, selling, distributing or placing of property and casualty, life or
health insurance. Other growth areas within the insurance industry include
brokerage, reciprocals, claims processors and multi-line insurance companies.
Interest rate levels, general economic conditions and price and marketing
competition affect insurance company profits. Property and casualty insurance
profits may also be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters. Life
and health insurance profits may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates.
Individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve
inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations, and profitability. In
addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies continue to shrink
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital
expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance industry are subject to significant risk factors, including those
applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as: (i) the inherent
uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability loss reserves,
particularly reserves for the cost of environmental, asbestos and mass tort
claims, and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established
loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of
operations and financial condition; (ii) the fact that insurance companies have
experienced, and can be expected in the future to experience, catastrophe
losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow; (iii) the inherent uncertainty in the
process of establishing property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss
payment patterns caused by new claims settlement practices; (iv) the need for
insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of
statutory capital and surplus, particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by
rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities, and in order
to maintain acceptable financial strength or claims-paying ability rating; (v)
the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies'
subsidiaries are subject, various regulatory initiatives that may affect
insurance companies, and regulatory and other legal actions; (vi) the adverse
impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance
company's investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its
products; (vii) the need to adjust the effective duration of the assets and
liabilities of life insurance operations in order to meet the anticipated cash
flow requirements of its policyholder obligations; and (viii) the uncertainty
involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability
of reinsurance recoverables. This enhanced oversight into the insurance
industry may pose unknown risks to the sector as a whole.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation.
The sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Environmental pollution clean-up is the subject of both federal and state
regulation. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites
subject to clean up. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation
regarding coverage issues. The Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state
statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration by "Potentially
Responsible Parties" ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds
("Environmental Clean-up Laws" or "ECLs") establish a mechanism to pay for
clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so, and to assign liability to PRPs.
The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of
factors. The extent of clean-up necessary and the assignment of liability has
not been fully established. The insurance industry is disputing many such
claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response costs are
considered damages under the policies, when and how coverage is triggered,
applicability of pollution exclusions, the potential for joint and several
liability and definition of an occurrence. Similar coverage issues exist for
clean up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been
inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. An insurer's exposure to
liability with regard to its insureds which have been, or may be, named as PRPs
is uncertain. Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, but
none have been enacted. There can be no assurance that any Superfund reform
legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a
fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of Superfund related
claims.


While current federal income tax law permits the tax-deferred accumulation
of earnings on the premiums paid by an annuity owner and holders of certain
savings-oriented life insurance products, no assurance can be given that future
tax law will continue to allow such tax deferrals. If such deferrals were not
allowed, consumer demand for the affected products would be substantially
reduced. In addition, proposals to lower the federal income tax rates through a
form of flat tax or otherwise could have, if enacted, a negative impact on the
demand for such products.


Major determinants of future earnings of companies in the financial
services sector are the direction of the stock market, investor confidence,
equity transaction volume, the level and direction of long-term and short-term
interest rates, and the outlook for emerging markets. Negative trends in any of
these earnings determinants could have a serious adverse effect on the
financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities
included in the trust will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in
the rapidly developing marketplace. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressures to compete globally.


Foreign Securities Risk. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in foreign issuers,
and therefore, an investment in such a trust involves some investment risks
that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust that invests
entirely in securities of domestic issuers. Those investment risks include
future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the
payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, exchange control policies, and the limited
liquidity and small market capitalization of such foreign countries' securities
markets. In addition, for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there may be less publicly
available information than is available from a domestic issuer. Also, foreign
issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting, auditing and
financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those
applicable to domestic issuers. However, due to the nature of the issuers of
the securities included in the trust, the sponsor believes that adequate
information will be available to allow the sponsor to provide portfolio
surveillance.


Certain of the securities in the trust may be in ADR or GDR form. ADRs,
American Depositary Receipts and GDRs, Global Depositary Receipts, represent
common stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary. American Depositary
Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts (collectively, the "Depositary
Receipts") are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of
underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. These instruments may
not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into
which they may be converted. For purposes of the discussion herein, the terms
ADR and GDR generally include American Depositary Shares and Global Depositary
Shares, respectively.


Depositary Receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored. In an unsponsored
facility, the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of
market makers and acts as agent for the Depositary Receipts holder, while the
company itself is not involved in the transaction. In a sponsored facility, the
issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative
and shareholder-related expenses. Sponsored facilities use a single depositary
and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer, the shareholder and
the depositary; unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no
contractual relationship to the company. The depositary bank that issues
Depositary Receipts generally charges a fee, based on the price of the
Depositary Receipts, upon issuance and cancellation of the Depositary Receipts.
This fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the
acquisition or surrender of the security. In addition, the depositary bank
incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash
distributions paid in local currency into U.S. dollars and such expenses are
deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders,
resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the Depositary
Receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly.
Certain tax considerations, including tax rate differentials and withholding
requirements, arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to
nationals of another and from certain practices in the Depositary Receipts
market may also exist with respect to certain Depositary Receipts. In varying
degrees, any or all of these factors may affect the value of the Depositary
Receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market.
In addition, the rights of holders of Depositary Receipts may be different than
those of holders of the underlying shares, and the market for Depositary
Receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares. Depositary
Receipts are registered securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and
may be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.


For the securities that are Depositary Receipts, currency fluctuations
will affect the United States dollar equivalent of the local currency price of
the underlying domestic share and, as a result, are likely to affect the value
of the Depositary Receipts and consequently the value of the securities. The
foreign issuers of securities that are Depositary Receipts may pay dividends in
foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars. Most foreign
currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the United States dollar for
many reasons, including supply and demand of the respective currency, the
soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as
compared to the economies of the United States and other countries. Therefore,
for any securities of issuers (whether or not they are in Depositary Receipt
form) whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies, or which pay dividends
in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies, there is a
risk that their United States dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the
United States dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies.


On January 1, 1999, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (eleven of the fifteen
member states of the European Union ("EU"), as of such date) established fixed
conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. On
such date the Euro became the official currency of these eleven countries. The
participating countries do not control their own monetary policies by directing
independent interest rates for their currencies. Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus and
Malta have also adopted the Euro as their official currency. In these member
states, the authority to direct monetary policy, including money supply and
official interest rates for the Euro, is exercised by the European Central
Bank. The conversion of the national currencies of the participating countries
to the Euro could negatively impact the market rate of the exchange between
such currencies (or the Euro) and the U.S. dollar. As of January 1, 2013, there
were 27 member states in the EU.


In addition, European corporations, and other entities with significant
markets or operations in Europe (whether or not in the participating
countries), face strategic challenges as these entities adapt to a single
transnational currency. The Euro conversion may have a material impact on
revenues, expenses or income from operations; increase competition due to the
increased price transparency of EU markets; effect issuers' currency exchange
rate risk and derivatives exposure; disrupt current contracts; cause issuers to
increase spending on information technology updates required for the
conversion; and result in potential adverse tax consequences. The sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Euro conversion will have on any of
the issuers of securities contained in a trust.


Preferred Stock Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust,
or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in preferred stock. If
this is the case, an investment in units should be made with an understanding
of the risks which an investment in preferred stocks entails, including the
risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities or the
general condition of the preferred stock market may worsen, and the value of
the preferred stocks and therefore the value of the units may decline.
Preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to
volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and
perceptions of the issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable
factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and
fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or
contraction, market liquidity, and global or regional political, economic or
banking crises. Preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional
reductions in the dividends-received deduction which would adversely affect the
after-tax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction. Such
a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general.
Holders of preferred stocks, as owners of the entity, have rights to receive
payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally
subordinate to those of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or, in
some cases, other senior preferred stocks of, such issuers. Preferred stocks do
not represent an obligation of the issuer and, therefore, do not offer any
assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do
debt securities. The issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred
stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and
senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of
the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of
holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon
liquidation or bankruptcy. The value of preferred stocks is subject to market
fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding, and thus
the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the
trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the initial date of
deposit.


Trust Preferred Securities Risks. If set forth in Part A of the
prospectus, a trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in
trust preferred securities. Holders of trust preferred securities incur risks
in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding
preferred stocks. Trust preferred securities are limited-life preferred
securities that are typically issued by corporations, generally in the form of
interest-bearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations, or by an
affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in the form of beneficial
interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation, or similarly
structured securities. The maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred
securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures. Trust
preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may
be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments
for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of
certain circumstances at any time. Trust preferred securities generally have a
yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks, but unlike preferred stocks,
distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as
interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes. Unlike most
preferred stocks, distributions received from trust preferred securities are
generally not eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Certain of the
risks unique to trust preferred securities include: (i) distributions on trust
preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures are
made; (ii) a corporation issuing the interest-bearing notes, preferred
securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these
instruments for up to 20 consecutive quarters and if such election is made,
distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the
deferral period; (iii) certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the
redemption of the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated
debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust
preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date; (iv) future
legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from
deducting its interest payments on the interest-bearing notes, preferred
securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes, making redemption of
these instruments likely; (v) a corporation may redeem the interest-bearing
notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or
in part from time to time on or after a stated call date; (vi) trust preferred
securities holders have very limited voting rights; and (vii) payment of
interest on the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated
debentures, and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities, is
dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation.


Convertible Securities Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in convertible
securities.


Convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields
than non-convertible fixed-income securities of similar credit quality because
of the potential for capital appreciation. The market values of convertible
securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to
increase as interest rates decline. However, a convertible security's market
value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing
company, particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible
security's conversion price. The conversion price is defined as the
predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be
converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock. As the market price of
the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price, the price of
the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield
of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common
stock. Thus, it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying
common stock, and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain
or loss than common stocks. However, mandatory convertible securities (as
discussed below) generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same
extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder. In the event of a
liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities would be
paid before that company's common stockholders. Consequently, an issuer's
convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock.
However, convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer
in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are
typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations. In addition,
contingent payment, convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions
based on its nonconvertible cost of debt, which generally will result in
deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities (and
accordingly, holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash
payments received).


Mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of
convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the
conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the
underlying common stock, which may be significantly less than par or the price
(above or below par) paid. For these reasons, the risks associated with
investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks
inherent in common stocks. Mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a
higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price
volatility and loss upon conversion. Because the market price of a mandatory
convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its
underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion
date, there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the
potential loss.


Senior Loan Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust, or
issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in senior loans.


Senior loans in which a Closed-End Fund may invest:


o     generally are of below investment-grade credit quality;


o     may be unrated at the time of investment;


o     generally are not registered with the SEC or any state securities
commission; and


o     generally are not listed on any securities exchange.


The amount of public information available on senior loans generally will
be less extensive than that available for other types of assets.


No reliable, active trading market currently exists for many senior loans,
although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the
past several years. Senior loans are thus relatively illiquid. Liquidity
relates to the ability of a Closed-End Fund to sell an investment in a timely
manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the Closed-End Fund's
books. The illiquidity of senior loans may impair a Closed-End Fund's ability
to realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation of such assets. Because of the lack of an active
trading market, illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices
provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the
securities. However, many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are
held by a large number of financial institutions. To the extent that a
secondary market does exist for certain senior loans, the market may be subject
to irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade
settlement periods. The market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event
of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest
rates. This could result in increased volatility in the market and in the
trusts' net asset value.


If legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional
requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions, the availability of
senior loans for investment by the Closed-End Funds may be adversely affected.
In addition, such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate
sources of financing for certain borrowers. This would increase the risk of
default. If legislation or federal or state regulators require financial
institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged
transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny,
financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans. Such sales
could result in depressed prices. If a Closed-End Fund attempts to sell a
senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale,
the price a Closed-End Fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely
affected.


Some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the senior loans
to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other
action detrimental to lenders. Such court action could under certain
circumstances include invalidation of senior loans. Any lender, which could
include a Closed-End Fund, is subject to the risk that a court could find the
lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common
laws of tort or contracts or anti-fraud provisions of certain securities laws
for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant
terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the
collateral underlying the senior loan.


Small-Capitalization and Mid-Capitalization Stocks Risk. If set forth in
Part A of the prospectus, a trust may invest in small-capitalization or
mid-capitalization stocks. Investing in small-capitalization stocks or
mid-capitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in
large-capitalization stocks, since they can be subject to more abrupt or
erratic price movements. Many small market capitalization companies ("Small-Cap
Companies") or middle market capitalization companies ("Mid-Cap Companies")
will have had their securities publicly traded, if at all, for only a short
period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable
trading pattern through economic cycles. The price volatility of Small-Cap
Companies and Mid-Cap Companies is relatively higher than larger, older and
more mature companies. The greater price volatility of Small-Cap Companies and
Mid-Cap Companies may result from the fact that there may be less market
liquidity, less information publicly available or fewer investors who monitor
the activities of these companies. In addition, the market prices of these
securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general
economic conditions. Some Small-Cap Companies or Mid-Cap Companies will not
have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to
demonstrate whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or
inflationary periods. Further, a variety of factors may affect the success of a
company's business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or
compensate for them, including domestic and international political
developments, government trade and fiscal policies, patterns of trade and war
or other military conflict which may affect industries or markets or the
economy generally.



Administration of the Trust



Distributions to Unitholders. Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account of the trust. Other receipts are credited to
the Capital Account of a trust. Income received by a trust will be distributed
on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in the prospectus on
a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown
in the prospectus. However, if set forth in Part A of the prospectus that the
trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis ("Income Averaging"), then
income received by the trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of
one-twelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing 12
months. All distributions will be net of applicable expenses. There is no
assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends
received may be used to pay expenses. In addition, excess amounts from the
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to
the unitholders then of record. Proceeds received from the disposition of any
of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution
date will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next
distribution date applicable to the Capital Account. The trustee shall be
required to make a distribution from the Capital Account if the cash balance on
deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at
least $1.00 per 100 units. The trustee is not required to pay interest on funds
held in the Capital or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon
and therefore benefits from the use of such funds). The trustee is authorized
to reinvest any funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts, pending
distribution, in U.S. Treasury obligations which mature on or before the next
applicable distribution date. Any obligations so acquired must be held until
they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested.


The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an
amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders' pro rata share
of the dividend distributions then held in the Income Account after deducting
estimated expenses. Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant
rate throughout the year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to
fluctuate. However, if the trust uses Income Averaging, the trust prorates the
income distribution on an annual basis and annual income distributions are
expected to vary from year to year. If the amount on deposit in the Income
Account is insufficient for payment of the amount of income to be distributed
on a monthly basis, the trustee shall advance out of its own funds and cause to
be deposited in and credited to such Income Account such amount as may be
required to permit payment of the monthly income distribution. The trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the trust, without interest, out of
income received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance and subject
to the condition that any such reimbursement shall be made only if it will not
reduce the funds in or available for the Income Account to an amount less than
required for the next ensuing distribution. Persons who purchase units will
commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner.
A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a unitholder of record, on
the date of settlement provided payment has been received. Notification to the
trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser, but in
the normal course of business such notice is provided by the selling
broker-dealer.


The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account
of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of a trust. The trustee also
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trust's assets until
such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the
appropriate accounts. In addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and
Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover
redemptions of units.


Distribution Reinvestment. Unitholders may elect to have distributions of
capital (including capital gains) or dividends, if any, or both automatically
invested into additional units of their trust without a sales fee.


Your trust will pay any deferred sales fee per unit regardless of any
sales fee discounts. However, if you elect to have distributions on your units
reinvested into additional units of your trust, you will be credited the amount
of any remaining deferred sales charge on such additional units at the time of
reinvestment.


Unitholders who are receiving distributions in cash may elect to
participate in distribution reinvestment by filing with the Program Agent an
election to have such distributions reinvested without charge. Such election
must be received by the Program Agent at least ten days prior to the record
date applicable to any distribution in order to be in effect for such record
date. Any such election shall remain in effect until a subsequent notice is
received by the Program Agent.


The Program Agent is The Bank of New York Mellon. All inquiries concerning
participating in distribution reinvestment should be directed to The Bank of
New York Mellon at its Unit Investment Trust Division office.


Statements to Unitholders. With each distribution, the trustee will
furnish to each registered holder a statement of the amount of income and the
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in
each case as a dollar amount per unit.


The accounts of a trust will not be audited annually unless the sponsor
determines that such an audit would be in the best interest of the unitholders
of the trust. If an audit is conducted, it will be done at the related trust's
expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor. The
accountants' report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon
written request. Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each
calendar year, the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during
the calendar year was a unitholder of a trust a statement, covering the
calendar year, generally setting forth for the trust:


(A)   As to the Income Account:


(1)   Income received;


(2)   Deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of
the trust and for redemptions of units, if any; and


(3)   The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a
dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit
outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year;
and


(B)   As to the Capital Account:


(1)   The dates of disposition of any securities and the net
proceeds received therefrom;


(2)   Deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and
expenses of the trust; and


(3)   The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions
expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on
the last business day of such calendar year; and


(C)   The following information:


(1)   A list of the securities as of the last business day of such
calendar year;


(2)   The number of units outstanding on the last business day of
such calendar year;


(3)   The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during
such calendar year; and


(4)   The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from
the Income and Capital Accounts separately stated, expressed
both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit
outstanding on the record dates for each such distribution.


Rights of Unitholders. A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption. The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to
claim an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for
partition or winding up of a trust. No unitholder shall have the right to
control the operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote
with respect to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a
trust.


Amendment and Termination. The trust agreement may be amended by the
trustee and the sponsor without the consent of any of the unitholders: (1) to
cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision which may be
defective or inconsistent; (2) to change any provision thereof as may be
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any successor
governmental agency; (3) to make such provisions as shall not materially
adversely affect the interests of the unitholders; or (4) to make such other
amendments as may be necessary for a trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company, in the case of a trust which has elected to qualify as such. The trust
agreement with respect to any trust may also be amended in any respect by the
sponsor and the trustee, or any of the provisions thereof may be waived, with
the consent of the holders of units representing 66 2/3% of the units then
outstanding of the trust, provided that no such amendment or waiver will reduce
the interest of any unitholder thereof without the consent of such unitholder
or reduce the percentage of units required to consent to any such amendment or
waiver without the consent of all unitholders of the trust. In no event shall
the trust agreement be amended to increase the number of units of a trust
issuable thereunder, to permit the acquisition of any securities in addition to
or in substitution for those initially deposited in the trust or to adversely
affect the characterization of a trust as a regulated investment company for
federal income tax purposes, except in accordance with the provisions of the
trust agreement. The trustee shall promptly notify unitholders of the substance
of any such amendment.


The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination
date set forth in Part A of the prospectus. If the value of a trust shall be
less than the applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus, the trustee
may, in its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate
the trust. A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units
representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding. In addition, the
sponsor may terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index
is no longer maintained.


Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the mandatory
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection
with the termination of the trust. The sponsor may assist the trustee in these
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.


The trustee will attempt to sell the securities as quickly as it can
during the termination proceedings without, in its judgment, materially
adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but it is expected that
all of the securities will in any event be disposed of within a reasonable time
after a trust's termination. The sponsor does not anticipate that the period
will be longer than one month, and it could be as short as one day, depending
on the liquidity of the securities being sold. The liquidity of any security
depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount that the
sponsor has available for sale on any particular day. Of course, no assurances
can be given that the market value of the securities will not be adversely
affected during the termination proceedings.


Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata
share of the balances remaining in the Income and Capital Accounts of the
trust.


The sponsor currently intends, but is not obligated, to offer for sale
units of a subsequent series of certain trusts at approximately one year after
the inception date of such trusts. If the sponsor does offer such units for
sale, unitholders may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a
public offering price which includes a reduced sales fee. There is, however, no
assurance that units of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at
that time, or if offered, that there will be sufficient units available for
sale to meet the requests of any or all unitholders.


The Trustee. The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its Unit
Investment Trust Division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Fl., Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone 1-800-701-8178. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust. In accordance with the trust
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units
held by, every unitholder of a trust. Such books and records shall be open to
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business
hours. The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation. The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a
current list of the securities held in each trust. Pursuant to the trust
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.


Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor. The trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before the date specified
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor
trustee promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been
appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor. The sponsor may at any time
remove the trustee, with or without cause, and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the trust agreement. Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor. Upon execution of a written
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the
successor. The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.


The Sponsor. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC specializes in the
creation, development and distribution of investment solutions for advisors and
their valued clients. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC was created as Ranson
& Associates, Inc. in 1995 and is the successor sponsor to unit investment
trusts formerly sponsored by EVEREN Unit Investment Trusts, a service of EVEREN
Securities, Inc. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC is also the sponsor and
successor sponsor of Series of Ranson Unit Investment Trusts and The Kansas
Tax-Exempt Trust and Multi-State Series of The Ranson Municipal Trust. On
October 29, 2001, Ranson & Associates, Inc. was acquired by Claymore Group LLC.
The sale to Claymore Group LLC was financed by a loan from The Bank of New York
Mellon, the trustee. In November 2001, the sponsor changed its name from Ranson
& Associates, Inc. to Claymore Securities, Inc. On October 14, 2009, Guggenheim
Partners, LLC acquired Claymore Securities, Inc. Since the finalization of the
acquisition, Claymore Securities, Inc. has been operating as a subsidiary of
Guggenheim Partners, LLC. On September 27, 2010, Claymore Securities, Inc.
officially changed its name to Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC.


Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC has been active in public and corporate
finance, has underwritten closed-end funds and has sold bonds, mutual funds,
closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, structured products and unit
investment trusts and maintained secondary market activities relating thereto.
At present, Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC which is a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), is the sponsor to each of the
above-named unit investment trusts. The sponsor's offices are located at 2455
Corporate West Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532.


If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the
trust agreement.


The Supervisor and the Evaluator. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC, the
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor. The evaluator and supervisor
may resign or be removed by the trustee in which event the trustee is to use
its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor. Such resignation or
removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor
evaluator. If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has accepted
appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the evaluator may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.
Notice of such registration or removal and appointment shall be mailed by the
trustee to each unitholder. As evaluator, Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC
utilizes the trustee to perform certain evaluation services.


Limitations on Liability. The sponsor is liable for the performance of its
obligations arising from its responsibilities under the trust agreement, but
will be under no liability to the unitholders for taking any action or
refraining from any action in good faith pursuant to the trust agreement or for
errors in judgment, except in cases of its own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its duties thereunder. The
sponsor shall not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale of any securities.


The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities. In the event
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable
for any such action taken by it in good faith. The trustee shall not be
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or
in respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof. In addition, the
trust agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of
the trustee.


The unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the evaluator and
shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. The trust agreement
provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made in good
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided,
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its
obligations under the trust agreement.



Expenses of the Trust



The sponsor does not charge a trust an annual advisory fee. The sponsor
will receive a portion of the sale commissions paid in connection with the
purchase of units and will share in profits, if any, related to the deposit of
securities in the trust. The sponsor and/or its affiliates do, also, receive an
annual fee as set forth in Part A of the prospectus for maintaining
surveillance over the portfolio and for performing certain administrative
services for the trust (the "Sponsor's Supervisory Fee"). In providing such
supervisory services, the sponsor may purchase research from a variety of
sources, which may include dealers of the trusts. If so provided in Part A of
the prospectus, the sponsor may also receive an annual fee for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services for a trust (the "Bookkeeping and
Administrative Fee"). Such services may include, but are not limited to, the
preparation of various materials for unitholders and providing account
information to the unitholders. If so provided in Part A of the prospectus, the
evaluator may also receive an annual fee for performing evaluation services for
the trusts (the "Evaluator's Fee"). In addition, if so provided in Part A of
the prospectus, a trust may be charged an annual licensing fee to cover
licenses for the use of service marks, trademarks, trade names and intellectual
property rights and/or for the use of databases and research. The trust will
bear all operating expenses. Estimated annual trust operating expenses are as
set forth in Part A of the prospectus; if actual expenses are higher than the
estimate, the excess will be borne by the trust. The estimated expenses include
listing fees but do not include the brokerage commissions and other
transactional fees payable by the trust in purchasing and selling securities.


The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in Part A of the
prospectus. The trustee's fee, which is paid monthly, is based on the largest
number of units of a trust outstanding at any time during the primary offering
period. After the primary offering period, the fee shall accrue daily and be
based on the number of units outstanding on the first business day of each
calendar year in which the fee is calculated or the number of units outstanding
at the end of the primary offering period, as appropriate. The Sponsor's
Supervisory Fee, the Bookkeeping and Administrative Fee and the Evaluator's Fee
are paid monthly and are based on the largest number of units of a trust
outstanding at any time during the primary offering period. After the primary
offering period, these fees shall accrue daily and be based on the number of
units outstanding on the first business day of each calendar year in which a
fee is calculated or the number of units outstanding at the end of the primary
offering period, as appropriate. The trustee benefits to the extent there are
funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in the
Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing and
the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee. Part of the
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from
the use of these funds. In addition, the Sponsor's Supervisory Fee, Bookkeeping
and Administrative Fee, Evaluator's Fee and the Trustee's Fee may be adjusted
in accordance with the cumulative percentage increase of the United States
Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent"
since the establishment of the trust. In addition, with respect to any fees
payable to the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor for providing bookkeeping
and other administrative services, supervisory services and evaluation
services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such
services for a trust, but at no time will the total amount received for such
services, in the aggregate, rendered to all unit investment trusts of which
Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC is the sponsor in any calendar year exceed
the actual cost to the sponsor or its affiliates of supplying such services, in
the aggregate, in such year. In addition, the trustee may reimburse the sponsor
out of its own assets for services performed by employees of the sponsor in
connection with the operation of your trust.


The trust will also pay a fee to the sponsor for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust objective, policies, composition and
size, selecting service providers and information services, and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. Your trust pays this
"creation and development fee" as a fixed dollar amount at the close of the
initial offering period. The sponsor does not use the fee to pay distribution
expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: (a)
fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses, but not including any fees and expenses
charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of securities) and of counsel,
if any; (c) various governmental charges; (d) expenses and costs of any action
taken by the trustee to protect the trust or the rights and interests of the
unitholders; (e) indemnification of the trustee for any loss, liability or
expense incurred by it in the administration of the trust not resulting from
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part; (f)
indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred in
acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful
malfeasance or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust
agreement; (g) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial
offering period; and (h) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon
termination of the trust. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the
trust. Since the securities are all stocks, and the income stream produced by
dividend payments, if any, is unpredictable, the sponsor cannot provide any
assurance that dividends will be sufficient to meet any or all expenses of a
trust. If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell
securities to pay such amounts. These sales may result in capital gains or
losses to unitholders. It is expected that the income stream produced by
dividend payments may be insufficient to meet the expenses of a trust and,
accordingly, it is expected that securities will be sold to pay all of the fees
and expenses of the trust.


The trust shall also bear the expenses associated with updating the
trust's registration statement and maintaining registration or qualification of
the units and/or a trust under federal or state securities laws subsequent to
initial registration. Such expenses shall include legal fees, accounting fees,
typesetting fees, electronic filing expenses and regulatory filing fees. The
expenses associated with updating registration statements have been
historically paid by a unit investment trust's sponsor.



Portfolio Transactions and Brokerage Allocation



When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the
securities in the trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the supervisor to specify minimum amounts (such
as 100 shares) in which blocks of securities are to be sold. In effecting
purchases and sales of a trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,
including brokers which may be affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or
dealers participating in the offering of units.



Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units



Public Offering Price. Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price (which is based on the aggregate underlying value of the securities in
the trust and includes the initial sales fee plus a pro rata share of any
accumulated amounts in the accounts of the trust). The initial sales fee is
equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the
remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee ("C&D Fee").
The maximum sales fee is set forth in Part A of the prospectus. The deferred
sales fee and the C&D Fee will be collected as described in this prospectus.
Units purchased subsequent to the initial deferred sales fee payment will be
subject to the initial sales fee, the remaining deferred sales fee payments and
the C&D Fee. Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable
deferred sales fee has been collected will be assessed the remaining deferred
sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption. During the initial offering
period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of securities
to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a trust
("organization costs"). These organization costs include the cost of preparing
the registration statement, the trust indenture and other closing documents,
registering units with the Securities and Exchange Commission and states, the
initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees, fees paid to a portfolio
consultant for assisting the sponsor in selecting the trust's portfolio, and
the initial fees and expenses of the trustee. These costs will be deducted from
a trust as of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, at
the discretion of the sponsor. As indicated above, the initial public offering
price of the units was established by dividing the aggregate underlying value
of the securities by the number of units outstanding. Such price determination
as of the opening of business on the date a trust was created was made on the
basis of an evaluation of the securities in the trust prepared by the
evaluator. After the opening of business on this date, the evaluator will
appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying securities
as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock
Exchange is open and will adjust the public offering price of the units
commensurate with such valuation. Such public offering price will be effective
for all orders properly received at or prior to the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange on each such day. Orders received by the trustee, sponsor
or any dealer for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day
when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next
determination of price.


The value of the securities is determined on each business day by the
evaluator based on the closing sale prices on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq National Market System or by taking into account the same factors
referred to under "Computation of Redemption Price."


Public Distribution of Units. During the initial offering period, units of
a trust will be distributed to the public at the public offering price thereof.
Upon the completion of the initial offering, units which remain unsold or which
may be acquired in the secondary market may be offered at the public offering
price determined in the manner provided above.


The sponsor intends to qualify units of a trust for sale in a number of
states. Units will be sold through dealers who are members of FINRA and through
others. Broker-dealers and others will be allowed a concession or agency
commission in connection with the distribution of units during the initial
offering period as set forth in the prospectus.


Certain commercial banks may be making units of a trust available to their
customers on an agency basis. Furthermore, as a result of certain legislative
changes effective November 1999, banks are no longer prohibited from certain
affiliations with securities firms. This new legislation grants banks new
authority to conduct certain authorized activity, such as sales of units,
through financial subsidiaries. A portion of the sales charge discussed above
is retained by or remitted to the banks or their financial subsidiaries for
these agency and brokerage transactions. The sponsor reserves the right to
change the concessions or agency commissions set forth in the prospectus from
time to time. In addition to such concessions or agency commissions, the
sponsor may, from time to time, pay or allow additional concessions or agency
commissions, in the form of cash or other compensation, to dealers employing
registered representatives who sell, during a specified time period, a minimum
dollar amount of units of unit investment trusts underwritten by the sponsor.
At various times the sponsor may implement programs under which the sales force
of a broker or dealer may be eligible to win nominal awards for certain sales
efforts, or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such broker or dealer
that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the sponsor, or participates in sales programs sponsored by the
sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the
sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such
programs. Also, the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to
objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokers or
dealers for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to
result in sales of units of a trust. Such payments are made by the sponsor out
of its own assets, and not out of the assets of any trust. These programs will
not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that a trust
will receive from the units sold. The difference between the discount and the
sales charge will be retained by the sponsor.


The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.


Sponsor Profits. The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the public offering price of the units of a trust described in
the prospectus. In addition, the sponsor may realize a profit (or sustain a
loss) as of the date a trust is created resulting from the difference between
the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such
securities to the trust. Thereafter, on subsequent deposits the sponsor may
realize profits or sustain losses from such deposits. The sponsor may realize
additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units
as a result of changes in the daily market value of the securities in the
trust.


Market for Units. After the initial offering period, the sponsor may
maintain a market for units of a trust offered hereby and continuously offer to
purchase said units at prices, determined by the evaluator, based on the value
of the underlying securities. Unitholders who wish to dispose of their units
should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption
price and, if so, the amount thereof. Unitholders who sell or redeem units
prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been
collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at
the time of such sale or redemption. The offering price of any units resold by
the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective
prospectus describing such units. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale
of such units will belong to the sponsor. If the sponsor decides to maintain a
secondary market, it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust
if the supply of units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.


Redemption. A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making
a written request to the trustee at its Unit Investment Trust Division office
in the city of New York. Unitholders must sign the request, and such transfer
instrument, exactly as their names appear on the records of the trustee. If the
amount of the redemption is $500 or less and the proceeds are payable to the
unitholder(s) of record at the address of record, no signature guarantee is
necessary for redemptions by individual account owners (including joint
owners). Additional documentation may be requested, and a signature guarantee
is always required, from corporations, executors, administrators, trustees,
guardians or associations. The signatures must be guaranteed by a participant
in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other
signature guaranty program in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as
may be accepted by the trustee.


Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the third business
day following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the
"Redemption Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price,
determined as set forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of
the close of the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied
by the number of units being redeemed. Any units redeemed shall be canceled and
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished. The price
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of
redemption. Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or
redemption. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing
redemption requests.


Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax
identification number in the manner required by such regulations. Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by
the unitholder only when filing a tax return. Under normal circumstances the
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling
broker. However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up
withholding." In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such
number, one must be provided at the time redemption is requested. Any amounts
paid on redemption representing unpaid dividends shall be withdrawn from the
Income Account of a trust to the extent that funds are available for such
purpose. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the
Capital Account for a trust.


Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request an in-kind
distribution (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash
redemption. A unitholder may request a Distribution In Kind of an amount and
value of securities per unit equal to the redemption price per unit as
determined as of the evaluation time next following the tender, provided that
the tendering unitholder is (1) entitled to receive at least $25,000 of
proceeds as part of his or her distribution or if he paid at least $25,000 to
acquire the units being tendered and (2) the unitholder has elected to redeem
at least thirty business days prior to the termination of the trust. If the
unitholder meets these requirements, a Distribution In Kind will be made by the
trustee through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book
entry form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at
Depository Trust Company. The tendering unitholder shall be entitled to receive
whole shares of each of the securities comprising the portfolio of the trust
and cash from the Capital Account equal to the fractional shares to which the
tendering unitholder is entitled. The trustee shall make any adjustments
necessary to reflect differences between the redemption price of the units and
the value of the securities distributed in kind as of the date of tender. If
funds in the Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required cash
distribution to the tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities. The
in-kind redemption option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. The
trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for
the redemption of units. To the extent that securities are sold or redeemed in
kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced
but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same
proportional interest in each security. Sales may be required at a time when
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than
might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or
less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the
securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.


Unitholders of a trust that holds closed-end funds or other investment
company securities who request a Distribution In Kind will be subject to any
12b-1 Fees or other service or distribution fees applicable to the underlying
securities.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for more
than three business days following the day on which tender for redemption is
made (1) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed,
other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as
determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York
Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) for any period during which an emergency
exists as a result of which disposal by the trustee of securities is not
reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine
the value of the underlying securities in accordance with the trust agreement;
or (3) for such other period as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by
order permit. The trustee is not liable to any person in any way for any loss
or damage which may result from any such suspension or postponement.


Computation of Redemption Price. The redemption price per unit (as well as
the secondary market public offering price) will generally be determined on the
basis of the last sale price of the securities in a trust. The redemption price
per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in a trust determined generally on
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of
being collected and (ii) the value of the securities in the trust less (a)
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the
trust, (b) any amount owing to the trustee for its advances and (c) the accrued
expenses or remaining deferred sales fees of the trust. During the initial
offering period, the redemption price and the secondary market repurchase price
will also include estimated organizational costs. The evaluator may determine
the value of the securities in the trust in the following manner: if the
securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the
Nasdaq National Market System, such evaluation shall generally be based on the
last available sale price on or immediately prior to the Evaluation Time on the
exchange or Nasdaq National Market System which is the principal market
therefor, which shall be deemed to be the New York Stock Exchange if the
securities are listed thereon (unless the evaluator deems such price
inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) or, if there is no such available sale
price on such exchange, at the last available bid prices (offer prices for
primary market purchases) of the securities. Securities not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange but principally traded on the Nasdaq National Market System
will be valued at the Nasdaq National Market System's official closing price.
If the securities are not so listed or, if so listed, the principal market
therefor is other than on such exchange or there is no such available sale
price on such exchange, such evaluation shall generally be based on the
following methods or any combination thereof whichever the evaluator deems
appropriate: (i) on the basis of the current bid price (offer prices for
primary market purchases) for comparable securities (unless the evaluator deems
such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation), (ii) by determining the
valuation of the securities on the bid side (offer side for primary market
purchases) of the market by appraisal or (iii) by any combination of the above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the evaluator or its designee, will generally
value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair
value which may be other than their market price. If the trust holds securities
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the evaluation of such
security is based upon U.S. dollars based on current bid side (offer side for
primary market purchases) exchange rates (unless the evaluator deems such
prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation).


Retirement Plans. A trust may be well suited for purchase by Individual
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement
plans. Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from federal taxation. All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for
special income averaging or tax deferred rollover treatment. Investors
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan. Such plans are offered
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions. The trust will lower the
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts to 1 unit. Fees and charges
with respect to such plans may vary.


Ownership of Units. Ownership of units will not be evidenced by
certificates. All evidence of ownership of units will be recorded in book entry
form at Depository Trust Company ("DTC") through an investor's brokers'
account. Units held through DTC will be registered in the nominee name of Cede
& Co. Individual purchases of beneficial ownership interest in the trust will
be made in book entry form through DTC. Ownership and transfer of units will be
evidenced and accomplished by book entries made by DTC and its participants.
DTC will record ownership and transfer of the units among DTC participants and
forward all notices and credit all payments received in respect of the units
held by the DTC participants. Beneficial owners of units will receive written
confirmation of their purchases and sale from the broker dealer or bank from
whom their purchase was made. Units are transferable by making a written
request properly accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer
which should be sent registered or certified mail for the protection of the
unitholder. Record holders must sign such written request exactly as their
names appear on the records of the trust. The signatures must be guaranteed by
a participant in the STAMP or such other signature guaranty program in addition
to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be acceptable by the trustee.


Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any multiple
thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement. Fractions of units, if
any, will be computed to three decimal places.



Taxes



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning units of the trust. This section is current as of the
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you
are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with
special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state,
local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion
of counsel to the sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust. This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Trust. The trust is expected to hold one or more of the
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) shares (the "RIC Shares")
in funds qualifying as regulated investment companies ("RICs") that are treated
as interests in regulated investment companies for federal income tax purposes.
It is possible that your trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the
assets held by the trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets
and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the
federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.


Trust Status. If your trust is at all times operated in accordance with
the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income
tax law are met, the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes. As a unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro
rata portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to
have received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if
any) from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received
by you if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect
to have your distributions reinvested into additional units. In addition, the
income from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses.
Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from a
trust may also be subject to a new 3.8% "Medicare tax" imposed for taxable
years beginning after 2012. This tax will generally apply to your net
investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold
amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing joint returns
and $200,000 in the case of single individuals. Interest that is excluded from
gross income, including any exempt-interest dividends from the RIC Shares held
by a trust, are generally not included in your net investment income for
purposes of this tax.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of
your units or redeem your units for cash, you will also generally recognize
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract
your tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your units, including sales
charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date
you acquire your units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units (for example, in the case of
certain dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and
profits).


If you are an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for
net capital gain is generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15%
for taxpayers in the 25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in
the 10% and 15% tax brackets. Capital gains may also be subject to the Medicare
tax described above.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.


Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the
Stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain
(as discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are
satisfied.


Dividends from RIC Shares. Some dividends on the RIC Shares may be
reported by the RIC as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as
long-term capital gains. Some capital gain dividends may be taxed at a maximum
stated rate of 25%. Some dividends on the RIC shares may qualify as
"exempt-interest dividends," which generally are excluded from your gross
income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all of the exempt-interest
dividends, however, may be taken into account in determining your alternative
minimum tax, and may have other tax consequences (e.g., they may affect the
amount of your Social Security benefits that are taxed). Other dividends on the
RIC Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income. Certain
ordinary income dividends from a RIC may qualify to be taxed at the same rates
that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding
period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable
to qualifying dividends received by the RIC itself. RICs are required to
provide notice to their shareholders of the amount of any distribution that may
be taken into account as a dividend that is eligible for the capital gains tax
rates. If you hold a unit for six months or less or if your trust holds a RIC
Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the
disposition of such RIC Share will generally be disallowed to the extent of any
exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not
disallowed, it will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to have been received)
with respect to such RIC Share. Distributions of income or capital gains
declared on the RIC Shares in October, November or December will be deemed to
have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared, even when
paid by the RIC during the following January.


Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns units will generally
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received by your trust, because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from
RICs. However, certain dividends on the RIC Shares that are attributable to
dividends received by the RIC itself from certain domestic corporations may be
reported by the RIC as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may request an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your units at any time prior to 30 business days before your trust's
termination. However, this ability to request an in-kind distribution will
terminate at any time that the number of outstanding units has been reduced to
10% or less of the highest number of units issued by the trust. By electing to
receive an in-kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets plus, possibly,
cash. You will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust
Assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the
same Trust Assets held by your trust. However, if you also receive cash in
exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will
generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of
cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over
into a future series of the trust, it is considered a sale for federal income
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and
any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in
connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of
your trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses.
You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the
same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat
some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Some individuals may also be
subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions,
depending on their income.


Because some of the RICs may pay exempt-interest dividends, which are
treated as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes, you may not be
able to deduct some of your share of the trust expenses. In addition, you may
not be able to deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or
continue to purchase or carry your units.


Foreign Investors, Taxes and Investments. Distributions by your trust that
are treated as U.S. source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of
domestic corporations) will generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and
withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign
corporations or other non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If
you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be
subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some or
all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of
your units, provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your
tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt
for U.S. tax purposes. Distributions after June 30, 2014 may be subject to a
U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain
non-U.S. financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with
the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not
resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the
U.S. Treasury and (ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide
certain certifications and information about the entity's U.S. owners.
Dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after
December 31, 2016. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to
other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding
taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the
grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any
foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be
entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.


Under certain circumstances, a RIC may elect to pass through to its
shareholders certain foreign taxes paid by the RIC. If the RIC makes this
election with respect to RIC Shares, you must include in your income for
federal income tax purposes your portion of such taxes and you may be entitled
to a credit or deduction for such taxes.


If any U.S. investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly 10
percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign
corporation, and all U.S. shareholders of that corporation collectively own
more than 50 percent of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation, the
foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (a
"CFC"). If you own 10 percent or more of a CFC (through your trust and in
combination with your other investments), or possibly if your trust owns 10
percent or more of a CFC, you will be required to include certain types of the
CFC's income in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes whether or
not such income is distributed to your trust or to you.


A foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign
investment company (a "PFIC") if 75 percent or more of its income is passive
income or if 50 percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive
income. If your trust purchases shares in a PFIC, you may be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the
disposition of such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any
gain may be recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the
lower net capital gains tax rate. Additional charges in the nature of interest
may also be imposed on you. Certain elections may be available with respect to
PFICs that would limit these consequences. However, these elections would
require you to include certain income of the PFIC in your taxable income even
if not distributed to your trust or to you, or require you to annually
recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the
PFIC, thus requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in
excess of your actual distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions
of PFIC stock during a particular year. Dividends paid by PFICs are not
eligible to be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate.


New York Tax Status. Based on the advice of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, special
counsel to your trust for New York tax matters, under the existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York, your trust will not be taxed as a
corporation, and the income of your trust will be treated as the income of the
unitholders in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should
consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local taxation
with respect to your units.

Description of Ratings




Standard & Poor's Issue Credit Ratings



A Standard & Poor's issue credit rating is a forward-looking opinion about
the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial
obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a specific financial
program (including ratings on medium-term note programs and commercial paper
programs). It takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors,
insurers, or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into
account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. The opinion
reflects Standard & Poor's view of the obligor's capacity and willingness to
meet its financial commitments as they come due, and may assess terms, such as
collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate payment in
the event of default.


Issue credit ratings can be either long-term or short-term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in
the relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper.
Short-term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor
with respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual
rating, in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition
to the usual long-term rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term
ratings.


The ratings and other credit related opinions of Standard & Poor's and its
affiliates are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not
statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell any securities
or make any investment decisions. Standard & Poor's assumes no obligation to
update any information following publication. Users of ratings and credit
related opinions should not rely on them in making any investment decision.
Standard & Poor's opinions and analyses do not address the suitability of any
security. Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC does not act as a fiduciary
or an investment advisor. While Standard & Poor's has obtained information from
sources it believes to be reliable, Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit
and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any
information it receives. Ratings and credit related opinions may be changed,
suspended, or withdrawn at any time.


Long-term issue credit ratings


Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


o     Likelihood of payment-capacity and willingness of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with
the terms of the obligation;


o     Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


o     Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under
the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


Issue ratings are an assessment of default risk, but may incorporate an
assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default.
Junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations, to
reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation
may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations, secured
and unsecured obligations, or operating company and holding company
obligations).


AAA   An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by
Standard & Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.


AA    An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations
only to a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is very strong.


A     An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.


BBB   An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.

However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are
more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC," and "C" are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the
least degree of speculation and "C" the highest. While such
obligations will likely have some quality and protective
characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or
major exposures to adverse conditions.


BB    An obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions
which could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


B     An obligation rated "B" is more vulnerable to nonpayment than
obligations rated "BB," but the obligor currently has the capacity
to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse
business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the
obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


CCC   An obligation rated "CCC" is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic
conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet
its financial commitment on the obligation.


CC    An obligation rated "CC" is currently highly vulnerable to
nonpayment.


C     A "C" rating is assigned to obligations that are CURRENTLY HIGHLY
VULNERABLE to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages
allowed by the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer
that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which
have not experienced a payment default. Among others, the 'C' rating
may be assigned to subordinated debt, preferred stock or other
obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance
with the instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the subject
of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is
either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other
instruments having a total value that is less than par.


D     An obligation rated "D" is in payment default. The "D" rating
category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the
date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless
Standard & Poor's believes that such payments will be made during
such grace period. The "D" rating also will be used upon the filing
of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if
payments on an obligation are jeopardized.


Plus (+) or minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories.


NR    This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard
& Poor's does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of
policy.

the Prospectus.


(11) The first paragraph of Section 5.01 is hereby amended and restated to
read as follows:


Section 5.01. Trust Evaluation. As of the Evaluation Time (a) on the last
Business Day of each year, (b) on the day on which any Unit is tendered for
redemption and (c) on any other day desired by the Trustee or requested by the
Depositor, the Trustee shall: Add (i) all moneys on deposit in a Trust
(excluding (1) cash, cash equivalents or Letters of Credit deposited pursuant to

Section 2.01 hereof for the purchase of Contract Securities, unless such cash or
Letters of Credit have been deposited in the Interest and Principal Accounts
because of failure to apply such moneys to the purchase of Contract Securities
pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2.01, 3.03 and 3.04 hereof and (2) moneys
credited to the Reserve Account pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof), plus (ii) the
aggregate Evaluation of all Securities (including Contract Securities and
Reinvestment Securities) on deposit in such Trust as is determined by the
Evaluator (such evaluations shall take into account and itemize separately (i)
the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected from
matured interest coupons or bonds matured or called for redemption prior to
maturity, (ii) the value of each issue of the Securities in the Trust on the bid
side of the market as determined by the Evaluator pursuant to Section 4.01, and

(iii) interest accrued thereon not subject to collection and distribution). For
each such Evaluation there shall be deducted from the sum of the above (i)
amounts representing any applicable taxes or governmental charges payable out of
the respective Trust and for which no deductions shall have previously been made
for the purpose of addition to the Reserve Account, (ii) amounts representing
estimated accrued fees of the Trust and expenses of such Trust including but not
limited to unpaid fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Evaluator, the
Supervisor, the Depositor and bond counsel, in each case as reported by the
Trustee to the Evaluator on or prior to the date of evaluation, (iii) any moneys
identified by the Trustee, as of the date of the Evaluation, as held for
distribution to Unitholders of record as of a Record Date or for payment of the
Redemption Value of Units tendered prior to such date and (iv) unpaid
organization costs in the estimated amount per Unit set forth in the Prospectus.
The resulting figure is herein called a "Trust Fund Evaluation." The value of
the pro rata share of each Unit of the respective Trust determined on the basis
of any such evaluation shall be referred to herein as the "Unit Value."


(12) Article III is hereby amended by adding the following section:


Section 3.23. Bookkeeping and Administrative Expenses. If so provided in
the Prospectus, as compensation for providing bookkeeping and other
administrative services of a character described in Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 to the extent such services are in addition to,
and do not duplicate, the services to be provided hereunder by the Trustee or
the Depositor for providing supervisory services, the Depositor shall receive at
the times specified in Section 3.05, against a statement or statements therefor
submitted to the Trustee an aggregate annual fee in an amount which shall not
exceed that amount set forth in the Prospectus, calculated as specified in

Section 3.05. Such compensation may, from time to time, be adjusted provided
that the total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such adjustment,
exceed the percentage of the total increase, during the period from the Trust
Agreement to the date of any such increase, in consumer prices for services as
measured by the United States Department of Labor Consumer Price Index entitled
"All Services Less Rent of Shelter" or similar index as described under Section

3.18. The consent or concurrence of any Unitholder hereunder shall not be
required for any such adjustment or increase. Such compensations shall be paid
by the Trustee, upon receipt of invoice therefor from the Depositor, upon which,
as to the cost incurred by the Depositor of providing services hereunder the
Trustee may rely, and shall be charged against the Income and Capital Accounts
as specified in Section 3.05. The Trustee shall have no liability to any
Unitholder or other person for any payment made in good faith pursuant to this
Section.


If the cash balance in the Income and Capital Accounts shall be
insufficient to provide for amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.23, the
Trustee shall have the power to sell (1) Securities from the current list of
Securities designated to be sold pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof, or (2) if no
such Securities have been so designated, such Securities as the Trustee may see
fit to sell in its own discretion, and to apply the proceeds of any such sale in
payment of the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.23. Any moneys payable
to the Depositor pursuant to this Section 3.23 shall be secured by a prior lien
on the Trust except that no such lien shall be prior to any lien in favor of the
Trustee under the provisions of Section 6.04.


Any moneys payable to the Depositor pursuant to this Section 3.23 shall be
secured by a prior lien on the Trust except that no such lien shall be prior to
any lien in favor of the Trustee under the provisions of Section 6.04.


(13) The phrases "supervisory services," "supervisory portfolio services"
and "portfolio supervisory services" in Sections 3.18 are hereby replaced with
the phrase "portfolio supervisory services and bookkeeping and administrative
expenses."


(14) Section 7.05 is hereby amended and replaced in its entirety with the
following:


Section 7.05. Compensation. The Depositor shall receive at the times set
forth in Sections 3.05, 3.18, 3.23 and 4.03 as compensation for performing
portfolio supervisory services, bookkeeping and administrative expenses and
evaluation services, such amount and for such periods as specified the
Prospectus and/or Reference Trust Agreement. The compensation for providing
portfolio supervisory services, bookkeeping and administrative expenses and
evaluation services shall be made on the basis of the largest number of units
outstanding at any time during the period for which such compensation is being
computed. At no time, however, will the total amount received by the Depositor
for services rendered to all series of Guggenheim Defined Portfolios in any
calendar year exceed the aggregate cost to them of supplying such services in
such year. Such rate may be increased by the Trustee from time to time, without
the consent or approval of any Unitholder, or the Depositor, by amounts not
exceeding the proportionate increase during the period from the date of such
Prospectus and/or Reference Trust Agreement to the date of any such increase, in
consumer prices as published either under the classification "All Services Less
Rent" in the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of
Labor or, IF such Index is no longer published, a similar index.


In the event that any amount of the compensation paid to the Depositor
pursuant to Sections 3.05, 3.18 and 3.23 and 4.03 is found to be an improper
charge against a Trust, the Depositor shall reimburse the Trust in such amount.
An improper charge shall be established if a final judgment or order for
reimbursement of the Trust shall be rendered against the Depositor and such
judgment or order shall not be effectively stayed or a final settlement is
established in which the Depositor agrees to reimburse the Trust for amounts
paid to the Depositor pursuant to this Section 7.05.


(15) The first two sentences of Section 3.22 are hereby amended and
replaced with the following:


Section 3.22. Creation and Development Fee. If the Prospectus related to a
Trust specifies a creation and development fee, the Trustee shall, on or
immediately after the end of the initial offering period, withdraw from the
Capital Account, an amount equal to the unpaid creation and development fee as
of such date and credit such amount to a special non-Trust account designated by
the Depositor out of which the creation and development fee will be distributed
to the Depositor (the "Creation and Development Account"). The creation and
development fee is the per unit amount specified in the Prospectus for the
Trust.


(16) Article III is hereby amended by adding the following section:


Section 3.24. License Fees. If so provided in the Prospectus, the
Depositor may enter into a Licensing Agreement (the "Agreement") with a licensor
(the "Licensor") described in the Prospectus in which the Trust(s), as
consideration for the licenses granted by the Licensor for the right to use its
trademarks and trade names, intellectual property rights or for the use of
databases and research owned by the Licensor, will pay a fee set forth in the
Agreement to the applicable Licensor or the Depositor to reimburse the Depositor
for payment of the expenses.


If the Agreement provides for an annual license fee computed in whole or
part by reference to the average daily net asset value of the Trust assets, for
purpose of calculating the accrual of estimated expenses such annual fee shall
accrue at a daily rate and the Trustee is authorized to compute an estimated
license fee payment (i) until the Depositor has informed the Trustee that there
will be no further deposits of additional Securities, by reference to an
estimate of the average daily net asset value of the Trust assets which the
Depositor shall provide the Trustee, (ii) thereafter and during the calendar
quarter in which the last business day of the period described in clause (i)
occurs, by reference to the net asset value of the Trust assets as of such last
business day, and (iii) during each subsequent calendar quarter, by reference to
the net asset value of the Trust assets as of the last business day of the
preceding calendar quarter. The Trustee shall adjust the net asset value (Trust
Fund Evaluation) as of the dates specified in the preceding sentence to account
for any variation between accrual of estimated license fee and the license fee
payable pursuant to the Agreement, but such adjustment shall not affect
calculations made prior thereto and no adjustment shall be made in respect
thereof.


(17) Sections 2.05(a) and 2.05(b) are hereby amended and replaced in their
entirety with the following:


Section 2.05. Deposit of Additional Securities. (a) Subject to the
requirements set forth below in this Section, the Depositor may, on any Business
Day (the "Trade Date"), subscribe for Additional Units as follows:


(1) Prior to the Evaluation Time defined in Section 5.01 on the Trade
Date, the Depositor shall provide notice (the "Subscription Notice") to the
Trustee of the Depositor's intention to subscribe for Additional Units. The
Subscription Notice shall identify the Additional Securities to be acquired
(unless such Additional Securities are a precise replication of the then
existing portfolio) and shall either (i) specify the quantity of Additional
Securities to be deposited by the Depositor on the settlement date for such
subscription or (ii) instruct the Trustee to purchase Additional Securities with
an aggregate cost as specified in the Subscription Notice.


(2) Promptly following the Evaluation Time on such Business Day, the
Depositor shall verify with the Trustee, the number of Additional Units to be
created.


(3) Not later than the time on the settlement date for such subscription
when the Trustee is to deliver the Additional Units created thereby (which time
shall not be later than the time by which the Trustee is required to settle any
contracts for the purchase of Additional Securities entered into by the Trustee
pursuant to the instruction of the Depositor referred to in subparagraph (1)
above), the Depositor shall deposit with the Trustee (i) any Additional
Securities specified in the Subscription Notice (or contracts to purchase such
Additional Securities together with cash or a letter of credit in the amount
necessary to settle such contracts) or (ii) cash or a letter of credit in the
amount equal to the aggregate cost of the Additional Securities to be purchased
by the Trustee, as specified in the Subscription Notice, together with, in each
case, Cash defined below. "Cash" means, as to the Capital Account, cash or other
property (other than Securities) on hand in the Capital Account or receivable
and to be credited to the Capital Account as of the Evaluation Time on the
Business Day preceding the Trade Date (other than amounts to be distributed
solely to persons other than persons receiving the distribution from the Capital
Account as holders of Additional Units created by the deposit), and, as to the
Income Account, cash or other property (other than Securities) received by the
Trust as of the Evaluation Time on the Business Day preceding the Trade Date or
receivable by the Trust in respect of dividends or other distributions declared
but not received as of the Evaluation Time on the Business Day preceding the
Trade Date, reduced by the amount of any cash or other property received or
receivable on any Security allocable (in accordance with the Trustee's
calculation of the monthly distribution from the Income Account pursuant to

Section 3.05) to a distribution made or to be made in respect of a Record Date
occurring prior to the Trade Date. Each deposit made pursuant to this Section
2.05 shall replicate, to the extent practicable, the portfolio immediately prior
to such deposit.


(4) On the settlement date for a subscription, the Trustee shall, in
exchange for the Securities and cash or Letter of Credit described above, issue
and deliver to or on the order of the Depositor the number of Units verified by
the Depositor with the Trustee. No Unit to be issued pursuant to this paragraph
shall be issued or delivered unless and until Securities, cash or a Letter of
Credit is received in exchange therefor and no person shall have any claim to
any Unit not so issued and delivered or any interest in the Trust in respect
thereof.


(5) Any Additional Securities shall be held, administered and applied by
the Trustee in the same manner as herein provided for the Securities.


(6) The acceptance of Additional Units by the Depositor in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section shall be deemed a certification
by the Depositor that the deposit or purchase of Additional Securities
associated therewith complies with the conditions of this Section 2.05.


(7) Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event that the Depositor's
Subscription Notice shall instruct the Trustee to purchase Additional Securities
in an amount which, when added to the purchase amount of all other unsettled
contracts entered into by the Trustee, exceeds 25% of the value of the
Securities then held (taking into account the value of contracts to purchase
Securities only to the extent that there has been deposited with the Trustee
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to settle their
purchase), the Depositors shall deposit with the Trustee concurrently with the
Subscription Notice cash or a letter of credit in an amount such that, when
added to 25% of the value of the Securities then held (determined as above) the
aggregate value shall be not less than the purchase amount of the securities to
be purchased pursuant to such Subscription Notice.


(b) Instructions to purchase Additional Securities under this Section
shall be in writing and shall direct the Trustee to purchase, or enter into
contracts to purchase, Additional Securities; such instructions shall also
specify the name, CUSIP number, if any, aggregate amount of each such Additional
Security and price or range of price. If, at the time of a subsequent deposit
under this Section, Securities of an Original Issue are unavailable, cannot be
purchased at reasonable prices or their purchase is prohibited or restricted by
applicable law, regulation or policies, in lieu of the portion of the deposit
that would otherwise be represented by those Securities, the Depositor may (A)
deposit (or instruct the Trustee to purchase) Securities of another Original
Issue or (B) deposit cash or a letter of credit with instructions to acquire the
Securities of such Original Issue when they become available.


(18) Section 4.01(b) is replaced in its entirety by the following:


(b) During the initial offering period such Evaluation shall be made in
the following manner: if the Securities are listed on a national securities
exchange or foreign securities exchange, such Evaluation shall generally be
based on the last available sale price on or immediately prior to the Evaluation
Time on the exchange which is the principal market therefor, which shall be
deemed to be the New York Stock Exchange if the Securities are listed thereon

(unless the Evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation)
or, if there is no such available sale price on such exchange, at the last
available offer prices of the Securities. Securities not listed on the New York
Stock Exchange but principally traded on the Nasdaq National Market System will
be valued at Nasdaq's official close price. If the Securities are not so listed
or, if so listed, the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange
or there is no such available sale price on such exchange, such Evaluation shall
generally be based on the following methods or any combination thereof whichever
the Evaluator deems appropriate: (i) on the basis of the current offer price for
comparable securities (unless the Evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a
basis for evaluation), (ii) by determining the valuation of the Securities on
the offer side of the market by appraisal or (iii) by any combination of the
above. If the Trust holds Securities denominated in a currency other than U.S.
dollars, the Evaluation of such Security shall be converted to U.S. dollars
based on current offering side exchange rates (unless the Evaluator deems such
prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation). The Evaluator shall add to the
Evaluation of each Security which is traded principally on a foreign securities
exchange the amount of any commissions and relevant taxes associated with the
acquisition of the Security. As used herein, the closing sale price is deemed to
mean the most recent closing sale price on the relevant securities exchange
immediately prior to the Evaluation Time. For each Evaluation, the Evaluator
shall also confirm and furnish to the Trustee and the Depositor, on the basis of
the information furnished to the Evaluator by the Trustee as to the value of all
Trust assets other than Securities, the calculation of the Trust Fund Evaluation
to be computed pursuant to Section 5.01.


(19) Section 4.01(c) is replaced in its entirety by the following:


(c) For purposes of the Trust Fund Evaluations required by Section 5.01 in
determining Redemption Value and Unit Value and for secondary market purchases,
Evaluation of the Securities shall be made in the manner described in 4.01(b),
on the basis of the last available bid prices of the Securities (rather than
offer prices), except in those cases in which the Securities are listed on a
national securities exchange or a foreign securities exchange and the last
available sale prices are utilized. In addition, with respect to each Security
which is traded principally on a foreign securities exchange, the Evaluator
shall (i) not make the addition specified in the fourth sentence of Section
4.01(b) and (ii) shall reduce the Evaluation of each Security by the amount of
any liquidation costs (other than brokerage costs incurred on any national
securities exchange) and any capital gains or other taxes which would be
incurred by the Trust upon the sale of such Security, such taxes being computed
as if the Security were sold on the date of the Evaluation.


(20) Section 9.05 is hereby revised to read as follows:


Section 9.05. Written Notice. Any notice, demand, direction or instruction
to be given to the Depositor, Evaluator or Supervisor hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be duly given if mailed or delivered to the Depositor, 2455
Corporate West Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532, or at such other address as shall
be specified by the Depositor to the other parties hereto in writing.


(21) The second paragraph of Section 6.02 is replaced in its entirety as
follows:


An audit of the accounts of each Trust shall not be conducted unless the
Depositor determines that such an audit is required. In the event that the
Depositor determines that an audit is required, the accounts of each Trust shall
be audited not less than annually by independent public accountants designated
from time to time by the Depositor and reports of such accountants shall be
furnished by the Trustee, upon request, to Unitholders. The Trustee, however, in
connection with any such audits shall not be obligated to use Trust assets to
pay for such audits in excess of the amounts, if any, indicated in the
Prospectus relating to such Trust. The Trustee shall maintain and provide, upon
the request of a Unitholder or the Depositor, the Unitholders' or the
Unitholder's designated representative with the cost basis of the Securities
represented by the Unitholder's Units.


(22) The first paragraph of Section 6.04 is replaced in its entirety as
follows:


Section 6.04. Compensation. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.14
hereof, the Trustee shall receive at the times set forth in Section 3.05, as
compensation for performing ordinary normal recurring services under this
Indenture, an amount calculated at the annual compensation rate stated in the
Prospectus. The Trustee shall charge a pro rated portion of its annual fee at
the times specified in Section 3.05, which pro rated portion shall be calculated
on the basis of the largest number of Units in such Trust at any time during the
primary offering period. After the primary offering period has terminated, the
fee shall accrue daily and be based on the number of Units outstanding on the
first business day of each calendar year in which the fee is calculated or the
number of Units outstanding at the end of the primary offering period, as
appropriate. The Trustee may from time to time adjust its compensation as set
forth above, provided that total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such
adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase, after the date hereof,
in consumer prices for services as measured by the United States Department of
Labor Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent," or, if such index
shall cease to be published, then as measured by the available index most nearly
comparable to such index. The consent or concurrence of any Unitholder hereunder
shall not be required for any such adjustment or increase, however, the consent
of the Depositor shall be required. Such compensation shall be charged by the
Trustee against the Income and Capital Accounts of each Trust; provided,
however, that such compensation shall be deemed to provide only for the usual,
normal and proper functions undertaken as Trustee pursuant to this Indenture.


(23) Section 2.03 is hereby amended and replaced in its entirety with the
following:


Section 2.03. Issuance of Units. By executing the Reference Trust
Agreement and receipt for deposited Securities, the Trustee will thereby
acknowledge receipt of the deposit of the Securities listed in the Schedules to
the Reference Trust Agreement and referred to in Section 2.01 hereof, and
simultaneously with the receipt of said deposit, has recorded on its books the
ownership, by the Depositor or such other person or persons as may be indicated
by the Depositor, of the aggregate number of Units specified in the Reference
Trust Agreement and has delivered, or on the order of the Depositor will
deliver, in exchange for such Securities, cash or a Letter of Credit,
documentation evidencing the ownership of the number of Units specified or, if
requested by the Depositor, the ownership by DTC of all such Units and will
cause such Units to be credited at DTC to the account of the Depositor or,
pursuant to the Depositor's direction and as hereafter provided, the account of
the issuer of the Letter of Credit referred to in Section 2.01. The number of
Units in a Trust may be increased through a split of the Units or decreased
through a reverse split thereof, as directed by the Depositor, on any day on
which the Depositor is the only Unitholder of such Trust, which revised number
of Units shall be recorded by the Trustee on its books. Effective as of the
Evaluation Time on October 7, 2013, in the event that the aggregate value of
Securities in the Trust has increased since the evaluation on October 4, 2013,
the Trustee shall issue such number of additional Units to the Unitholder of
outstanding Units as of the close of business on October 7, 2013, that the price
per Unit computed as of the Evaluation Time on October 7, 2013, plus the maximum
applicable sales charge shall equal approximately $10 per Unit (based on the
number of Units outstanding as of said Evaluation Time, including the additional
Units issued pursuant to this sentence); in the event that the aggregate value
of Securities in the Trust Fund has decreased since the evaluation on October 4,
2013, there will be a reverse split of the outstanding Units, and said
Unitholder will surrender to the Trustee for cancellation such number of Units,
that the price per Unit computed as of the Evaluation Time on October 7, 2013,
plus the maximum applicable sales charge shall equal approximately $10 per Unit
(based on the number of Units outstanding as of said Evaluation Time, reflecting
cancellation of Units pursuant to this sentence). The Trustee hereby agrees that
on the date of any deposit of additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.05 it
shall acknowledge that the additional Securities identified therein have been
deposited with it by recording on its books the ownership, by the Depositor or
such other person or persons as may be indicated by the Depositor, of the
aggregate number of Units to be issued in respect of such additional Securities
so deposited.


(24) Section 2.01 is hereby amended and replaced in its entirety with the
following:


Section 2.01. Deposit of Securities. The Depositor, on the date of the
Reference Trust Agreement, has deposited with the Trustee in trust the
Securities and contracts (or cash or a Letter of Credit in the amount necessary
to settle any contracts for the purchase of Securities entered into by the
Trustee pursuant to the instructions of the Depositor) for the purchase of
Contract Securities listed in the Schedules to the Reference Trust Agreement in
bearer form or duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by all necessary
instruments of assignment and transfer in proper form or Contract Securities
relating to such Securities to be held, managed and applied by the Trustee as
herein provided. The Depositor shall deliver the Securities listed on said
Schedules which were not actually delivered concurrently with the execution and
delivery of the Reference Trust Agreement and which were represented by Contract
Securities to the Trustee within 10 calendar days after said execution and
delivery (the "Delivery Period"). In the event that the purchase of Contract
Securities pursuant to any contract shall not be consummated in accordance with
said contract or if the Securities represented by Contract Securities are not
delivered to a Trust in accordance with this Section 2.01 and the moneys, or, if
applicable, the moneys drawn on the Letter of Credit, deposited by the Depositor
are not utilized for Section 3.17 purchases of Replacement Securities, such
funds, to the extent of the purchase price of Failed Contract Securities for
which no Replacement Security were acquired pursuant to Section 3.17, plus all
amounts described in the next succeeding sentence, shall be credited to the
Capital Account and distributed pursuant to Section 3.05 to Unitholders of
record as of the Income Account Record Date next following the failure of
consummation of such purchase. The Depositor shall cause to be refunded to each
Unitholder his pro rata portion of the sales charge levied on the sale of Units
to such Unitholder attributable to such Failed Contract Security. Any amounts
remaining from moneys drawn on the Letter of Credit which are not used to
purchase Replacement Securities or are not used to provide refunds to
Unitholders shall be paid to the Depositor. The Trustee is hereby irrevocably
authorized to effect registration or transfer of the Securities in fully
registered form to the name of the Trustee or to the name of its nominee or to
hold the Securities in a clearing agency registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or in a book entry system operated by the Federal Reserve
Board.


(25) Section 3.01 is hereby amended by as follows:


Section 3.01. Initial Costs. Subject to reimbursement as hereinafter
provided, the cost of organizing a Trust and sale of the Trust Units shall be
borne by the Depositor, provided, however, that the liability on the part of the
Depositor under this Section shall not include any fees or other expenses
incurred in connection with the administration of the Trust subsequent to the
deposit referred to in Section 2.01. Upon notification from the Depositor that
the primary offering period is concluded, or after six months, at the discretion
of the Depositor, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Account or Accounts
specified in the Prospectus or, if no Account is therein specified, from the
Capital Account as further set forth in Section 3.03, and pay to the Depositor
the Depositor's reimbursable expenses of organizing the Trust and sale of the
Trust Units in an amount certified to the Trustee by the Depositor but not in
excess of the estimated per-Unit amount set forth in the Prospectus multiplied
by the number of Units outstanding as of the conclusion of the primary offering
period. If the cash balance of the Capital Account is insufficient to make such
withdrawal, the Trustee shall, as directed by the Depositor, sell Securities
identified by the Depositor, or distribute to the Depositor Securities having a
value, as determined under Section 4.01 as of the date of distribution,
sufficient for such reimbursement. Securities sold or distributed to the
Depositor to reimburse the Depositor pursuant to this Section shall be sold or
distributed by the Trustee to the extent practicable, in the percentage ratio
then existing (unless the Trust elects to be treated as a "regulated investment
company" as defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code (the "Internal
Revenue Code"), in which case sales or distributions by the Trustee shall be
made in accordance with the instructions of the Depositor or its designees). The
reimbursement provided for in this Section shall be for the account of the
Unitholders of record at the conclusion of the primary offering period. Any
assets deposited with the Trustee in respect of the expenses reimbursable under
this Section shall be held and administered as assets of the Trust for all
purposes hereunder. The Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee any cash
identified in the Statement of Financial Condition of the Trust included in the
Prospectus not later than the First Settlement Date and the Depositor's
obligation to make such delivery shall be secured by the Letter of Credit
deposited pursuant to Section 2.01. Any cash which the Depositor has identified
as to be used for reimbursement of expenses pursuant to this Section shall be
held by the Trustee, without interest, and reserved for such purpose and,
accordingly, prior to the conclusion of the primary offering period, shall not
be subject to distribution or, unless the Depositor otherwise directs, used for
payment of redemptions in excess of the per-Unit amount payable pursuant to the
next sentence. If a Unitholder redeems Units prior to the conclusion of the
primary offering period, the Trustee shall pay to the Unitholder, in addition to
the Redemption Price of the tendered Units, an amount equal to the estimated
per-Unit cost of organizing the Trust and the sale of Trust Units set forth in
the Prospectus multiplied by the number of Units tendered for redemption; to the
extent the cash on hand in the Trust is insufficient for such payment, the
Trustee shall have the power to sell Securities in accordance with Section 5.02.
As used herein, the Depositor's reimbursable expenses of organizing the Trust
and sale of the Trust Units shall include the cost of the initial preparation
and typesetting of the registration statement, prospectuses (including
preliminary prospectuses), the indenture, and other documents relating to the
Trust, Securities and Exchange Commission and state blue sky registration fees,
the cost of the initial valuation of the portfolio and audit of the Trust, the
costs of a portfolio consultant, if any, the initial fees and expenses of the
Trustee, and legal and other out-of-pocket expenses related thereto but not
including the expenses incurred in the printing of preliminary prospectuses and
prospectuses, expenses incurred in the preparation and printing of brochures and
other advertising materials and any other selling expenses.


(26) Section 9.01(a)(iii) is hereby amended as follows:


(a)(iii) to make such other provision regarding matters or questions
arising hereunder as shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the
Unitholders; provided, however, that in no event may any amendment be made which
would adversely affect the status of a Trust for federal income tax purposes.


(27) Section 3.05 is hereby amended by adding the following as subsection
(b)(vi):


(b)(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be required
to make a distribution from the Income Account or the Capital Account unless the
aggregate cash available for distribution within the meaning of Treas. Reg.

Section 1.671-5(b)(5) from the Income Account and the Capital Account is equal
to or greater than .1% of the net asset value of the Trust on the related Record
Date, provided, however, that the Trustee shall in any event distribute the
balance of the Income Account and Capital Account on the Distribution Date
occurring in December of each year (including in such distribution income
receivable by the Trust on or prior to the December Distribution Date). This
provision is intended to comply with Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(v)(C),
and shall be interpreted consistent therewith and with any successor regulation.


(28) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no In Kind Distribution requests made
pursuant to Section 5.02 and submitted during the 30 business days prior to the
Trust's Mandatory Termination Date will be honored. In addition, no unitholder
will be eligible for an In Kind Distribution of securities pursuant to Section

9.02. Furthermore, the availability of In Kind Distributions may be modified or
discontinued as described in the Prospectus.


(29) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of the Trust, Section 3.07 shall be amended to add the following
immediately after Section 3.07(a)(ix):


(x) that as a result of the ownership of a Security, the Trust or its
Unitholders would be a direct or indirect shareholder of a passive foreign
investment company as defined in section 1297(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.


(xi) that such sale is desirable because a Security is determined to be
taxed as a partnership for U.S. Federal tax purposes.


(xii) that such sale is necessary for the Trust to comply with such
federal and/or state securities laws, regulations and/or regulatory actions and
interpretations which may be in effect from time to time.


(30) All references to The Bank of New York in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of the Trust shall be replaced with "The Bank of New York Mellon."


(31) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust, the eighth paragraph of Section 5.02 shall be amended to
read in its entirety as follows:


For the purpose of funding the Capital Account for payment of the
Redemption Value with respect to each tender of a Unit or Units for redemption,
the Depositor may direct the Trustee to sell and, in the absence of contrary
direction from the Depositor, the Trustee may sell, the pro rata amount of each
Security allocable to the tendered Units as soon as reasonably practicable
following such tender. In determining such pro rata amount, the Trustee may
apply the calendar month aggregation method provided in Treas. Reg. Section
1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(G)(3)(i). If the proceeds of such pro rata sales are
insufficient, the Trustee may (i) sell additional Securities as directed by the
Supervisor or, in the absence of direction, sell Securities in amounts which are
reasonably pro rata as determined by the Trustee or (ii) advance funds required
to pay the Redemption Value, provided that the Trustee shall have no obligation
to advance funds if the unreimbursed amount advanced to the Trust for this
purpose then equals at least $15,000. When directed by the Depositor or
determined by the Trustee, but in all events as promptly as reasonably
practicable whenever the unreimbursed amount advanced by the Trustee equals or
exceeds $15,000, the Trustee shall sell additional Securities in the manner
provided in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and shall reimburse itself the
amount of the advance, provided that the Trustee's right to reimbursement shall
not be affected by any delay in sale or reimbursement. The Trustee's right to
reimbursement shall be secured by a lien on the Trust prior to the interest of
the Unitholders. The net proceeds of any sale of Securities representing income
shall be credited to the Income Account and then disbursed therefrom for payment
of expenses and payments to Unitholders as otherwise provided in this Indenture.
The balance of such net proceeds shall be credited to the Capital Account. The
Depositor and the Trustee shall use their reasonable efforts to conduct pro rata
sales of Securities qualifying for exception from tax reporting as described in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(G) and, during the final calendar year of
the Trust, qualifying for the exception from tax reporting described in Treas.
Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(F). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Trustee nor the Depositor shall be liable to any person in the event sales
proceeds for any calendar year exceed the general de minimis test of Treas. Reg.

Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(D)(1) (whether or not due to a failure to sell
Securities pro rata) or otherwise require reporting under Treas. Reg. Section
1.671-5.


(32) Section 6.02 is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph:


With respect to any Trust which is a widely held fixed investment trust as
defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(b)(22), the Depositor and the Trustee
agree that the Trust meets the requirements of Treas. Reg. Section
1.671-5(f)(1)(i), and the Trustee is authorized: (i) to report in accordance
with any of the safe harbor methods described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(f);

(ii) to report sales proceeds, whenever permitted, as provided in Treas. Reg.

Section 1.671-5(f)(1)(iv)(B); (iii) to report proceeds of sales and dispositions
described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(D)(4)(ii) as provided in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(D)(4)(i); (iv) if so directed by the
Depositor, to use the measuring date, as defined in Treas. Reg. Section
1.671-5(c)(2)(iv)(D)(1), in lieu of the start-up date; and (v) to use any method
permitted by the Treasury for the purpose of determining the net asset value of
the Trust pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(c)(2)(D)(1), if directed to do
so by the Depositor. For purposes of Treas. Reg. Section
1.671-5(f)(1)(iv)(A)(2), the date of the last deposit under 2.01(b) prior to the
expiration of the initial offering period, as certified to the Trustee by the
Depositor, shall be considered the 'start-up date' of the Trust.


(33) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of the Trust, Section 3.19 is hereby amended by adding the following
paragraph:


In limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of the
Unitholders, the Depositor is authorized to instruct the Trustee to change the
dates on which the deferred sales charge is deducted as described in the
Prospectus. The deferred sales charge payment dates may be delayed: (i) in order
for a Trust which is a widely held fixed investment trust as defined in Treas.
Reg. Section 1.671-5(b)(22) to report in accordance with any of the safe harbor
methods described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.671-5(f); or (ii) in order for a
Trust which is a regulated investment company as defined by the Internal Revenue
Code to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company. The
Trustee shall have no liability for any tax or other liability incurred by
reason of action or inaction resulting from such direction. The Depositor will
amend the Prospectus to include the new dates on which the deferred sales charge
will be collected and distributing such notice to Unitholders.


(34) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust, Section 3.19 shall be amended by adding the following
sentences at the end thereof:


"To the extent permitted by applicable law and regulatory authorization,
unpaid portions of the deferred sales charge shall be secured by a lien on the
Trust in favor of the Depositor, provided that such lien shall be subordinate to
the lien of the Trustee granted by Section 6.04 of the Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust. To the extent of such lien, the Trustee shall hold the
assets of the Trust for the benefit of the Depositor, provided that the Trustee
is authorized to make dispositions, distributions and payments for expenses in
the ordinary course of the administration of the Trust without regard to such
lien."


(35) All reference to Claymore Securities, Inc. in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust shall be replaced with "Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC"


This Reference Trust Agreement shall be deemed effective when executed and
delivered by the Sponsor and the Trustee.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Reference Trust
Agreement to be duly executed.

Re: Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have served as counsel to Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092
(hereinafter referred to as the "Fund"), in connection with the issuance, under
the Reference Trust Agreement dated the date hereof between Guggenheim Funds
Distributors, LLC, as Depositor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, of
Units of fractional undivided interest in the one or more Trusts of said Fund
(hereinafter referred to as the "Units").


In connection therewith, we have examined such pertinent records and
documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary in order to enable us
to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. We have assumed the genuineness
of all agreements, instruments and documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity to originals of all copies thereof submitted to us. We have also
assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all persons
executing agreements, instruments and documents examined or relied upon by us.


We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the
securities to be acquired by the Fund, or other financial or statistical data
contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as to which we
understand you have been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. In addition, we have made no
specific inquiry as to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have
been commenced with respect to the Registration Statement or the Depositor nor
have we reviewed court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to
limitations as to enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization,
moratorium, insolvency and other laws of general application relating to or
affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under
equitable principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.


The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New
York. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1. The Reference Trust Agreement has been duly authorized and executed and
delivered by an authorized officer of the Depositor and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Depositor in accordance with its terms.


2. The establishment of book entry positions evidencing the Units in the
Trust(s) of the Fund have been duly authorized by the Depositor. Upon payment of
the consideration for the Units as provided in the Reference Trust Agreement and
the Registration Statement, the Units will be, when sold, validly issued and
purchasers of the Units will not have any obligation to make payments to the
Fund or its creditors (other than the purchase price for the Units) or
contributions to the Fund or its creditors solely by reason of the purchasers'
ownership of the Units.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-190987) relating to the Units referred to
above and to the use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said
Registration Statement and in the related Prospectus. This opinion is intended
solely for the benefit of the addressee in connection with the issuance of the
Units of the Fund and may not be relied upon in any other manner or by any other
person without our express written consent.

Re: Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092
Strategic Income Portfolio (15-month), Series 72




Ladies/Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC, depositor
of Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1092 (the "Fund"), in connection with
the issuance of units of fractional undivided interest in the Fund (the
"Units"), under a trust agreement dated October 7, 2013 (the "Indenture") among
Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC, as sponsor (the "Sponsor"), as depositor
(the "Depositor") and evaluator (the "Evaluator"), and The Bank of New York
Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Fund is comprised of the following unit
investment trust: Strategic Income Portfolio (15-month), Series 72 (the
"Trust"). This opinion applies only to the Trust. Holders of beneficial
interests in the Trust are referred to herein as the "Unitholders."


In this connection, we have examined the registration statement and the
prospectus for the Fund (the "Prospectus"), the Indenture, and such other
instruments and documents, as we have deemed pertinent (the "Transaction
Documents"). For purposes of this opinion, we are assuming that the Trust will
at all times be operated in accordance with the Indenture and the Prospectus and
that the parties to the Indenture will at all times fully comply with the terms
of the Indenture. Failure to operate the Trust at all times in accordance with
the Indenture and the Prospectus or failure to comply fully at all times with
the terms of the Indenture could result in tax treatment different from that
described below.


You have informed us, and we are assuming, that the assets of the Trust
will consist of a portfolio as set forth in the Prospectus. All of the assets of
the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." You have not requested us to examine,
and accordingly we have not examined, any of the Trust Assets and express no
opinion as to the Federal income or state tax treatment thereof.


The Transaction Documents include certain representations by the Depositor
and the Trustee with respect to which we have no independent knowledge and have
done no independent investigation. Such representations include, without
limitation, that: (i) the Trust will acquire and hold the Trust Assets solely
for the account of the Unitholders; (ii) the activities of the Trust will
consist of the investment of funds in the Trust Assets, the collection of the
income and proceeds from such investments, and the incidental replacement of
Trust Assets and temporary reinvestment of proceeds under limited and specified
circumstances; and (iii) the Trust has not and will not (a) establish an office,

(b) hire employees, or (c) conduct any acts not permitted by the Indenture.


Based upon the foregoing and assuming the accuracy of the aforementioned
representations and assumptions on the date hereof as well as continuing
satisfaction of such representations and assumptions, and based upon an
investigation of such matters of law as we consider to be applicable:


(i) We are of the opinion that, under existing United States Federal
income tax law, the Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
Federal income tax purposes but will be classified as a grantor trust and will
be governed by the provisions of subpart E of Part I of subchapter J (relating
to trusts) of chapter 1, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").


(ii) Section 671 of the Code provides that, where a trust grantor is
treated as the owner of any portion of a trust, there shall then be included in
computing the taxable income and credits of the grantor those items of income,
deductions and credits against tax of the trust which are attributable to that
portion of the trust to the extent that such items would be taken into account
under the Code in computing taxable income or credits against the tax of an
individual. Each Unitholder is treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the
Trust under Section 676 of the Code. Therefore, a Unitholder will be considered
as owning a pro rata share of each of the Trust Assets in the proportion that
the number of Units held by him or her bears to the total number of Units
outstanding. We are of the opinion that, under existing United States Federal
income tax law, (a) under subpart E, subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code,
income of the Trust will be treated as income of each Unitholder in the
proportion described above, and an item of Trust income will have the same
character in the hands of a Unitholder as it would have if the Unitholder
directly owned a pro rata portion of the Trust's assets and (b) each Unitholder
will be considered to have received his or her pro rata share of income derived
from each Trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by the
Unitholder if the Unitholder directly owned a pro rata portion of the Trust's
assets.


(iii) Although the discussion in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxes"
does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units, in our
opinion, under existing United States Federal income tax law, such discussion,
taken as a whole, is an accurate summary in all material respects, to the extent
that the discussion constitutes statements of law or legal conclusions with
respect to United States federal income tax matters. In this regard, please note
that (a) we have not examined any of the Trust Assets and we are therefore
unable to express an opinion, and we express no opinion as to the federal income
tax treatment thereof and (b) the discussion under "Taxes" depends in part on
the facts peculiar to individual Unitholders of which we have made no
investigation and have no knowledge.


(iv) Based solely upon the existing laws of the State of New York and The
City of New York, administrative interpretations thereof and court decisions as
of the date hereof, we are of the opinion that (a) the Trust will not be subject
to the New York State franchise tax imposed on domestic and foreign corporations
by Article 9-A of the New York State Tax Law; (b) the Trust will not have
taxable income subject to the New York State personal income tax imposed by
Article 22 of the New York State Tax Law; (c) the Trust will not be subject to
the unincorporated business tax imposed by Section 11-503 of the Administrative
Code of The City of New York (the "Administrative Code"); (d) the Trust will not
be subject to the general corporation tax imposed by The City of New York on
domestic and foreign corporations under Section 11-603 of the Administrative
Code; and (e) the Trust will not have taxable income subject to the personal
income tax imposed by The City of New York under Section 11-1701 of the
Administrative Code.


Our opinion is based on the Code, the New York State Tax Law, the
Administrative Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant
authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently, future
changes in such laws, the regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant
authorities and law may cause the tax treatment of the transaction to be
materially different from that described above. This opinion is given as of the
date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to advise
you of any change in any matter set forth herein. Our opinion represents only
our legal judgment, is not a guarantee of a result and, unlike a tax ruling, is
binding neither on the Internal Revenue Service, the New York state or city
taxing authorities nor a court of law, and has no official status of any kind.
The Internal Revenue Service, the New York state or city taxing authorities or a
court of law could disagree with the opinion expressed herein. Although we
believe that, in a properly presented case, the opinion expressed herein would
be found to be correct if challenged, there can be no assurance that this will
be the case. In evaluating these tax issues, we have not taken into account the
possibility that a tax return will not be audited, that an issue will not be
raised on audit, or that an issue will be resolved through settlement if raised.


This opinion, as qualified herein, covers only the opinions expressly
contained herein, and we express no opinion with respect to any other
considerations which may arise relating to the transaction, any other taxes or
any other matters arising under United States Federal, state, local or foreign
law.


The Committee on Legal Opinions of the American Bar Association
promulgated the "Third-Party Legal Opinion Report, Including the Legal Opinion
Accord," (the "ABA Guidelines") in 1991. Among other things the ABA Guidelines
provide that attorneys should not provide legal opinions as to matters of fact
or financial or economic forecasts (or similar predictions). In this regard,
matters discussed expressly or implicitly within this letter which are
determined to be matters of fact or financial or economic forecasts (or similar
predictions) should be interpreted to be a confirmation of our understanding and
a statement of our belief rather than a legal opinion, regardless of the
language used.


Chapman and Cutler LLP does not and will not impose any limitation on the
disclosure of tax treatment or tax structure of any transaction relating to this
matter.

Ladies and Gentlemen:


We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and
delivery by you of a certain Reference Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"),
dated as of today's date between Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC, as
Depositor (the "Depositor"), and you, as Trustee, establishing Guggenheim
Defined Portfolios, Series 1092 and STRATEGIC INCOME PORTFOLIO (15-MONTH),
SERIES 72 (the "Trust"), and the execution by you, as Trustee under the Trust
Agreement, of receipts for units evidencing ownership of all of the units of
fractional undivided interest (such receipts for units and such aggregate units
being herein respectively called "Receipts for Units" and "Units") in the Trust,
as set forth in the prospectus (the "Prospectus"), included in the registration
statement on Form S-6, as amended to the date hereof (the "Registration
Statement"), relating to the Trust. The Trust consists of equity and/or debt
securities (the "Securities") (including delivery statements relating to
contracts for the purchase of certain Securities not yet delivered and cash,
cash equivalents or an irrevocable letter or letters of credit, or a combination
thereof, in the amount required to pay for such purchases upon the receipt of
such Securities) as listed under "Portfolio" in the Prospectus (such Securities,
delivery statements and cash, cash equivalents, letter or letters of credit
being herein called the "Portfolio Assets").


We have examined the Trust Agreement, and originals (or copies certified
or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,
certificates and documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of rendering this opinion. In such examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to our opinion, we have,
when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.


Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1. The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws
of the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the Banking
Law of the State of New York.


2. The Trust Agreement is in proper form for execution and delivery by
you, as Trustee, and each has been duly executed and delivered by you, as
Trustee, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Depositor, the Trust Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of The
Bank of New York Mellon.


3. The Receipts for Units are in proper form for execution by you, as
Trustee, and have been duly executed by you, as Trustee, and pursuant to the
Depositor's instructions, the Trustee has registered on the registration books
of the Trusts the ownership of the Units by Cede & Co., as nominee of The
Depository Trust Company where it has caused the Units to be credited to the
account of the Depositor.


In rendering the foregoing opinion we have not considered, among other
things, the merchantability of the Portfolio Assets, whether the Portfolio
Assets have been duly authorized and delivered or the tax status of the
Portfolio Assets under any federal, state or local laws.


The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York
and the federal laws of the United States of America. This opinion is for your
benefit and may not be disclosed to or relied upon by any other person without
our prior written consent.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to
the Registration Statement relating to the Units and to the use of our name and
the reference to our firm in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus.

PROSPECTUS PART A DATED DECEMBER 23, 2014



A portfolio of securities selected

by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC


An investment can be made in the underlying closed-end funds and
exchange-traded fund directly rather than through the trust. These direct
investments can be made without paying the sales charge, operating expenses and
organizational costs of the trust.


The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of
these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.





INVESTMENT SUMMARY



Use this Investment Summary to help you decide whether an investment in
this trust is right for you. More detailed information can be found later in
this prospectus.



Overview



Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1257 is a unit investment trust that
consists of the MLP & Energy Funds Portfolio, Series 8 (the "trust").
Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC ("Guggenheim Funds" or the "sponsor") serves
as the sponsor of the trust.


The trust is scheduled to terminate in approximately 2 years.



Investment Objective



The trust seeks to provide current income with the potential for capital
appreciation.





Principal Investment Strategy



The trust contains three sleeves of security types, all of which focus on
the master limited partnership ("MLP") space. Under normal circumstances, the
trust will invest at least 80% of the value of its assets in a combination of
publicly-traded equity securities of energy MLPs, common shares of closed-end
investment companies ("Closed-End Funds") that invest substantially all of
their assets in MLPs and companies in the energy sector as classified by
Standard & Poor's Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICs"), and shares
of an exchange-traded fund ("ETF") that tracks the Alerian MLP Infrastructure
Index.


The securities in which the Closed-End Funds invest may include, but are
not limited to:


o    MLP common stocks, which may include all market capitalizations;


o    MLP private placements; and


o    Securities issued by MLPs and companies in the energy sector, such as
warrants, convertible bonds, preferred securities, corporate bonds,
senior loans, high-yield or "junk" bonds, or international bonds. The
trust does not have a specific policy as to the maturity of the bonds
held by the Closed-End Funds in the portfolio and such Closed-End
Funds may invest in bonds of all ranges of maturity.


The securities in which the Closed-End Funds invest may include foreign
securities, including securities issued by companies headquartered or
incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets. Please see
"Principal Risks" and "Investment Risks" for information concerning the risks
associated with such securities.


The trust may invest in MLPs of any market capitalization and of companies
headquartered or incorporated in foreign countries.



Security Selection



The sponsor has selected for the portfolio MLPs, Closed-End Funds and an
ETF believed to have the best potential to achieve the trust's investment
objective.


When selecting Closed-End Funds for inclusion in this portfolio, the
sponsor looks at numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited
to:


1)   Investment Objective -- The sponsor favors Closed-End Funds with a
defined investment objective and a history of adherence to those
policies and objectives;


2)   Premium/Discount -- The sponsor favors Closed-End Funds that trade at
a discount to its net asset value and trade at wider discounts than
peers and its own historical average discount;


3)   Consistent Dividend -- The sponsor favors Closed-End Funds that have a
history of paying a regular monthly, quarterly, semi- or annual
distribution;


4)   Performance -- the sponsor favors Closed-End Funds with a solid
history of performance in relation to its benchmarks and peers; and


5)   Liquidity -- The sponsor favors Closed-End Funds with adequate daily
trading liquidity.


When selecting the ETF for inclusion in this portfolio, the sponsor will
seek to include an ETF that tracks the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index.
Currently, this ETF is the Alerian MLP ETF. When selecting the ETF, the sponsor
looks at numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:


1)   Liquidity -- The sponsor favors ETFs with adequate daily trading
liquidity; and


2)   Yield -- The sponsor favors ETFs with market yields consistent with
the investment objective of the trust.


When selecting MLP equities for inclusion in this portfolio, the sponsor
looks at numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:


1)   Overlap with ETF and underlying Closed-End Fund holdings -- The
sponsor seeks to minimize overlap between the MLP selections in
relation to the underlying holdings of the ETF and Closed-End Funds;


2)   Liquidity -- The sponsor favors MLPs with adequate daily trading
liquidity;


3)   Yield -- The sponsor favors MLPs with market yields consistent with
the investment objective of the trust;


4)   Consistent Distribution Growth -- The sponsor favors MLPs with a
history of consistent distribution growth;


5)   Valuations -- The sponsor favors MLPs trading at valuation levels
in-line or lower than peers, as measured by operating earnings to
price; and


6)   Debt Levels -- The sponsor favors MLPs with lower overall debt levels
in relation to earnings.



Exchange-Traded Funds



ETFs are investment pools that hold securities. ETFs provide an efficient
and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity
to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction
throughout the trading day. ETFs are often built like an index fund, but trade
like a stock on an exchange. ETFs generally offer advantages similar to those
found in index funds such as low operating costs, performance designed to track
an index, the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment
strategies. Unlike conventional mutual funds, ETFs normally issue and redeem
shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks
of shares, known as "creation units." Market makers, large investors and
institutions deal in creation units. The trust will buy shares of the ETF on the
exchanges and will incur brokerage costs.



Future Trusts



The sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same investment
strategy. One such trust is expected to be available approximately three months
after the initial date of deposit (the "Inception Date"). If these future
trusts are available, you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a
reduced sales charge. Each trust is designed to be part of a longer term
strategy.

Principal Risks



As with all investments, you may lose some or all of your investment in
the trust. No assurance can be given that the trust's investment objective will
be achieved. The trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can
happen for reasons such as these:


o    Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may
fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various
factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales
of securities by the trust, government policies, litigation, and
changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the
securities' issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the
trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency.


o    The trust and certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust invest in
MLPs. MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies
that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited
partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on
securities exchanges like shares of common stock. Currently, most MLPs
operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors.
Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally
applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors,
including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion
risk and exploration risk.


The benefit the trust derives from its investment in MLPs is largely
dependent on their being treated as partnerships for federal income
tax purposes. As a partnership, an MLP has no income tax liability at
the entity level. If, as a result of a change in an MLP's business, an
MLP were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes,
such MLP would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at
the applicable corporate tax rate. If an MLP was classified as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes, the amount of cash
available for distribution with respect to its units would be reduced
and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed
entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the MLP.
Therefore, treatment of an MLP as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes would result in a material reduction in the after-tax return
to the trust, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of
the units of the trust.


o    The trust is concentrated in the energy sector and certain Closed-End
Funds held by the trust include securities issued by companies in the
energy sector. As a result, the factors that impact the energy sector
will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly
diversified trust. Companies in the energy sector are subject to
volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels, and can be
impacted by international politics and conflicts, including the unrest
in Iraq and hostilities in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, the
success of exploration projects, reduced demand as a result of
increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation, natural
disasters, clean-up and litigation costs associated with environmental
damage and extensive regulation.


o    The trust invests and certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may
invest in securities issued by small-capitalization and
mid-capitalization companies. These securities customarily involve
more investment risk than securities of large-capitalization
companies. Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may
have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be
more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments.


o    The trust includes Closed-End Funds. Closed-End Funds are actively
managed investment companies that invest in various types of
securities. Closed-End Funds issue common shares that are traded on a
securities exchange. Closed-End Funds are subject to various risks,
including management's ability to meet the Closed-End Fund's
investment objective and to manage the Closed-End Fund's portfolio
during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions
regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying investments change.
Closed-End Funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder
and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset
value. Closed-End Funds may also employ the use of leverage which
increases risk and volatility. Instability in the auction rate
preferred shares market may affect the volatility of Closed-End Funds
that use such instruments to provide leverage.


o    The trust includes an ETF. ETFs are investment pools that hold other
securities. ETFs are subject to various risks, including management's
ability to meet the fund's investment objective. Shares of ETFs may
trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary
market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net
asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such
discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time
in response to various factors. The underlying ETF has management and
operating expenses. Consequently, you will bear not only your share of
the trust's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying ETF. By
investing in an ETF, the trust incurs greater expenses than you would
incur if you invested directly in the ETF.


o    The trust is subject to an ETF's index correlation risk. To the extent
that an underlying ETF is an index tracking ETF, index correlation
risk is the risk that the performance of an ETF will vary from the
actual performance of the fund's target index, known as "tracking
error." This can happen due to fund expenses, transaction costs,
market impact, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs) and
timing variances.


o    The ETF and Closed-End Funds are subject to annual fees and expenses,
including a management fee. Unitholders of the trust will bear these
fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust. See "Fees and
Expenses" for additional information.


o    The value of the fixed-income securities in the Closed-End Funds will
generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Typically,
fixed-income securities with longer periods before maturity are more
sensitive to interest rate changes.


o    A Closed-End Fund, ETF or an issuer of securities held by a Closed-End
Fund or ETF may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments
and/or to declare distributions in the future, may call a security
before its stated maturity, or may reduce the level of distributions
declared. This may result in a reduction in the value of your units.


o    The financial condition of a Closed-End Fund, ETF or an issuer of
securities held by a Closed-End Fund or ETF may worsen, resulting in a
reduction in the value of your units. This may occur at any point in
time, including during the primary offering period.


o    Share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may
decline during the life of the trust. There is no guarantee that share
prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the
issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and, if
declared, whether they will remain at current levels or increase over
time.


o    Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from
investments.


o    The sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The trust will
generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to
buy, the same securities even though a security's outlook, market
value or yield may have changed.


See "Investment Risks" in Part A of the prospectus and "Risk Factors" in
Part B of the prospectus for additional information.



Who Should Invest



You should consider this investment if:


o    The trust represents only a portion of your overall investment
portfolio;


o    The trust is part of a longer-term investment strategy that may
include investment in subsequent portfolios, if available; and


o    The trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide
diversification of method to your overall portfolio.


You should not consider this investment if:


o    You are uncomfortable with the trust's investment strategy;


o    You are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in
securities; or


o    You are seeking capital preservation as a primary investment
objective.

                                ===========   ==========








(1)  The initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the
Inception Date. Because the initial sales fee equals the difference between
the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and
the creation and development fee ("C&D Fee") (as described below), the
percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit
price varies and after deferred fees begin. Despite the variability of the
initial sales fee, each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable
maximum sales fee.


(2)  The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.245 per unit and is deducted in
monthly installments of $0.0817 per unit on the last business day of
September 2015 and October 2015 and $0.0816 per unit on the last business
day of November 2015. The percentage provided is based on a $10 per unit
Public Offering Price as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount
will vary over time. If units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee
period, the entire deferred sales fee will be collected.


(3)  The C&D Fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust.
The actual C&D Fee is $0.05 per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the
close of the initial offering period, which is expected to be approximately
three months from the Inception Date. The percentages provided are based on
a $10 unit as of the Inception Date and the percentage amount will vary
over time. If the unit price exceeds $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will be
less than 0.50% of the Public Offering Price; if the unit price is less
than $10.00 per unit, the C&D Fee will exceed 0.50% of the Public Offering
Price. However, in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed 3.95% of a
unitholder's initial investment.


(4)  Based on 100 units with a $10.00 per unit Public Offering Price as of the
Inception Date.


(5)  The estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust
size of approximately $52 million. Because certain of the operating
expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach such estimated size
or falls below the estimated size over its life, the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected. In some cases, the
actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts
reflected. Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and
other transactional fees.


(6)  Although not an actual trust operating expense, the trust, and therefore
the unitholders of the trust, will indirectly bear similar operating
expenses of the Closed-End Funds and ETF held by the trust in the estimated
amount provided above. Estimated Closed-End Fund and ETF expenses are based
upon the net asset value of the number of Closed-End Fund and ETF shares
held by the trust per unit multiplied by the Annual Operating Expenses of
the Closed-End Funds and ETF for the most recent fiscal year. Unitholders
will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying
Closed-End Funds and ETF were held directly. Please note that the sponsor
or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain Closed-End
Funds and ETF held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your
trust to such Closed-End Funds and ETF will be paid to the sponsor or an
affiliate for its services to such Closed-End Funds and ETF.





Example



This example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that you reinvest your
investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge, the
trust's operating expenses do not change and the trust's annual return is 5%.
Your actual returns and expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you
would pay these expenses for every $10,000 you invest:






1 year   $     799
3 years      1,795
5 years      2,784
10 years     5,041








These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment
at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment. The example does
not consider any brokerage fees or transaction fees that broker-dealers may
charge for processing redemption requests.


See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.

(1)  All securities are represented entirely by contracts to purchase
securities, which were entered into by the sponsor on December 22, 2014.
All contracts for securities are expected to be settled by the initial
settlement date for the purchase of units.


(2)  Valuation of securities by the trustee was performed as of the Evaluation
Time on December 22, 2014. For securities quoted on a national exchange,
including the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., securities are generally valued at
the closing sales price using the market value per share. For foreign
securities traded on a foreign exchange, securities are generally valued at
the closing sale prices on the applicable exchange converted into U.S.
dollars. The trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to
security prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for
identical securities.


(3)  There was a $0 loss to the sponsor on the Inception Date.


The following footnotes only apply when noted.


(4)  Non-income producing security.

UNDERSTANDING YOUR INVESTMENT







How to Buy Units



You can buy units of your trust on any business day by contacting your
financial professional. Public offering prices of units are available daily on
the Internet at www.guggenheiminvestments.com. The unit price includes:


o    the value of the securities,


o    organization costs,


o    the maximum sales fee (which includes an initial sales fee, if
applicable, a deferred sales fee and the creation and development
fee), and


o    cash and other net assets in the portfolio.


We often refer to the purchase price of units as the "offer price" or the
"Public Offering Price." We must receive your order to buy units prior to the
close of the New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) to give
you the price for that day. If we receive your order after this time, you will
receive the price computed on the next business day.


Value of the Securities. The sponsor serves as the evaluator of the trust
(the "evaluator"). We cause the trustee to determine the value of the
securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on each day that the
exchange is open (the "Evaluation Time").


Pricing the Securities. The value of securities is generally determined by
using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign
securities exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. In some cases we will price a
security based on the last asked or bid price in the over-the-counter market or
by using other recognized pricing methods. We will only do this if a security is
not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the
NASDAQ Stock Market, or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.


If applicable, the trustee or its designee will value foreign securities
traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their
market prices if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.


The trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in
"Trust Portfolio" for your trust in this prospectus. Such prices were
determined as described above at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on
the business day before the date of this prospectus. On the first day we sell
units we will compute the unit price as of the close of the New York Stock
Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission becomes effective, if later.


Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of your
purchase price includes a per unit amount sufficient to reimburse us for some
or all of the costs of creating your trust. These costs include the costs of
preparing the registration statement and legal documents, legal fees, federal
and state registration fees, the portfolio consulting fee, if applicable, and
the initial fees and expenses of the trustee. Your trust will sell securities
to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or
after six months, at the discretion of the sponsor. Organization costs will not
exceed the estimate set forth under "Fees and Expenses."


Transactional Sales Fee. You pay a fee when you buy units. We refer to this
fee as the "transactional sales fee." The transactional sales fee has both an
initial and a deferred component and is 3.45% of the Public Offering Price,
based on a $10 unit. This percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is
based on the unit price on the Inception Date. Because the transactional sales
fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the C&D Fee, the
percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
unit price varies.


The transactional sales fee does not include the C&D Fee which is
described under "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus and in
"Fees and Expenses" in Part A of the prospectus.


Initial Sales Fee. Based on a $10 unit, the initial sales fee is initially
1% of the Public Offering Price. The initial sales fee, which you will pay at
the time of purchase, is equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee
(3.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the maximum remaining
deferred sales fees and the C&D Fee (initially $0.295 per unit). The dollar
amount and percentage amount of the initial sales fee will vary over time.


Deferred Sales Fee. We defer payment of the rest of the transactional
sales fee through the deferred sales fee ($0.245 per unit). You pay any
remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem units. The trust may sell
securities to meet the trust's obligations with respect to the deferred sales
fee. Thus, no assurance can be given that the trust will retain its present
size and composition for any length of time.


In limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of
unitholders, the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales fee from
the dates listed under "Fees and Expenses."


Reducing Your Sales Fee. We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
maximum sales fee you pay. It is your financial professional's responsibility to
alert us of any discount when you order units. Since the deferred sales fee and
the C&D Fee are a fixed dollar amount per unit, your trust must charge the
deferred sales fee and the C&D Fee per unit regardless of any discounts.
However, when you purchase units of the trust, if you are eligible to receive a
discount such that your total maximum sales fee is less than the fixed dollar
amount of the deferred sales fee and the C&D Fee, the sponsor will credit you
the difference between your maximum sales fee and the sum of the deferred sales
fee and the C&D Fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional
units.


Large Purchases. You can reduce your maximum sales fee by increasing the
size of your investment.


Investors who make large purchases are entitled to the following sales
charge reductions:








                      Sales Charge
                    Reductions (as a
                    % of the Public
Purchase Amount     Offering Price)
------------------------------------
Less than $50,000          0.00%
$50,000 - $99,999          0.25
$100,000 - $249,999        0.50
$250,000 - $499,999        0.75
$500,000 - $999,999        1.00
$1,000,000 or more         1.50








Aggregate unit purchases of any Guggenheim Funds trust by the same person
on any single day from any one broker-dealer qualify for a purchase level. You
can include these purchases as your own for purposes of this aggregation:


o    purchases by your spouse or children under the age of 21 living in the
same household, and


o    purchases by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.


The discounts described above apply only during the initial offering
period.


There can be no assurance that the sponsor will create future trusts with
investment strategies similar to your trust or that may fit within your
investment parameters.


Advisory and Fee Accounts. We eliminate your transactional sales fee for
purchases made through registered investment advisers, certified financial
planners or registered broker-dealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of
commissions or who charge for financial planning or for investment advisory or
asset management services or provide these services as part of an investment
account where a comprehensive "wrap fee" is imposed (a "Fee Account").


This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the
secondary market. Your financial professional may purchase units with the Fee
Account CUSIP numbers to facilitate purchases under this discount, however, we
do not require that you buy units with these CUSIP numbers to qualify for the
discount. If you purchase units with these special CUSIP numbers, you should be
aware that you may have the distributions automatically reinvest into
additional units of your trust or receive cash distributions. We reserve the
right to limit or deny purchases of units not subject to the transactional
sales fee by investors whose frequent trading activity we determine to be
detrimental to your trust. We, as sponsor, will receive and you will pay the
C&D Fee. See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.


Exchange or Rollover Option. If you are buying units of the trust in the
primary market with redemption or termination proceeds from any unit trust, you
may purchase units at 99% of the maximum Public Offering Price, which may
include an up-front sales fee and a deferred sales fee. To qualify for this
sales charge reduction, the termination or redemption proceeds being used to
purchase units of the trust must be no more than 30 days old. Such purchases
entitled to this sales charge reduction may be classified as "Rollover
Purchases." An exchange or rollover is generally treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes. See "Taxes" in Part B of the prospectus.


Rollover Purchases are also subject to the C&D Fee. See "Expenses of the
Trust" in Part B of the prospectus.


Employees. We do not charge the portion of the transactional sales fee
that we would normally pay to your financial professional for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees and their family members (spouses, children
under the age of 21 living in the same household and parents) of Guggenheim
Funds and its affiliates, or by employees of selling firms and their family
members (spouses, children under the age of 21 living in the same household and
parents). You pay only the portion of the fee that the sponsor retains. Such
purchases are also subject to the C&D Fee. This discount applies during the
initial offering period and in the secondary market. Only those broker-dealers
that allow their employees to participate in employee discount programs will be
eligible for this discount.


Dividend Reinvestment Plan. We do not charge any transactional sales fee
when you reinvest distributions from your trust into additional units of the
trust. Since the deferred sales fee is a fixed dollar amount per unit, your
trust must charge the deferred sales fee per unit regardless of this discount.
If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan, we will credit you with
additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover the amount of any
remaining deferred sales fee that will be collected on such units at the time of
reinvestment. The dollar value of these units will fluctuate over time. This
discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.


See "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the
prospectus for more information regarding buying units.


How We Distribute Units. We sell units to the public through
broker-dealers and other firms. We pay part of the sales fee you pay to these
distribution firms when they sell units. The distribution fee paid for a given
transaction is as follows:








                        Concession
                       per Unit (as a
Purchase Amount/      % of the Public
Form of Purchase      Offering Price)
-------------------------------------
Less than $50,000           3.10%
$50,000 - $99,999           2.85
$100,000 - $249,999         2.60
$250,000 - $499,999         2.35
$500,000 - $999,999         2.25
$1,000,000 or more          1.80
Rollover Purchases          2.20
Fee Account and
   Employee Purchases       0.00








We apply these amounts as a percent of the unit price per transaction at
the time of the transaction.


Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain Guggenheim Funds
unit trusts are eligible to receive additional compensation for volume sales.
Such payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to dealer
firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus. The additional
payments will be as follows:








Primary Offering             Additional
Period Sales During            Volume
Calendar Quarter             Concession
---------------------------------------
$0 but less than $10 million    0.000%
$10 million but
  less than $25 million         0.075
$25 million but
  less than $50 million         0.100
$50 million or more             0.125








Eligible unit trusts include all Guggenheim Funds unit trusts sold in the
primary market. Redemptions of units during the primary offering period will
reduce the amount of units used to calculate the volume concessions. In
addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units
which are not subject to a transactional sales fee. However, such sales will be
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for
volume concessions.


Guggenheim Funds reserves the right to modify or terminate the volume
concession program at any time. The sponsor may also pay to certain dealers an
administrative fee for information or service used in connection with the
distribution of trust units. Such amounts will be in addition to any
concessions received for the sale of units.


In addition to the concessions described above, the sponsor may pay
additional compensation out of its own assets to broker-dealers that meet
certain sales targets and that have agreed to provide services relating to the
trust to their customers.


Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker-Dealers. The sponsor, at its own
expense and out of its own profits, may provide additional compensation and
benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this trust and other
Guggenheim Funds products. This compensation is intended to result in additional
sales of Guggenheim Funds products and/or compensate broker-dealers and
financial advisors for past sales. A number of factors are considered in
determining whether to pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include,
but are not limited to, the level or type of services provided by the
intermediary, the level or expected level of sales of Guggenheim Funds products
by the intermediary or its agents, the placing of Guggenheim Funds products on a
preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary's personnel,
and other factors.


The sponsor makes these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisers, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an
intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in
broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the
sponsor's products. The sponsor may make such payments to many intermediaries
that sell Guggenheim Funds products. The sponsor may also make certain payments
to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred
for the purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing
trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.


Payments of such additional compensation, some of which may be
characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an incentive for financial
intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend a Guggenheim Funds
product, including the trust, over products offered by other sponsors or fund
companies. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your
units.


We generally register units for sale in various states in the United
States. We do not register units for sale in any foreign country. It is your
financial professional's responsibility to make sure that units are registered
or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy
units in another country. This prospectus does not constitute an offer of units
in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully. We may
reject any order for units in whole or in part.


We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices. The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them. We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units. For example, we lost the amount set forth in "Trust Portfolio" on
the initial deposit of securities into the trust.


See "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the
prospectus for additional information.



How to Sell Your Units



You can sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial
professional or, in some cases, the trustee. Unit prices are available daily on
the Internet at www.guggenheiminvestments.com or through your financial
professional. We often refer to the sale price of units as the "liquidation
price." You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem your
units. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit
redemptions or sale requests.


Until the end of the initial offering period or six months after the
Inception Date, at the discretion of the sponsor, the price at which the trustee
will redeem units and the price at which the sponsor may repurchase units
include estimated organization costs. After such period, the amount paid will
not include such estimated organization costs.


Selling Units. We do not intend to but may maintain a secondary market for
units. This means that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the
current price which is based on their net asset value. We may then resell the
units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the
redemption price. Our secondary market repurchase price is generally the same
as the redemption price. Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a secondary
market in units. You should contact your financial professional for current
unit prices to determine the best price available. We may discontinue our
secondary market at any time without notice. Even if we do not make a market,
you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for
the current price.


Redeeming Units. You may also be able to redeem your units directly with
the trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock
Exchange is open. The trustee must receive your completed redemption request
prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange for you to receive the unit
price for a particular day. (For what constitutes a completed redemption
request, see "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units--Redemption" in Part B
of the prospectus.) If your request is received after that time or is
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next price computed after the
trustee receives your completed request. Rather than contacting the trustee
directly, your financial professional may also be able to redeem your units by
using the Investors' Voluntary Redemptions and Sales (IVORS) automated
redemption service offered through Depository Trust Company.


If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment
for your units no later than three business days after it receives all
necessary documentation. At the sponsor's discretion, certain redemptions may
be made by an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units in
lieu of cash.


You can generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities
underlying your units if you own units worth at least $25,000 or you originally
paid at least that amount for your units. This option is generally available
only for securities traded and held in the United States and is not available
within 30 business days of the trust's termination. We may modify or
discontinue this option at any time without notice. If you request an in-kind
distribution of the securities underlying units of your trust, you will incur
any distribution or service fees (Rule 12b-1 fees) applicable to those
securities.


Exchange Option. You may be able to exchange your units for units of other
Guggenheim Funds unit trusts at a reduced sales fee. You can contact your
financial professional or Guggenheim Funds for more information about trusts
currently available for exchanges. Before you exchange units, you should read
the prospectus carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then
discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your
investment goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss
tax consequences. To qualify for a reduced sales fee, you may need to meet
certain criteria. We may discontinue this option at any time.


For more complete information regarding selling or redeeming your units,
see "Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units" in Part B of the prospectus.



Distributions



Dividends. Your trust generally pays dividends from its net investment
income, if any, along with any excess capital on each distribution date to
unitholders of record on the preceding record date. You can elect to:


o    reinvest distributions in additional units of your trust at no fee, or


o    receive distributions in cash.


You may change your election by contacting your financial professional or
the trustee. Once you elect to participate in a reinvestment program, the
trustee will automatically reinvest your distributions into additional units at
their net asset value three business days prior to the distribution date. We
waive the sales fee for reinvestments into units of your trust. We cannot
guarantee that units will always be available for reinvestment. If units are
unavailable, you will receive cash distributions. We may discontinue these
options at any time without notice.


In some cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an
excessive amount of principal pending distribution. For example, this could
happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose
security is in your portfolio. In addition, your trust may pay a special
distribution in order to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated
investment company or to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable
year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise tax on undistributed
income in the trust. The amount of your distributions will vary from time to
time as companies change their dividends, trust expenses change or as a result
of changes in the trust's portfolio.


Reinvest in Your Trust. You can keep your money working by electing to
reinvest your distributions in additional units of your trust. The easiest way
to do this is to have your financial professional purchase units with one of
the Reinvestment CUSIP numbers listed in the "Investment Summary" section of
this prospectus. You may also make or change your election by contacting your
financial professional or the trustee. This reinvestment option may be subject
to availability or limitation by the broker-dealer or selling firm. In certain
circumstances, broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a
reinvestment option at any time.


Reports. The trustee will send your financial professional a statement
showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution. Each
year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust's activity
and certain tax information. You can request copies of security evaluations to
enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your
trust, if available.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.






Investment Risks



All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that
can impact the value of the securities in your trust. You should understand
these risks before you invest. You could lose some or all of your investment in
the trust. Recently, equity markets have experienced significant volatility. If
the value of the securities falls, the value of your units will also fall. We
cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your
investment return will be positive over any period.


Market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security in the
trust, the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value. Market
value may be affected by a variety of factors including:


o    General securities markets movements;


o    Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector;


o    Changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector;


o    Interest rates and inflation;


o    Governmental policies and litigation; and


o    Purchases and sales of securities by the trust.


Even though we carefully supervise the portfolio, you should remember that
we do not manage the portfolio. Your trust will not sell a security solely
because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.


Master Limited Partnership risk. The trust and certain Closed End Funds
held by the trust invest in MLPs. MLPs are limited partnerships or limited
liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited
partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities
exchanges like shares of common stock. An MLP consists of a general partner and
limited partners. The general partner manages the partnership, has an ownership
stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution.
The limited partners provide capital to the partnership, have a limited (if any)
role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash
distributions. The trust's investment in securities of MLPs, which are required
to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be
subject to entity level taxation, often offer a yield advantage over other types
of securities. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or
real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks
generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors,
including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and
exploration risk. There are certain tax risks associated with MLPs, including
the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the trust's treatment for
federal income tax purposes of the MLPs in which the trust invests. These tax
risks, and any adverse determination with respect thereto, could have a negative
impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs and/or the
value of the trust's investments.


The benefit the trust derives from its investment in MLPs is largely
dependent on their being treated as partnerships for federal income tax
purposes. As a partnership, an MLP has no income tax liability at the entity
level. If, as a result of a change in an MLP's business, an MLP were treated as
a corporation for federal income tax purposes, such MLP would be obligated to
pay federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate. If
an MLP was classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the
amount of cash available for distribution with respect to its units would be
reduced and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed
entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the MLP. Therefore,
treatment of an MLP as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would
result in a material reduction in the after-tax return to the trust, likely
causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units of the trust.


Energy sector risk. The trust is concentrated in the energy sector and
certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust include securities issued by
companies in the energy sector. As a result, the factors that impact the energy
sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly
diversified trust. Some of the risks associated with the energy sector are
listed below. Companies in the energy sector include, but are not limited to,
companies that explore for, produce, refine, distribute or sell petroleum, gas
products or consumable fuels, or provide parts or services to petroleum, gas or
consumable fuel companies. Companies in this sector are subject to volatile
fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by
international politics, including the unrest in Iraq and hostilities in the
Middle East, terrorist attacks, reduced demand as a result of increases in
energy efficiency and energy conservation, the success of exploration projects,
clean-up and litigation costs relating to oil spills and environmental damage,
and tax and other regulatory policies of various governments. Natural disasters
such as the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico will also impact companies in the
energy sector. Oil production and refining companies are subject to extensive
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air
emissions and the disposal of hazardous materials. In addition, declines in
U.S. and Russian crude oil production will likely lead to a greater world
dependence on oil from OPEC nations which may result in more volatile oil
prices.


Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization company risk. The trust
includes and certain Closed-End Funds held by the trust may include securities
issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. These
securities customarily involve more investment risk than large-capitalization
companies. These additional risks are due in part to the following factors.
Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may:


o    Have limited product lines, markets or financial resources;


o    Be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new
and/or emerging technologies. These technologies may be slow to
develop or fail to develop altogether;


o    Have less publicly available information;


o    Lack management depth or experience;


o    Be less liquid;


o    Be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments;
and


o    Be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key
personnel.


Closed-End Fund risk. The trust invests in Closed-End Funds. Closed-End
Funds are subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet the
Closed-End Fund's investment objective, and to manage the Closed-End Fund's
portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions
regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying investments change.


Shares of Closed-End Funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of Closed-End Fund shares may decrease. The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.


Certain Closed-End Funds included in your trust may employ the use of
leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock. While
leverage often serves to increase the yield of a Closed-End Fund, this leverage
also subjects the Closed-End Fund to increased risks, including the likelihood
of increased volatility and the possibility that the Closed-End Fund's common
share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the
interest rate on any borrowings rises. Instability in the auction rate
preferred shares market may affect the volatility of Closed-End Funds that use
such instruments to provide leverage. In addition, Closed-End Funds are subject
to their own annual fees and expenses, including a management fee. Such fees
reduce the potential benefits associated with owning a Closed-End Fund and are
in addition to your trust's expenses.


Exchange-traded funds risk. The trust invests in shares of an ETF, which
are investment pools that hold other securities. ETFs are usually
passively-managed index funds that seek to replicate the performance or
composition of a recognized securities index. ETFs are either open-end
management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Unlike mutual funds or unit
investment trusts, ETFs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares
at net asset value. ETFs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks, often
referred to as "creation units," however, the sponsor does not intend to sell or
redeem ETFs in this manner. Shares of ETFs are listed on securities exchanges
for trading, which allows investors to purchase and sell individual ETF shares
at current market prices throughout the day. The trust will purchase and sell
ETF shares on these securities exchanges. ETFs therefore possess characteristics
of traditional open-end mutual funds and unit investment trusts, which issue
redeemable shares, and of corporate common stocks or closed-end funds, which
generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges
and are not redeemable.


ETFs are subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet
the fund's investment objective. The trust is also subject to the risks to
which the underlying ETFs may be subject, as well as management and operating
expenses. You will bear not only your share of your trust's expenses, but also
the expenses of the ETFs. By investing in the ETFs, the trust incurs greater
expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the ETFs. Shares of
ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary
market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset
value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such discount from net
asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various
factors.


Index correlation risk. Index correlation risk is the risk that the
performance of the index-tracking ETF will vary from the actual performance of
the fund's target index, known as "tracking error." This can happen due to fund
expenses, transaction costs, market impact, corporate actions (such as mergers
and spin-offs) and timing variances. Some ETFs use a technique called
"representative sampling," which means that the ETF invests in a representative
sample of securities in its target index rather than all of the index
securities. The use of representative sampling could increase the risk of a
tracking error.


Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of
securities held by a Closed-End Fund or ETF in your trust will decline in value
because of a rise in interest rates. Generally, securities that pay fixed rates
of return will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in
value when interest rates rise. Typically, securities that pay fixed rates of
return with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate
changes.


Credit and dividend payment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer
of a security held by the trust or a Closed-End Fund or ETF in your trust is
unable or unwilling to make dividend and/or principal payments. High-yield or
"junk" securities that are rated below investment-grade are generally more
susceptible to this risk than investment-grade securities.


Call risk. Call risk is the risk that securities held by a Closed-End Fund
or ETF in your trust can be prepaid or "called" by the issuer before their
stated maturity. If securities are called, your income will decline and you may
not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. Also, an
early call at par of a security trading at a premium will reduce your return.
Securities held by a Closed-End Fund or ETF in your trust are more likely to be
called when interest rates decline. This would result in early returns of
principal to the Closed-End Funds or ETF in your trust. The securities may also
be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and "mandatory put"
features that may cause the securities to be removed from a fund prior to
maturity or stated call dates. High-yield or "junk" securities that are rated
below investment-grade are generally more susceptible to this risk than
investment-grade securities.


Security quality risk. Security quality risk is the risk that a reduction
in a security's rating may decrease its value, the value of a Closed-End Fund
and the value of your investment in your trust. Securities ratings may be
reduced at any time, including during the primary offering period of your
trust.


Split-ratings risk. Split-rated securities are those securities that, at
the time of investment, are rated below investment-grade by one rating agency,
so long as at least one other rating agency rates such securities within the
four highest grades (i.e., investment-grade quality). This means that a
split-rated security may be regarded by one rating agency as having
predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity
to pay interest and repay principal, and accordingly subject to a greater risk
of default. The prices of split-rated securities, in the view of one but not
all rating agencies, may be more sensitive than securities without a
split-rating to negative developments, such as a decline in the issuer's
revenues or a general economic downturn.


PFIC risk. Your trust may invest in companies that are considered to be
PFICs. In general, PFICs are certain non-U.S. corporations that receive at least
75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest,
dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least
50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income. As a result of
an investment in PFICs, your trust could be subject to U.S. federal income tax
and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect
to those securities, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its
unitholders. Your trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any
credit or deduction for such taxes. Your trust may be able to make an election
that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences. In this case, your trust
would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such PFIC
shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not
exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, your trust might
be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and
such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and
would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax. Dividends paid by
PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend income.


Litigation and legislation risk. Your trust is also subject to litigation
and legislation risk. From time to time, various legislative initiatives are
proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the companies represented in the trust. In addition, litigation
regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the sectors represented by
these issuers, may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively
impact the share prices of these securities. We cannot predict what impact any
pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the
share prices of the securities.


Inflation risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or
income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the
value of money.


Significant unitholders risk. There may be unitholders of the trust who
hold a significant portion of the trust and, as result, a redemption by such
significant holder may have a material impact on the size, expenses and
viability of the trust.


See "Risk Factors" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.



How the Trust Works



Your Trust. Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. We created the
trust under a trust agreement between Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC (as
sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).
To create your trust, we deposited contracts to purchase securities with the
trustee along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay
for the securities. In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to
us. Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.
These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.


Changing Your Portfolio. Your trust is not a managed fund. Unlike a
managed fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed after its
inception. Your trust will generally buy and sell securities:


o    to pay expenses,


o    to issue additional units or redeem units,


o    in limited circumstances to protect the trust,


o    to avoid direct or indirect ownership of a passive foreign investment
company,


o    to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the
trust,


o    to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment
company, or


o    as permitted by the trust agreement.


You will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in your
trust. As the holder of the securities, the trustee will vote the securities and
will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as
closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are
the securities held by owners other than your trust. However, the trustee may
not be able to vote the securities in your trust that are traded on foreign
exchanges.


In the event that an issuer of any of the securities in the trust offers
to issue new securities, or to exchange securities for trust securities, the
trustee will, at the direction of the sponsor, accept or reject such offer or
vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in
exchange for a trust security. Should any issuance, exchange or substitution
take place, any securities, cash or property received will be deposited and
promptly sold by the trustee pursuant to the sponsor's direction, unless the
sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or property.


Only the trustee may vote the shares of the Closed-End Funds held in your
trust. The trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as the
shares held by other shareholders of each Closed-End Fund.


We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units. When we create
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio. In certain
cases, the trustee may need additional time to acquire the securities necessary
to create units and consequently, the trust may not be fully invested at all
times, which may impact the trust's performance. When your trust buys
securities, it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees. You could
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities. When your trust buys or sells securities, we may direct that it
place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or
are affiliated with your trust. We will not select firms to handle these
transactions on the basis of their sale of units of the trust. We cannot
guarantee that the trust will keep its present size and composition for any
length of time.


Termination of Your Trust. Your trust will terminate no later than the
termination date listed in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus.
The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less
than $1 million or less than 40% of the value of the securities in the trust at
the end of the initial offering period. At this size, the expenses of your
trust may create an undue burden on your investment. Investors owning
two-thirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust
early. We may also terminate your trust in other limited circumstances.


The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining
securities. The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting
final expenses. Your termination distribution may be less than the price you
originally paid for your units.

additional information.



General Information



Guggenheim Funds. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC specializes in the
creation, development and distribution of investment solutions for advisors and
their valued clients. In November 2001, we changed our name from Ranson &
Associates, Inc. to Claymore Securities, Inc. ("Claymore"). On September 27,
2010, Claymore officially changed its name to Guggenheim Funds Distributors,

LLC. This change follows the acquisition of Claymore by Guggenheim Partners,
LLC on October 14, 2009. Since the finalization of the acquisition, we have
been operating as a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC.


During our history we have been active in public and corporate finance,
have underwritten closed-end funds and have distributed bonds, mutual funds,
closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, structured products and unit trusts in
the primary and secondary markets. We are a registered broker-dealer and member
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). If we fail to or cannot
perform our duties as sponsor or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us,
continue to operate your trust without a sponsor, or terminate your trust. You
can contact us at our headquarters at 2455 Corporate West Drive, Lisle,
Illinois 60532 or by using the contacts listed on the back cover of this
prospectus. Guggenheim Funds personnel may from time to time maintain a
position in certain securities held by your trust.


Guggenheim Funds and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Guggenheim Funds' employees who have access to information on trust
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the
code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your trust.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.


The Trustee. The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust. It
is a trust company organized under New York law. You can contact the trustee by
calling the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or write to
Unit Investment Trust Division, 2 Hanson Place, 12th Fl., Brooklyn, New York
11217. We may remove and replace the trustee in some cases without your
consent. The trustee may also resign by notifying the sponsor and investors.


See "Administration of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for
additional information.






Expenses



Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations. The
"Investment Summary" section of this prospectus shows the estimated amount of
these expenses.


Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services. The trustee
also benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing
accounts. Your trust will reimburse the sponsor as supervisor and evaluator for
providing portfolio supervisory services, evaluating your portfolio and
performing bookkeeping and administrative services. Our reimbursements may
exceed the costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed
the costs of services provided to all Guggenheim Funds unit investment trusts
in any calendar year. In addition, the trustee may reimburse the sponsor out of
its own assets for services performed by employees of the sponsor in connection
with the operation of your trust. All of these fees may adjust for inflation
without your approval.


Your trust will pay a fee to the sponsor for creating and developing the
trust, including determining the trust objective, policies, composition and
size, selecting service providers and information services, and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. Your trust pays this
"creation and development fee" of $0.05 per unit from the assets of the trust
as of the close of the initial public offering period. The sponsor does not use
the fee to pay distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.


Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses, including any
licensing fees. Your trust may pay expenses such as trustee expenses (including
legal and auditing expenses), organization expenses, various governmental
charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of taking action to
protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and Guggenheim Funds,
legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs incurred
to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions. Your trust
may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year. The trustee
may sell securities to pay trust expenses.


Your trust, and therefore the unitholders of your trust, will also
indirectly bear the expenses of the underlying Closed-End Funds and ETF. While
your trust will not pay these expenses directly out of its assets, these
expenses are shown under "Annual Fund Operating Expenses of the Trust" in the
"Fees and Expenses" section of this prospectus to illustrate the impact of
these expenses. Please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as
a service provider to certain Closed-End Funds or ETF held by your trust and
therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such Closed-End Funds or ETF will
be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such Closed-End
Funds or ETF.


See "Expenses of the Trust" in Part B of the prospectus for additional
information.

Unitholders

Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1257


We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition,
including the trust portfolio set forth on page 10 and 11 of this prospectus,
of Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, Series 1257, as of December 23, 2014, the
initial date of deposit. This statement of financial condition is the
responsibility of the trust's sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.
We were not engaged to perform an audit of the trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of
credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of
financial condition as of December 23, 2014. We believe that our audit of the
statement of financial condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above
presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Guggenheim
Defined Portfolios, Series 1257, as of December 23, 2014, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

-----------------








(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price
evaluations as determined by the trustee.


(2)  A letter of credit has been deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon,
trustee, covering the funds (aggregating $149,750) necessary for the
purchase of the securities in the trust, represented by purchase contracts.


(3)  A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to
pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the trust.
These costs have been estimated at $8.00 per 100 units of the trust. A
distribution will be made as of the close of the initial offering period or
six months after the initial date of deposit (at the discretion of the
sponsor) to an account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation
of the investors will be satisfied. Organization costs will not be assessed
to units that are redeemed prior to the close of the initial offering
period or six months after the initial date of deposit (at the discretion
of the sponsor). To the extent that actual organization costs are greater
than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to
the Public Offering Price will be deducted from the assets of the trust.


(4)  The aggregate cost to unitholders includes a maximum sales fee, which
consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee and a creation and
development fee. The initial sales fee is equal to the difference between
the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and
the creation and development fee. On the Inception Date, the maximum sales
fee is 3.95% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.99% of the net
amount invested). The deferred sales fee is equal to $0.245 per unit.


(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable transactional sales
fee assuming no reduction of transactional sales fees for quantity
purchases.


(6)  The trust is committed to pay a creation and development fee of $5.00 per
100 units at the close of the initial public offering period. The creation
and development fee will not be assessed to units that are redeemed prior
to the close of the initial offering period.

General Information



Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Guggenheim Defined Portfolios and registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. Each trust was
created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus
under the laws of the state of New York. Each trust was created under a trust
agreement among Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC (as sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).


When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of
units of the trust. After your trust is created, the sponsor may deposit
additional securities in the trust, contracts to purchase additional securities
along with cash (or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash) to pay for such
contracted securities or cash (including a letter of credit) with instructions
to purchase additional securities. Such additional deposits will be in amounts
which will seek to replicate, as closely as practicable, the portfolio
immediately prior to such deposits. If the sponsor deposits cash, existing and
new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the
securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the
securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees.


A trust consists of (i) the securities listed under "Trust Portfolio" in
the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust; (ii)
any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the
provisions of the trust agreement; and (iii) any cash held in the accounts of
the trust. Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for
any failure in any of the securities. However, should any contract for the
purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the
sponsor will, unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover
such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the
trust agreement, refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed
contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date.







Investment Policies



The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed"
fund. Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic,
financial and market analysis. The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer
will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.


Unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities
in a trust. As the holder of the securities, the trustee will vote the
securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities
are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general
proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust. However,
the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded
on foreign exchanges.


The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may (but need not) direct
the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer
having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations, the
issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code, or the price of a security has declined to such an
extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the sponsor
the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust. If a public
tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or
accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or
tender is in the best interest of unitholders. The trustee will distribute any
cash proceeds to unitholders. Pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited
exceptions, the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in
exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or
other transaction. If offered such new or exchanged securities or property
other than cash, the trustee shall reject the offer. However, in the event such
securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust, they may be
accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a
trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor. Proceeds from the sale of
securities (or any securities or other property received by the trust in
exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital Account for distribution
to unitholders or to meet redemptions.


Except as stated in the trust agreement, or in the prospectus, the
acquisition by the trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities
is prohibited. The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from
the trust for the purpose of redeeming units of a trust tendered for redemption
and the payment of expenses and for such other purposes as permitted under the
trust agreement.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the trustee is authorized to reinvest any
funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts, pending distribution, in U.S.
Treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution
date. Any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds
therefrom may not be reinvested.


Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.
Except for failed securities and as provided in the prospectus or in the trust
agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the
portfolio securities is prohibited. The trustee may sell securities from a
trust for limited purposes, including redeeming units tendered for redemption
and the payment of expenses.






Risk Factors



Stocks. An investment in units of a trust should be made with an
understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities,
including the risk that the financial condition of issuers of the securities may
become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may worsen
(both of which may contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the
securities and thus, in the value of the units) or the risk that holders of
common stock have a right to receive payments from the issuers of those stocks
that is generally inferior to that of creditors of, or holders of debt
obligations issued by, the issuers and that the rights of holders of common
stock generally rank inferior to the rights of holders of preferred stock. You
could lose some or all of your investment in the trust. Common stocks are
especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile
increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of the
issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or
regional political, economic or banking crises.


Holders of common stock incur more risk than the holders of preferred
stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the
entity, have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in
comparison with the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or
preferred stock issued by the issuer. Holders of common stock of the type held
by a trust have a right to receive dividends only when and if, and in the
amounts, declared by the issuer's board of directors and to participate in
amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on
the issuer have been paid or provided for. By contrast, holders of preferred
stock have the right to receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared
by the issuer's board of directors, normally on a cumulative basis, but do not
participate in other amounts available for distribution by the issuing
corporation. Cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common
stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to
future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock.
Preferred stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to
those of common stocks. Moreover, common stocks do not represent an obligation
of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the
degree of protection of capital debt securities. Indeed, the issuance of debt
securities or even preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of
principal, interest, liquidation preferences and dividends which could
adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay
dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with
respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. Further, unlike
debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at
maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market fluctuations prior
thereto), common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity
and have values which are subject to market fluctuations for as long as the
stocks remain outstanding. The value of the securities in a portfolio thus may
be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of a trust to values higher or
lower than those prevailing at the time of purchase.


The sponsor's buying and selling of the securities, especially during the
initial offering of units of the trust or to satisfy redemptions of units may
impact upon the value of the underlying securities and the units. The
publication of the list of the securities selected for the trust may also cause
increased buying activity in certain of the stocks comprising the portfolio.
After such announcement, investment advisory and brokerage clients of the
sponsor and its affiliates may purchase individual securities appearing on the
list during the course of the initial offering period or may purchase warrants
issued by the sponsor or its affiliates which are based on the performance of
the securities on the list. The sponsor or its affiliates may also purchase
securities as a hedge against its risk on the warrants (although generally the
sponsor and its affiliates will not purchase securities for their own account
until after the trust portfolio has been acquired). Such buying activity in the
stock of these companies or issuance of the warrants prior to the purchase of
the securities by the trust may cause the trust to purchase stocks at a higher
price than those buyers who effect purchases by the trust.


Fixed Portfolio. Investors should be aware that the trust is not "managed"
and as a result, the adverse financial condition of a company will not result in
the elimination of its securities from the portfolio of the trust except under
extraordinary circumstances. Investors should note in particular that the
securities were selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in the
prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities
originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the
attractiveness of the securities may have changed. A number of the securities in
the trust may also be owned by other clients of the sponsor. However, because
these clients may have differing investment objectives, the sponsor may sell
certain securities from those accounts in instances where a sale by the trust
would be impermissible, such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market
fluctuations. In the event a public tender offer is made for a security or a
merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security, the sponsor may
instruct the trustee to tender or sell the security on the open market when, in
its opinion, it is in the best interest of the unitholders of the unit to do so.
Although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and the sponsor may
instruct the trustee to sell securities under certain limited circumstances,
securities will not be sold by the trust to take advantage of market
fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation. As a result, the
amount realized upon the sale of the securities may not be the highest price
attained by an individual security during the life of the trust. The prices of
single shares of each of the securities in the trust vary widely, and the effect
of a dollar of fluctuation, either higher or lower, in stock prices will be much
greater as a percentage of the lower-price stocks' purchase price than as a
percentage of the higher-price stocks' purchase price.


Closed-End Fund Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust
may invest in the common stock of closed-end funds ("Closed-End Funds").
Closed-End Funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in
various types of securities. Closed-End Funds issue shares of common stock that
are traded on a securities exchange. Closed-End Funds are subject to various
risks, including management's ability to meet the Closed-End Fund's investment
objective, and to manage the Closed-End Fund portfolio when the underlying
securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding Closed-End Funds or their underlying
investments change.


Shares of Closed-End Funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of Closed-End Fund shares may decrease. The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.


Certain of the Closed-End Funds included in a trust may employ the use of
leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock. While
leverage often serves to increase the yield of a Closed-End Fund, this leverage
also subjects the Closed-End Fund to increased risks, including the likelihood
of increased volatility and the possibility that the Closed-End Fund's common
share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the
interest rate on any borrowings rises.


Exchange-Traded Fund Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust may invest in the common stock of exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"). ETFs are
investment pools that hold other securities. ETFs are either open-end management
investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. Unlike typical open-end funds or unit investment trusts,
ETFs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value.
In addition, securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading, which allows
investors to purchase and sell individual ETF shares at current market prices
throughout the day. ETFs therefore possess characteristics of traditional
open-end funds and unit investment trusts, which issue redeemable shares, and of
corporate common stocks or closed-end funds, which generally issue shares that
trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable. ETFs
are subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet the fund's
investment objective. The underlying ETF has management and operating expenses.
You will bear not only your share of the trust's expenses, but also the expenses
of the underlying ETF. By investing in an ETF, the trust incurs greater expenses
than you would incur if you invested directly in the ETF.


Shares of ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the
secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net
asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such discount from
net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various
factors.


Market Discounts or Premiums. Certain of the securities may have been
deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their dividend
rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities. The
current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated
securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in
market value as they approach maturity. The current returns of market premium
securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because
premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity.
Because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments
and not at maturity, an early redemption at par of a premium security will
result in a reduction in yield to the trust. Market premium or discount
attributable to dividend rate changes does not indicate market confidence or
lack of confidence in the issue.


Liquidity. Whether or not the securities are listed on a national
securities exchange, the principal trading market for the securities may be in
the over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading
market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in
the securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of
the securities, that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the
liquidity of the securities in any markets made. In addition, a trust is
restricted under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from selling securities to
the sponsor. The price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions
and the value of a trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the
securities are limited or absent.


Additional Deposits. The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit) with instructions
to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the issuance of a
corresponding number of additional units. If the sponsor deposits cash,
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of
the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the
securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees. To
minimize this effect, the trusts will attempt to purchase the securities as
close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible.


Some of the securities may have limited trading volume. The trustee, with
directions from the sponsor, will endeavor to purchase securities with deposited
cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those securities
over the 20 business days following each deposit in an effort to reduce the
effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks. This could,
however, result in the trusts' failure to participate in any appreciation of
those stocks before the cash is invested. If any cash remains at the end of this
period (and such date is within the 90-day period following the inception date)
and cannot be invested in one or more stocks, at what the sponsor considers
reasonable prices, it intends to use that cash to purchase each of the other
securities in the original proportionate relationship among those securities.
Similarly, at termination of the trust, the sponsor reserves the right to sell
securities over a period of up to nine business days to lessen the impact of its
sales on the market price of the securities. The proceeds received by
unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales
proceeds received on the securities, which will likely differ from the closing
sale price on the termination date.


Litigation and Legislation. At any time litigation may be initiated on a
variety of grounds, or legislation may be enacted with respect to the
securities in a trust or the issuers of the securities. There can be no
assurance that future litigation or legislation will not have a material
adverse effect on the trust or will not impair the ability of issuers to
achieve their business goals.


Financial Sector Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, certain
of the issuers of securities in a trust may be involved in the financial
sector. An investment in units of a trust containing securities of such issuers
should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the
financial sector in general.


Banks, thrifts and their holding companies are especially subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets, in commercial and residential real estate
loans or any particular segment or industry; and competition from new entrants
in their fields of business. Banks and thrifts are highly dependent on net
interest margin. Banks and thrifts traditionally receive a significant portion
of their revenues from consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in
mortgage and refinance markets.


Banks, thrifts and their holding companies are subject to extensive
federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state
regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and
limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks and
thrifts may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of
discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and
may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular
institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such
institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory
actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to
banks and thrifts and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be
paid by banks and thrifts to the FDIC, can negatively impact earnings and the
ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits
nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of
banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in
the securities issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of
banks, thrifts and their holding companies have increased significantly and
have undergone substantial change in the recent past.


The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") require the expanded use of market value accounting by
banks and have imposed rules requiring mark-to-market accounting for investment
securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of
additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health
of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems.
Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"
changed the requirements of mark-to-market accounting and determining fair value
when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has
significantly decreased. These changes and other potential changes in financial
accounting rules and valuation techniques may have a significant impact on the
banking and financial services industries in terms of accurately pricing assets
or liabilities. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be
forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed
substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws,
rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any,
that such changes would have on the securities in a trust's portfolio. In
addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress
and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that system could, among other
things, further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks
or change the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor. On
October 3, 2008, EESA increased the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance
coverage payable as to any certificate of deposit from $100,000 to $250,000 per
depositor. The impact of this reform is unknown and could reduce profitability
as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited
and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. The sponsor
makes no prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank and thrift regulatory
actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might
have on a trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act") generally
prohibits a bank holding company from (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a
bank or bank holding company; (ii) acquiring control of a bank or another bank
holding company; (iii) acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank;
or (iv) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, without
first obtaining FRB approval. In considering an application with respect to any
such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of
banks or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies in which the FRB expressed its view that a bank holding
company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which
exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken
its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose limitations
on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain
applications, including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions.
The sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have
on the securities in a trust or whether such approvals, if necessary, will be
obtained.


Companies engaged in investment banking/brokerage and investment management
include brokerage firms, broker/dealers, investment banks, finance companies and
mutual fund companies. Earnings and share prices of companies in this industry
are quite volatile, and often exceed the volatility levels of the market as a
whole. Negative economic events in the credit markets have led some firms to
declare bankruptcy, forced short-notice sales to competing firms, or required
government intervention by the FDIC or through an infusions of Troubled Asset
Relief Program funds. Consolidation in the industry and the volatility in the
stock market have negatively impacted investors.


Additionally, government intervention has required many financial
institutions to become bank holding companies under the BHC Act. Under the
system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the FRB
supervises bank holding companies as an umbrella regulator. The BHC Act and
regulations generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business
activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related
activities. The FRB and FDIC have also issued substantial risk-based and
leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. The
guidelines define a three-tier framework, requiring depository institutions to
maintain certain leverage ratios depending on the type of assets held. If any
depository institution controlled by a financial or bank holding company ceases
to meet capital or management standards, the FRB may impose corrective capital
and/or managerial requirements on the company and place limitations on its
ability to conduct broader financial activities. Furthermore, proposed
legislation will allow the Treasury and the FDIC to create a resolution regime
to "take over" bank and financial holding companies. The "taking over" would be
based on whether the firm is in default or in danger of defaulting and whether
such a default would have a serious adverse effect on the financial system or
the economy. This mechanism would only be used by the government in exceptional
circumstances to mitigate these effects. This type of intervention has unknown
risks and costs associated with it, which may cause unforeseeable harm in the
industry.


Companies involved in the insurance industry are engaged in underwriting,
reinsuring, selling, distributing or placing of property and casualty, life or
health insurance. Other growth areas within the insurance industry include
brokerage, reciprocals, claims processors and multi-line insurance companies.
Interest rate levels, general economic conditions and price and marketing
competition affect insurance company profits. Property and casualty insurance
profits may also be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters. Life
and health insurance profits may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates.
Individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve
inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations, and profitability. In
addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies continue to shrink
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital
expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance industry are subject to significant risk factors, including those
applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as: (i) the inherent
uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability loss reserves,
particularly reserves for the cost of environmental, asbestos and mass tort
claims, and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established
loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of
operations and financial condition; (ii) the fact that insurance companies have
experienced, and can be expected in the future to experience, catastrophe losses
which could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition, results
of operations and cash flow; (iii) the inherent uncertainty in the process of
establishing property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claims settlement practices; (iv) the need for insurance
companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory
capital and surplus, particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating
organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to
maintain acceptable financial strength or claims-paying ability rating; (v) the
extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies' subsidiaries
are subject, various regulatory initiatives that may affect insurance companies,
and regulatory and other legal actions; (vi) the adverse impact that increases
in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance company's investment
portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products; (vii) the need
to adjust the effective duration of the assets and liabilities of life insurance
operations in order to meet the anticipated cash flow requirements of its
policyholder obligations; and (viii) the uncertainty involved in estimating the
availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.
This enhanced oversight into the insurance industry may pose unknown risks to
the sector as a whole.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation.
The sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Environmental pollution clean-up is the subject of both federal and state
regulation. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites
subject to clean up. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation
regarding coverage issues. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes
("mini-Superfund") govern the cleanup and restoration by "Potentially
Responsible Parties" ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds ("Environmental
Clean-up Laws" or "ECLs") establish a mechanism to pay for clean-up of waste
sites if PRPs fail to do so, and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of
liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. The
extent of clean-up necessary and the assignment of liability has not been fully
established. The insurance industry is disputing many such claims. Key coverage
issues include whether Superfund response costs are considered damages under the
policies, when and how coverage is triggered, applicability of pollution
exclusions, the potential for joint and several liability and definition of an
occurrence. Similar coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not
covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings
on these issues. An insurer's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds
which have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. Superfund reform
proposals have been introduced in Congress, but none have been enacted. There
can be no assurance that any Superfund reform legislation will be enacted or
that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient
system for settlement of Superfund related claims.


While current federal income tax law permits the tax-deferred accumulation
of earnings on the premiums paid by an annuity owner and holders of certain
savings-oriented life insurance products, no assurance can be given that future
tax law will continue to allow such tax deferrals. If such deferrals were not
allowed, consumer demand for the affected products would be substantially
reduced. In addition, proposals to lower the federal income tax rates through a
form of flat tax or otherwise could have, if enacted, a negative impact on the
demand for such products.


Major determinants of future earnings of companies in the financial
services sector are the direction of the stock market, investor confidence,
equity transaction volume, the level and direction of long-term and short-term
interest rates, and the outlook for emerging markets. Negative trends in any of
these earnings determinants could have a serious adverse effect on the
financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities
included in the trust will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in
the rapidly developing marketplace. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressures to compete globally.


Foreign Securities Risk. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in foreign issuers,
and therefore, an investment in such a trust involves some investment risks
that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust that invests
entirely in securities of domestic issuers. Those investment risks include
future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the
payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, exchange control policies, and the limited
liquidity and small market capitalization of such foreign countries' securities
markets. In addition, for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there may be less publicly
available information than is available from a domestic issuer. Also, foreign
issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting, auditing and
financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those
applicable to domestic issuers. However, due to the nature of the issuers of
the securities included in the trust, the sponsor believes that adequate
information will be available to allow the sponsor to provide portfolio
surveillance.


Certain of the securities in the trust may be in ADR or GDR form. ADRs,
American Depositary Receipts and GDRs, Global Depositary Receipts, represent
common stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary. American Depositary
Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts (collectively, the "Depositary
Receipts") are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of
underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. These instruments may
not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into
which they may be converted. For purposes of the discussion herein, the terms
ADR and GDR generally include American Depositary Shares and Global Depositary
Shares, respectively.


Depositary Receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored. In an unsponsored
facility, the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of
market makers and acts as agent for the Depositary Receipts holder, while the
company itself is not involved in the transaction. In a sponsored facility, the
issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative
and shareholder-related expenses. Sponsored facilities use a single depositary
and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer, the shareholder and
the depositary; unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no
contractual relationship to the company. The depositary bank that issues
Depositary Receipts generally charges a fee, based on the price of the
Depositary Receipts, upon issuance and cancellation of the Depositary Receipts.
This fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the
acquisition or surrender of the security. In addition, the depositary bank
incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash
distributions paid in local currency into U.S. dollars and such expenses are
deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders,
resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the Depositary
Receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly.
Certain tax considerations, including tax rate differentials and withholding
requirements, arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to
nationals of another and from certain practices in the Depositary Receipts
market may also exist with respect to certain Depositary Receipts. In varying
degrees, any or all of these factors may affect the value of the Depositary
Receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market.
In addition, the rights of holders of Depositary Receipts may be different than
those of holders of the underlying shares, and the market for Depositary
Receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares. Depositary
Receipts are registered securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and
may be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.


For the securities that are Depositary Receipts, currency fluctuations
will affect the United States dollar equivalent of the local currency price of
the underlying domestic share and, as a result, are likely to affect the value
of the Depositary Receipts and consequently the value of the securities. The
foreign issuers of securities that are Depositary Receipts may pay dividends in
foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars. Most foreign
currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the United States dollar for
many reasons, including supply and demand of the respective currency, the
soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as
compared to the economies of the United States and other countries. Therefore,
for any securities of issuers (whether or not they are in Depositary Receipt
form) whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies, or which pay dividends
in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies, there is a
risk that their United States dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the
United States dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies.


Preferred Stock Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust,
or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in preferred stock. If this
is the case, an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the
risks which an investment in preferred stocks entails, including the risk that
the financial condition of the issuers of the securities or the general
condition of the preferred stock market may worsen, and the value of the
preferred stocks and therefore the value of the units may decline. Preferred
stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile
increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the
issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable factors, including
expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, market
liquidity, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises.
Preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the
dividends-received deduction which would adversely affect the after-tax return
to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction. Such a reduction might
adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general. Holders of preferred
stocks, as owners of the entity, have rights to receive payments from the
issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or, in some cases, other senior
preferred stocks of, such issuers. Preferred stocks do not represent an
obligation of the issuer and, therefore, do not offer any assurance of income or
provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities. The
issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create
prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which
could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or
pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock
with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. The value
of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the
preferred stocks remain outstanding, and thus the value of the securities may be
expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than
those prevailing on the initial date of deposit.


Trust Preferred Securities Risks. If set forth in Part A of the
prospectus, a trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in
trust preferred securities. Holders of trust preferred securities incur risks
in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding
preferred stocks. Trust preferred securities are limited-life preferred
securities that are typically issued by corporations, generally in the form of
interest-bearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations, or by an
affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in the form of beneficial
interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation, or similarly
structured securities. The maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred
securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures. Trust
preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may
be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments
for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of
certain circumstances at any time. Trust preferred securities generally have a
yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks, but unlike preferred stocks,
distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as
interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes. Unlike most
preferred stocks, distributions received from trust preferred securities are
generally not eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Certain of the
risks unique to trust preferred securities include: (i) distributions on trust
preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the
interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures are
made; (ii) a corporation issuing the interest-bearing notes, preferred
securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these
instruments for up to 20 consecutive quarters and if such election is made,
distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the
deferral period; (iii) certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the
redemption of the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated
debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust
preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date; (iv) future
legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from
deducting its interest payments on the interest-bearing notes, preferred
securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes, making redemption of
these instruments likely; (v) a corporation may redeem the interest-bearing
notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or
in part from time to time on or after a stated call date; (vi) trust preferred
securities holders have very limited voting rights; and (vii) payment of
interest on the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated
debentures, and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities, is
dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation.


Convertible Securities Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in convertible
securities.


Convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields
than non-convertible fixed-income securities of similar credit quality because
of the potential for capital appreciation. The market values of convertible
securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to
increase as interest rates decline. However, a convertible security's market
value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing
company, particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible
security's conversion price. The conversion price is defined as the
predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be
converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock. As the market price of
the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price, the price of
the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield
of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common
stock. Thus, it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying
common stock, and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain
or loss than common stocks. However, mandatory convertible securities (as
discussed below) generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same
extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder. In the event of a
liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities would be
paid before that company's common stockholders. Consequently, an issuer's
convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock.
However, convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer
in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are
typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations. In addition,
contingent payment, convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions
based on its nonconvertible cost of debt, which generally will result in
deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities (and
accordingly, holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash
payments received).


Mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of
convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the
conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the
underlying common stock, which may be significantly less than par or the price
(above or below par) paid. For these reasons, the risks associated with
investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks
inherent in common stocks. Mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a
higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price
volatility and loss upon conversion. Because the market price of a mandatory
convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its
underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion
date, there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the
potential loss.


Senior Loan Risks. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a trust, or
issuers of securities held by a trust, may invest in senior loans.


Senior loans in which a Closed-End Fund or an ETF may invest:


o    generally are of below investment-grade or "junk" credit quality;


o    may be unrated at the time of investment;


o    generally are not registered with the SEC or any state securities
commission; and


o    generally are not listed on any securities exchange.


The amount of public information available on senior loans generally will
be less extensive than that available for other types of assets.


No reliable, active trading market currently exists for many senior loans,
although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the
past several years. Senior loans are thus relatively illiquid. Liquidity
relates to the ability of a Closed-End Fund or an ETF to sell an investment in
a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the Closed-End
Fund's or the ETF's books. The illiquidity of senior loans may impair a
Closed-End Fund's or an ETF's ability to realize the full value of its assets
in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets. Because
of the lack of an active trading market, illiquid securities are also difficult
to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the
true value of the securities. However, many senior loans are of a large
principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions. To
the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans, the
market may be subject to irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and
extended trade settlement periods. The market for senior loans could be
disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or
decrease in interest rates. This could result in increased volatility in the
market and in the trusts' net asset value.


If legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional
requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions, the availability of
senior loans for investment by the Closed-End Funds or the ETFs may be
adversely affected. In addition, such requirements or restrictions could reduce
or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers. This would increase
the risk of default. If legislation or federal or state regulators require
financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly
leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory
scrutiny, financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans. Such
sales could result in depressed prices. If a Closed-End Fund or an ETF attempts
to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in
such a sale, the price a Closed-End Fund or an ETF could get for the senior
loan may be adversely affected.


Some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the senior loans
to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other
action detrimental to lenders. Such court action could under certain
circumstances include invalidation of senior loans. Any lender, which could
include a Closed-End Fund or an ETF, is subject to the risk that a court could
find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the
common laws of tort or contracts or anti-fraud provisions of certain securities
laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant
terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the
collateral underlying the senior loan.


Floating-Rate Securities Risk. If set forth in Part A of the prospectus, a
trust, or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in floating-rate
securities. Certain Closed-End Funds or ETFs held by the trust may invest in
securities that are structured as floating-rate instruments in which the
interest rate payable on the obligations fluctuates on a periodic basis based
upon changes in a base lending rate. As a result, the yield on these securities
will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the
Closed-End Funds or the ETFs to experience a reduction in the income they
receive from these securities. A sudden and significant increase in market
interest rates may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a decline in
the value of these investments and the value of the Closed-End Funds or the ETFs
held by the trust.


Small-Capitalization and Mid-Capitalization Stocks Risk. If set forth in
Part A of the prospectus, a trust may invest in small-capitalization or
mid-capitalization stocks. Investing in small-capitalization stocks or
mid-capitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in
large-capitalization stocks, since they can be subject to more abrupt or
erratic price movements. Many small market capitalization companies ("Small-Cap
Companies") or middle market capitalization companies ("Mid-Cap Companies")
will have had their securities publicly traded, if at all, for only a short
period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable
trading pattern through economic cycles. The price volatility of Small-Cap
Companies and Mid-Cap Companies is relatively higher than larger, older and
more mature companies. The greater price volatility of Small-Cap Companies and
Mid-Cap Companies may result from the fact that there may be less market
liquidity, less information publicly available or fewer investors who monitor
the activities of these companies. In addition, the market prices of these
securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general
economic conditions. Some Small-Cap Companies or Mid-Cap Companies will not
have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to
demonstrate whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or
inflationary periods. Further, a variety of factors may affect the success of a
company's business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or
compensate for them, including domestic and international political
developments, government trade and fiscal policies, patterns of trade and war
or other military conflict which may affect industries or markets or the
economy generally.



Administration of the Trust



Distributions to Unitholders. Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account of the trust. Other receipts are credited to
the Capital Account of a trust. Income received by a trust will be distributed
on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in the prospectus on
a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown
in the prospectus. However, if set forth in Part A of the prospectus that the
trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis ("Income Averaging"), then
income received by the trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of
one-twelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing 12
months. All distributions will be net of applicable expenses. There is no
assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends
received may be used to pay expenses. In addition, excess amounts from the
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to
the unitholders then of record. Proceeds received from the disposition of any
of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution
date will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next
distribution date applicable to the Capital Account. The trustee shall be
required to make a distribution from the Capital Account if the cash balance on
deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at
least $1.00 per 100 units. The trustee is not required to pay interest on funds
held in the Capital or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon
and therefore benefits from the use of such funds). The trustee is authorized
to reinvest any funds held in the Capital or Income Accounts, pending
distribution, in U.S. Treasury obligations which mature on or before the next
applicable distribution date. Any obligations so acquired must be held until
they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested.


The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an
amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders' pro rata share
of the dividend distributions then held in the Income Account after deducting
estimated expenses. Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant
rate throughout the year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to
fluctuate. However, if the trust uses Income Averaging, the trust prorates the
income distribution on an annual basis and annual income distributions are
expected to vary from year to year. If the amount on deposit in the Income
Account is insufficient for payment of the amount of income to be distributed
on a monthly basis, the trustee shall advance out of its own funds and cause to
be deposited in and credited to such Income Account such amount as may be
required to permit payment of the monthly income distribution. The trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the trust, without interest, out of
income received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance and subject
to the condition that any such reimbursement shall be made only if it will not
reduce the funds in or available for the Income Account to an amount less than
required for the next ensuing distribution. Persons who purchase units will
commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner.
A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a unitholder of record, on
the date of settlement provided payment has been received. Notification to the
trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser, but in
the normal course of business such notice is provided by the selling
broker-dealer.


The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account
of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of a trust. The trustee also
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trust's assets until
such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the
appropriate accounts. In addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and
Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover
redemptions of units.


Distribution Reinvestment. Unitholders may elect to have distributions of
capital (including capital gains) or dividends, if any, or both automatically
invested into additional units of their trust without a sales fee.


Your trust will pay any deferred sales fee per unit regardless of any
sales fee discounts. However, if you elect to have distributions on your units
reinvested into additional units of your trust, you will be credited the amount
of any remaining deferred sales charge on such additional units at the time of
reinvestment.


Unitholders who are receiving distributions in cash may elect to
participate in distribution reinvestment by filing with the Program Agent an
election to have such distributions reinvested without charge. Such election
must be received by the Program Agent at least ten days prior to the record
date applicable to any distribution in order to be in effect for such record
date. Any such election shall remain in effect until a subsequent notice is
received by the Program Agent.


The Program Agent is The Bank of New York Mellon. All inquiries concerning
participating in distribution reinvestment should be directed to The Bank of
New York Mellon at its Unit Investment Trust Division office.


Statements to Unitholders. With each distribution, the trustee will
furnish to each registered holder a statement of the amount of income and the
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in
each case as a dollar amount per unit.


The accounts of a trust will not be audited annually unless the sponsor
determines that such an audit would be in the best interest of the unitholders
of the trust. If an audit is conducted, it will be done at the related trust's
expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor. The
accountants' report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon
written request. Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each
calendar year, the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during
the calendar year was a unitholder of a trust a statement, covering the
calendar year, generally setting forth for the trust:


(A)  As to the Income Account:


(1)  Income received;


(2)  Deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the trust
and for redemptions of units, if any; and


(3)  The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; and


(B)  As to the Capital Account:


(1)  The dates of disposition of any securities and the net proceeds
received therefrom;


(2)  Deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of
the trust; and


(3)  The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions
expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last
business day of such calendar year; and


(C)  The following information:


(1)  A list of the securities as of the last business day of such calendar
year;


(2)  The number of units outstanding on the last business day of such
calendar year;


(3)  The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during such
calendar year; and


(4)  The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from the
Income and Capital Accounts separately stated, expressed both as total
dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit outstanding on the
record dates for each such distribution.


Rights of Unitholders. A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption. The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to
claim an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for
partition or winding up of a trust. No unitholder shall have the right to
control the operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote
with respect to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a
trust.


Amendment and Termination. The trust agreement may be amended by the
trustee and the sponsor without the consent of any of the unitholders: (i) to
cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision which may be
defective or inconsistent; (ii) to change any provision thereof as may be
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any successor
governmental agency; (iii) to make such provisions as shall not materially
adversely affect the interests of the unitholders; or (iv) to make such other
amendments as may be necessary for a trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company, in the case of a trust which has elected to qualify as such. The trust
agreement with respect to any trust may also be amended in any respect by the
sponsor and the trustee, or any of the provisions thereof may be waived, with
the consent of the holders of units representing 66 2/3% of the units then
outstanding of the trust, provided that no such amendment or waiver will reduce
the interest of any unitholder thereof without the consent of such unitholder
or reduce the percentage of units required to consent to any such amendment or
waiver without the consent of all unitholders of the trust. In no event shall
the trust agreement be amended to increase the number of units of a trust
issuable thereunder, to permit the acquisition of any securities in addition to
or in substitution for those initially deposited in the trust or to adversely
affect the characterization of a trust as a regulated investment company for
federal income tax purposes, except in accordance with the provisions of the
trust agreement. The trustee shall promptly notify unitholders of the substance
of any such amendment.


The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination
date set forth in Part A of the prospectus. If the value of a trust shall be
less than the applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus, the trustee
may, in its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate
the trust. A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units
representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding. In addition, the
sponsor may terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index
is no longer maintained.


Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the mandatory
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection
with the termination of the trust. The sponsor may assist the trustee in these
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.


The trustee will attempt to sell the securities as quickly as it can during
the termination proceedings without, in its judgment, materially adversely
affecting the market price of the securities, but it is expected that all of the
securities will in any event be disposed of within a reasonable time after a
trust's termination. The sponsor does not anticipate that the period will be
longer than one month, and it could be as short as one day, depending on the
liquidity of the securities being sold. The liquidity of any security depends on
the daily trading volume of the security and the amount that the sponsor has
available for sale on any particular day. Of course, no assurances can be given
that the market value of the securities will not be adversely affected during
the termination proceedings.


Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata
share of the balances remaining in the Income and Capital Accounts of the
trust.


The sponsor currently intends, but is not obligated, to offer for sale
units of a subsequent series of certain trusts at approximately one year after
the inception date of such trusts. If the sponsor does offer such units for
sale, unitholders may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a
public offering price which includes a reduced sales fee. There is, however, no
assurance that units of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at
that time, or if offered, that there will be sufficient units available for
sale to meet the requests of any or all unitholders.


The Trustee. The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its Unit
Investment Trust Division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Fl., Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone 1-800-701-8178. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust. In accordance with the trust
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units
held by, every unitholder of a trust. Such books and records shall be open to
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business
hours. The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation. The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a
current list of the securities held in each trust. Pursuant to the trust
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.


Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor. The trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before the date specified
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within thirty days after notification, the retiring
trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor. The sponsor may at any time remove the trustee, with or without
cause, and appoint a successor trustee as provided in the trust agreement.
Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each unitholder by the
sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such
successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the
original trustee shall vest in the successor. The trustee must be a corporation
organized under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, be
authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers and have at all times an
aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $5,000,000.


The Sponsor. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC specializes in the
creation, development and distribution of investment solutions for advisors and
their valued clients. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC was created as Ranson
& Associates, Inc. in 1995 and is the successor sponsor to unit investment
trusts formerly sponsored by EVEREN Unit Investment Trusts, a service of EVEREN
Securities, Inc. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC is also the sponsor and
successor sponsor of Series of Ranson Unit Investment Trusts and The Kansas
Tax-Exempt Trust and Multi-State Series of The Ranson Municipal Trust. On
October 29, 2001, Ranson & Associates, Inc. was acquired by Claymore Group LLC.
The sale to Claymore Group LLC was financed by a loan from The Bank of New York
Mellon, the trustee. In November 2001, the sponsor changed its name from Ranson
& Associates, Inc. to Claymore Securities, Inc. On October 14, 2009, Guggenheim
Partners, LLC acquired Claymore Securities, Inc. Since the finalization of the
acquisition, Claymore Securities, Inc. has been operating as a subsidiary of
Guggenheim Partners, LLC. On September 27, 2010, Claymore Securities, Inc.
officially changed its name to Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC.


Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC has been active in public and corporate
finance, has underwritten closed-end funds and has sold bonds, mutual funds,
closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, structured products and unit
investment trusts and maintained secondary market activities relating thereto.
At present, Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC which is a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), is the sponsor to each of the
above-named unit investment trusts. The sponsor's offices are located at 2455
Corporate West Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532.


If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public
authorities, then the trustee may (i) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission; (ii) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as
provided therein; or (iii) continue to act as trustee without terminating the
trust agreement.


The Supervisor and the Evaluator. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC, the
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor. The evaluator and supervisor
may resign or be removed by the trustee in which event the trustee is to use
its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor. Such resignation or
removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor
evaluator. If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has accepted
appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the evaluator may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.
Notice of such registration or removal and appointment shall be mailed by the
trustee to each unitholder. As evaluator, Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC
utilizes the trustee to perform certain evaluation services.


Limitations on Liability. The sponsor is liable for the performance of its
obligations arising from its responsibilities under the trust agreement, but
will be under no liability to the unitholders for taking any action or
refraining from any action in good faith pursuant to the trust agreement or for
errors in judgment, except in cases of its own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its duties thereunder. The
sponsor shall not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale of any securities.


The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities. In the event
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable
for any such action taken by it in good faith. The trustee shall not be
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or
in respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof. In addition, the
trust agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of
the trustee.


The unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the evaluator and
shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. The trust agreement
provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made in good
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided,
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its
obligations under the trust agreement.






Expenses of the Trust



The sponsor does not charge a trust an annual advisory fee. The sponsor
will receive a portion of the sale commissions paid in connection with the
purchase of units and will share in profits, if any, related to the deposit of
securities in the trust. The sponsor and/or its affiliates do, also, receive an
annual fee as set forth in Part A of the prospectus for maintaining
surveillance over the portfolio and for performing certain administrative
services for the trust (the "Sponsor's Supervisory Fee"). In providing such
supervisory services, the sponsor may purchase research from a variety of
sources, which may include dealers of the trusts. If so provided in Part A of
the prospectus, the sponsor may also receive an annual fee for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services for a trust (the "Bookkeeping and
Administrative Fee"). Such services may include, but are not limited to, the
preparation of various materials for unitholders and providing account
information to the unitholders. If so provided in Part A of the prospectus, the
evaluator may also receive an annual fee for performing evaluation services for
the trusts (the "Evaluator's Fee"). In addition, if so provided in Part A of
the prospectus, a trust may be charged an annual licensing fee to cover
licenses for the use of service marks, trademarks, trade names and intellectual
property rights and/or for the use of databases and research. The trust will
bear all operating expenses. Estimated annual trust operating expenses are as
set forth in Part A of the prospectus; if actual expenses are higher than the
estimate, the excess will be borne by the trust. The estimated expenses include
listing fees but do not include the brokerage commissions and other
transactional fees payable by the trust in purchasing and selling securities.


The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in Part A of the
prospectus. The trustee's fee, which is paid monthly, is based on the largest
number of units of a trust outstanding at any time during the primary offering
period. After the primary offering period, the fee shall accrue daily and be
based on the number of units outstanding on the first business day of each
calendar year in which the fee is calculated or the number of units outstanding
at the end of the primary offering period, as appropriate. The Sponsor's
Supervisory Fee, the Bookkeeping and Administrative Fee and the Evaluator's Fee
are paid monthly and are based on the largest number of units of a trust
outstanding at any time during the primary offering period. After the primary
offering period, these fees shall accrue daily and be based on the number of
units outstanding on the first business day of each calendar year in which a
fee is calculated or the number of units outstanding at the end of the primary
offering period, as appropriate. The trustee benefits to the extent there are
funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in the
Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing and
the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee. Part of the
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from
the use of these funds. In addition, the Sponsor's Supervisory Fee, Bookkeeping
and Administrative Fee, Evaluator's Fee and the Trustee's Fee may be adjusted
in accordance with the cumulative percentage increase of the United States
Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent"
since the establishment of the trust. In addition, with respect to any fees
payable to the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor for providing bookkeeping
and other administrative services, supervisory services and evaluation
services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such
services for a trust, but at no time will the total amount received for such
services, in the aggregate, rendered to all unit investment trusts of which
Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC is the sponsor in any calendar year exceed
the actual cost to the sponsor or its affiliates of supplying such services, in
the aggregate, in such year. In addition, the trustee may reimburse the sponsor
out of its own assets for services performed by employees of the sponsor in
connection with the operation of your trust.


The trust will also pay a fee to the sponsor for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust objective, policies, composition and
size, selecting service providers and information services, and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. Your trust pays this
"creation and development fee" as a fixed dollar amount at the close of the
initial offering period. The sponsor does not use the fee to pay distribution
expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: (i)
fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (ii) expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses, but not including any fees and expenses
charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of securities) and of counsel,
if any; (iii) various governmental charges; (iv) expenses and costs of any
action taken by the trustee to protect the trust or the rights and interests of
the unitholders; (v) indemnification of the trustee for any loss, liability or
expense incurred by it in the administration of the trust not resulting from
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part; (vi)
indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred in
acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful
malfeasance or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust
agreement; (vii) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial
offering period; and (viii) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon
termination of the trust. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out
of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the trust.
Since the securities are all stocks, and the income stream produced by dividend
payments, if any, is unpredictable, the sponsor cannot provide any assurance
that dividends will be sufficient to meet any or all expenses of a trust. If the
balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to provide for
amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell securities to
pay such amounts. These sales may result in capital gains or losses to
unitholders. It is expected that the income stream produced by dividend payments
may be insufficient to meet the expenses of a trust and, accordingly, it is
expected that securities will be sold to pay all of the fees and expenses of the
trust.


The trust shall also bear the expenses associated with updating the
trust's registration statement and maintaining registration or qualification of
the units and/or a trust under federal or state securities laws subsequent to
initial registration. Such expenses shall include legal fees, accounting fees,
typesetting fees, electronic filing expenses and regulatory filing fees. The
expenses associated with updating registration statements have been
historically paid by a unit investment trust's sponsor.






Portfolio Transactions and Brokerage Allocation



When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the
securities in the trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the supervisor to specify minimum amounts (such
as 100 shares) in which blocks of securities are to be sold. In effecting
purchases and sales of a trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,
including brokers which may be affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or
dealers participating in the offering of units.






Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Units



Public Offering Price. Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price (which is based on the aggregate underlying value of the securities in the
trust and includes the initial sales fee plus a pro rata share of any
accumulated amounts in the accounts of the trust). The initial sales fee is
equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the
remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee ("C&D Fee").
The maximum sales fee is set forth in Part A of the prospectus. The deferred
sales fee and the C&D Fee will be collected as described in this prospectus.
Units purchased subsequent to the initial deferred sales fee payment will be
subject to the initial sales fee, the remaining deferred sales fee payments and
the C&D Fee. Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable
deferred sales fee has been collected will be assessed the remaining deferred
sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption. During the initial offering
period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of securities
to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a trust
("organization costs"). These organization costs include the cost of preparing
the registration statement, the trust indenture and other closing documents,
registering units with the Securities and Exchange Commission and states, the
initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees, fees paid to a portfolio
consultant for assisting the sponsor in selecting the trust's portfolio, and the
initial fees and expenses of the trustee. These costs will be deducted from a
trust as of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, at the
discretion of the sponsor. As indicated above, the initial public offering price
of the units was established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the
securities by the number of units outstanding. Such price determination as of
the opening of business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of
an evaluation of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator. After
the opening of business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be
appraised daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of the
New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and will
adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation.
Such public offering price will be effective for all orders properly received at
or prior to the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each such
day. Orders received by the trustee, sponsor or any dealer for purchases, sales
or redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is
closed, will be held until the next determination of price.


The value of the securities is determined on each business day by the
evaluator based on the closing sale prices on a national securities exchange or
the NASDAQ National Market System or by taking into account the same factors
referred to under "Computation of Redemption Price."


Public Distribution of Units. During the initial offering period, units of
a trust will be distributed to the public at the public offering price thereof.
Upon the completion of the initial offering, units which remain unsold or which
may be acquired in the secondary market may be offered at the public offering
price determined in the manner provided above.


The sponsor intends to qualify units of a trust for sale in a number of
states. Units will be sold through dealers who are members of FINRA and through
others. Broker-dealers and others will be allowed a concession or agency
commission in connection with the distribution of units during the initial
offering period as set forth in the prospectus.


Certain commercial banks may be making units of a trust available to their
customers on an agency basis. Furthermore, as a result of certain legislative
changes effective November 1999, banks are no longer prohibited from certain
affiliations with securities firms. This new legislation grants banks new
authority to conduct certain authorized activity, such as sales of units,
through financial subsidiaries. A portion of the sales charge discussed above
is retained by or remitted to the banks or their financial subsidiaries for
these agency and brokerage transactions. The sponsor reserves the right to
change the concessions or agency commissions set forth in the prospectus from
time to time. In addition to such concessions or agency commissions, the
sponsor may, from time to time, pay or allow additional concessions or agency
commissions, in the form of cash or other compensation, to dealers employing
registered representatives who sell, during a specified time period, a minimum
dollar amount of units of unit investment trusts underwritten by the sponsor.
At various times the sponsor may implement programs under which the sales force
of a broker or dealer may be eligible to win nominal awards for certain sales
efforts, or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such broker or dealer
that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the sponsor, or participates in sales programs sponsored by the
sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the
sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such
programs. Also, the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to
objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokers or
dealers for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to
result in sales of units of a trust. Such payments are made by the sponsor out
of its own assets, and not out of the assets of any trust. These programs will
not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that a trust
will receive from the units sold. The difference between the discount and the
sales charge will be retained by the sponsor.


The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.


Sponsor Profits. The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the public offering price of the units of a trust described in
the prospectus. In addition, the sponsor may realize a profit (or sustain a
loss) as of the date a trust is created resulting from the difference between
the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such
securities to the trust. Thereafter, on subsequent deposits the sponsor may
realize profits or sustain losses from such deposits. The sponsor may realize
additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units
as a result of changes in the daily market value of the securities in the
trust.


Market for Units. After the initial offering period, the sponsor may
maintain a market for units of a trust offered hereby and continuously offer to
purchase said units at prices, determined by the evaluator, based on the value
of the underlying securities. Unitholders who wish to dispose of their units
should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption
price and, if so, the amount thereof. Unitholders who sell or redeem units
prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been
collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at
the time of such sale or redemption. The offering price of any units resold by
the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective
prospectus describing such units. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale
of such units will belong to the sponsor. If the sponsor decides to maintain a
secondary market, it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust
if the supply of units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.


Redemption. A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making
a written request to the trustee at its Unit Investment Trust Division office
in the city of New York. Unitholders must sign the request, and such transfer
instrument, exactly as their names appear on the records of the trustee. If the
amount of the redemption is $500 or less and the proceeds are payable to the
unitholder(s) of record at the address of record, no signature guarantee is
necessary for redemptions by individual account owners (including joint
owners). Additional documentation may be requested, and a signature guarantee
is always required, from corporations, executors, administrators, trustees,
guardians or associations. The signatures must be guaranteed by a participant
in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other
signature guaranty program in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as
may be accepted by the trustee.


Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the third business
day following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the
"Redemption Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price,
determined as set forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of
the close of the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied
by the number of units being redeemed. Any units redeemed shall be canceled and
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished. The price
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of
redemption. Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or
redemption. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing
redemption requests.


Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax
identification number in the manner required by such regulations. Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by
the unitholder only when filing a tax return. Under normal circumstances the
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling
broker. However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up
withholding." In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such
number, one must be provided at the time redemption is requested. Any amounts
paid on redemption representing unpaid dividends shall be withdrawn from the
Income Account of a trust to the extent that funds are available for such
purpose. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the
Capital Account for a trust.


Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request an in-kind
distribution (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash
redemption. A unitholder may request a Distribution In Kind of an amount and
value of securities per unit equal to the redemption price per unit as
determined as of the evaluation time next following the tender, provided that
the tendering unitholder is (i) entitled to receive at least $25,000 of
proceeds as part of his or her distribution or if he paid at least $25,000 to
acquire the units being tendered; and (ii) the unitholder has elected to redeem
at least thirty business days prior to the termination of the trust. If the
unitholder meets these requirements, a Distribution In Kind will be made by the
trustee through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book
entry form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at
Depository Trust Company. The tendering unitholder shall be entitled to receive
whole shares of each of the securities comprising the portfolio of the trust
and cash from the Capital Account equal to the fractional shares to which the
tendering unitholder is entitled. The trustee shall make any adjustments
necessary to reflect differences between the redemption price of the units and
the value of the securities distributed in kind as of the date of tender. If
funds in the Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required cash
distribution to the tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities. The
in-kind redemption option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. The
trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for
the redemption of units. To the extent that securities are sold or redeemed in
kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced
but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same
proportional interest in each security. Sales may be required at a time when
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than
might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or
less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the
securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.


Unitholders of a trust that holds closed-end funds or other investment
company securities who request a Distribution In Kind will be subject to any
12b-1 Fees or other service or distribution fees applicable to the underlying
securities.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for more
than three business days following the day on which tender for redemption is
made (i) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed,
other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as
determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York
Stock Exchange is restricted; (ii) for any period during which an emergency
exists as a result of which disposal by the trustee of securities is not
reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine
the value of the underlying securities in accordance with the trust agreement;
or (iii) for such other period as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by
order permit. The trustee is not liable to any person in any way for any loss or
damage which may result from any such suspension or postponement.


Computation of Redemption Price. The redemption price per unit (as well as
the secondary market public offering price) will generally be determined on the
basis of the last sale price of the securities in a trust. The redemption price
per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in a trust determined generally on
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being
collected; and (ii) the value of the securities in the trust less (a) amounts
representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust, (b)
any amount owing to the trustee for its advances and (c) the accrued expenses or
remaining deferred sales fees of the trust. During the initial offering period,
the redemption price and the secondary market repurchase price will also include
estimated organizational costs. The evaluator may determine the value of the
securities in the trust in the following manner: if the securities are listed on
a national or foreign securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System,
such evaluation shall generally be based on the last available sale price on or
immediately prior to the Evaluation Time on the exchange or NASDAQ National
Market System which is the principal market therefor, which shall be deemed to
be the New York Stock Exchange if the securities are listed thereon (unless the
evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) or, if there
is no such available sale price on such exchange, at the last available bid
prices (offer prices for primary market purchases) of the securities. Securities
not listed on the New York Stock Exchange but principally traded on the NASDAQ
National Market System will be valued at the NASDAQ National Market System's
official closing price. If the securities are not so listed or, if so listed,
the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange or there is no such
available sale price on such exchange, such evaluation shall generally be based
on the following methods or any combination thereof whichever the evaluator
deems appropriate: (i) on the basis of the current bid price (offer prices for
primary market purchases) for comparable securities (unless the evaluator deems
such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation); (ii) by determining the
valuation of the securities on the bid side (offer side for primary market
purchases) of the market by appraisal; or (iii) by any combination of the above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the evaluator or its designee, will generally
value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair
value which may be other than their market price. If the trust holds securities
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the evaluation of such
security is based upon U.S. dollars based on current bid side (offer side for
primary market purchases) exchange rates (unless the evaluator deems such prices
inappropriate as a basis for valuation).


Retirement Plans. A trust may be well suited for purchase by Individual
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement
plans. Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from federal taxation. All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for
special income averaging or tax deferred rollover treatment. Investors
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan. Such plans are offered
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions. The trust will lower the
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts to 1 unit. Fees and charges
with respect to such plans may vary.


Ownership of Units. Ownership of units will not be evidenced by
certificates. All evidence of ownership of units will be recorded in book entry
form at Depository Trust Company ("DTC") through an investor's brokers' account.
Units held through DTC will be registered in the nominee name of Cede & Co.
Individual purchases of beneficial ownership interest in the trust will be made
in book entry form through DTC. Ownership and transfer of units will be
evidenced and accomplished by book entries made by DTC and its participants. DTC
will record ownership and transfer of the units among DTC participants and
forward all notices and credit all payments received in respect of the units
held by the DTC participants. Beneficial owners of units will receive written
confirmation of their purchases and sale from the broker dealer or bank from
whom their purchase was made. Units are transferable by making a written request
properly accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer which
should be sent registered or certified mail for the protection of the
unitholder. Record holders must sign such written request exactly as their names
appear on the records of the trust. The signatures must be guaranteed by a
participant in the STAMP or such other signature guaranty program in addition
to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be acceptable by the trustee.


Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any multiple
thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement. Fractions of units, if
any, will be computed to three decimal places.



Taxes



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning units of the trust. This section is current as of the
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you
are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with
special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state,
local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel
to the sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust. This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Trust Status. Your trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws. If your trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital
gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary income
distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax
rates. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term
capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units. To determine
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of
your other taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, your trust may
make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus
will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions from
your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in
additional units or receive them in cash. The income from your trust that you
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31
of the previous year. Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
2010," income from a trust may also be subject to a new 3.8% "Medicare tax"
imposed for taxable years beginning after 2012. This tax will generally apply to
your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain
threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing
joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.


Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount
you receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your units is generally equal
to the cost of your units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.


Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital
gain is generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for taxpayers
in the 25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets. Some portion of your capital gains dividends may be
attributable to the Trust's interest in a master limited partnership which may
be subject to a maximum marginal stated federal income tax rate of 28%, rather
than the rates set forth above. In the case of capital gains dividends, the
determination of which portion of the capital gains dividend, if any, is
subject to the 28% tax rate, will be made based on rules prescribed by the
United States Treasury. Capital gains may also be subject to the Medicare tax
described above.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The
tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats
certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.


Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself. Your trust
will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which
may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains
tax rates.


In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when
you redeem units or up to 30 business days before your trust terminates.
However, this ability to request an in-kind distribution will terminate at any
time that the number of outstanding units has been reduced to 10% or less of
the highest number of units issued by the trust. By electing to receive an
in-kind distribution, you will receive trust securities plus, possibly, cash.
This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and
you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally based on the value at that
time of the securities and the amount of cash received. The Internal Revenue
Service could, however, assert that a loss could not be currently deducted.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over
into a future series of the trust, the exchange would generally be considered a
sale for federal income tax purposes.


Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases,
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as
income. In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Some
individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their
itemized deductions, depending on their income.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the
tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your
trust paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will
include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries. You may be
able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.


Investments in Certain Foreign Corporations. If the trust holds an equity
interest in any "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are
generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual
gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents
and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in
investments producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S.
federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain
distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or
gain is timely distributed to its Unitholders. The trust will not be able to
pass through to its Unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes. The
trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax
consequences. In this case, the trust would recognize as ordinary income any
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.
Under this election, the trust might be required to recognize in a year income
in excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to
the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the
4% excise tax. Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as qualified dividend
income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax
treaties, distributions from your trust will be characterized as dividends for
federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust properly
reports as capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes,
including withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.
However, distributions received by a foreign investor from your trust that are
properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to
U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met. Distributions in
respect of units may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of
distributions to (i) certain non-U.S. financial institutions that have not
entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose
certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered
into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury; and (ii) certain other non-U.S.
entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the
entity's U.S. owners. Dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to
such withholding after December 31, 2016.

Description of Ratings




Standard & Poor's Issue Credit Ratings



A Standard & Poor's issue credit rating is a forward-looking opinion about
the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial
obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a specific financial
program (including ratings on medium-term note programs and commercial paper
programs). It takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors,
insurers, or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into
account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. The opinion
reflects Standard & Poor's view of the obligor's capacity and willingness to
meet its financial commitments as they come due, and may assess terms, such as
collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate payment in
the event of default.


Issue credit ratings can be either long-term or short-term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the
relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper.
Short-term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor
with respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual
rating, in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to
the usual long-term rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.


The ratings and other credit related opinions of Standard & Poor's and its
affiliates are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not
statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell any securities
or make any investment decisions. Standard & Poor's assumes no obligation to
update any information following publication. Users of ratings and credit
related opinions should not rely on them in making any investment decision.
Standard & Poor's opinions and analyses do not address the suitability of any
security. Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC does not act as a fiduciary
or an investment advisor. While Standard & Poor's has obtained information from
sources it believes to be reliable, Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit
and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any
information it receives. Ratings and credit related opinions may be changed,
suspended, or withdrawn at any time.


Long-term issue credit ratings


Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


o    Likelihood of payment-capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation;


o    Nature of and provisions of the obligation; and


o    Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under
the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


Issue ratings are an assessment of default risk, but may incorporate an
assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default.
Junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations, to
reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation
may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations, secured
and unsecured obligations, or operating company and holding company
obligations).


AAA  An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard
& Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on
the obligation is extremely strong.


AA   An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations
only to a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is very strong.


A    An obligation rated "A" is somewhat susceptible to the adverse
economic conditions and changes in circumstances.


BBB  An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate capacity to meet financial
commitments, but more subject to adverse economic condition.


BBB- Considered the lowest investment-grade by market participants.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC," and "C" are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the
least degree of speculation and "C" the highest. While such
obligations will likely have some quality and protective
characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or
major exposures to adverse conditions.


BB+  Considered highest speculative grade by market participants.


BB   An obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable in the near-term but faces
major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial
and economic conditions.


B    An obligation rated "B" is more vulnerable to adverse business,
financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to
meet financial commitments.


CCC  An obligation rated "CCC" is currently vulnerable and dependent upon
favorable business, financial and economic conditions to meet its
financial commitments.


CC   An obligation rated "CC" is currently highly vulnerable.


C    A "C" rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages
allowed by the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer
that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which
have not experienced a payment default. Among others, the "C" rating
may be assigned to subordinated debt, preferred stock or other
obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance
with the instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the subject of
a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is
either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other
instruments having a total value that is less than par.


D    An obligation rated "D" is in payment default. The "D" rating category
is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due
even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard &
Poor's believes that such payments will be made during such grace
period. The "D" rating also will be used upon the filing of a
bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on
an obligation are jeopardized.


Plus (+) or minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories.


NR   This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard &
Poor's does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.
