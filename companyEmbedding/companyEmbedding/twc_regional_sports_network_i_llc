Time Warner Cable Sports Unveils Regional Sports Networks' Launch Plans




Submitted by nkioski on Thu, 2012-05-10 10:35


      May 10, 2012 10:35 am PDT    

New Networks Debut October 1 Delivering Year-Round Slate of Live Sports, News and Analysis Featuring Los Angeles Lakers, LA Galaxy and Los Angeles Sparks
Time Warner Cable Deportes, the First Spanish-Language Regional Sports Network, Will Provide Region’s Only Comprehensive Spanish Sports Coverage
On-Air Roster Includes Stu Lantz, Bill Macdonald, Adrian Garcia Marquez, Francisco Pinto, Andy Adler and Heidi Watney
 Time Warner Cable Sports today unveiled launch plans for the company’s two new regional sports networks debuting on October 1, 2012 to serve Southern California-area sports fans. The networks, brandedTime Warner Cable SportsNet and Time Warner Cable Deportes, will deliver the region’s most comprehensive sports information, complementing a year-round schedule of more than 120 live sports events as the new exclusive local homes of the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Galaxy and Los Angeles Sparks.

Beginning with the 2012-13 NBA season, the networks’ exclusive game coverage will include full seasons of Lakers, Galaxy and Sparks games, as well as CIF high school regular season and playoff contests. This is the first time in history that all locally televised Lakers games will be available on one network. Beyond live game coverage, Time Warner Cable Sports is creating a daily programming schedule to give local sports fans comprehensive in-depth coverage, fresh opinions and behind-the-scenes insight into their favorite local teams and personalities.
 
“We are building Time Warner Cable SportsNet and Time Warner Cable Deportes from the ground up to be the new homes for Southern California sports fans,” said Time Warner Cable Sports President David Rone. “Our networks are created around live coverage of some of the region’s signature franchises and represent a 24/7 commitment to give fans more access and insight than they have ever seen before.”
Added Mark Shuken, Senior Vice President and General Manager for Time Warner Cable Sports Regional Networks, “Because Southern California is home to some of the most intensely loyal fans in the country, we’re developing these networks from the fans’ perspective and investing in the technology and talent needed to respect that passion. Whether in their living rooms or on the go, fans will always be able to follow their local teams with our multiplatform coverage.”
Recognizing the importance of Hispanic consumers in Southern California, Time Warner Cable Sports is launching Time Warner Cable Deportes, the nation’s first Spanish-language regional sports network. Time Warner Cable Deportes will broadcast all local Lakers and Galaxy games entirely in Spanish – also a first. To bring this unique and customized experience to its audience, Time Warner Cable Deportes will feature separate production teams, Spanish-speaking talent and a distinct graphics package. Additionally, Time Warner Cable Deportes has built a dedicated team that will oversee the production of original programming including daily local sports news, a daily soccer news show and coverage of other sports including boxing and lucha libre.
Southern California sports fans will see a talented mix of familiar and new on-air game and news personalities, including Lakers broadcasters Stu Lantz and Bill Macdonald on Time Warner Cable SportsNet and Adrian Garcia Marquez and Francisco Pinto on Time Warner Cable Deportes. Also joining the networks are two noted and highly experienced sports journalists. Studio host Andy Adler, formerly of KNBC and WNYW, will anchor nightly studio programming from the networks' new state-of-the-art technical facility and Heidi Watney, former reporter for the Boston Red Sox and NESN, will report on and interview teams, athletes and fans while on-the-scene.
The networks are employing the latest technology to give fans on the go the most current coverage and updates in English and Spanish. Both networks will feature live in-market game streaming to personal computers and mobile devices, and an integrated interactive social media experience catering to the unique passions that make sports a community activity.

Regional Sports Network







I live in Northwest Ohio (near Toledo) and I am a Huge Detroit Tigers fan! Unfortunately TWC for some strange reason does not offer me Fox Sports Detroit even though I am considered to be in the local market. This is the sole reason that I am a Direct TV subscriber.  I realize that the regional home office for TWC is in Columbus so they assume that everyone in Ohio must love the Reds (so they offer FSO), but you guys are missing the boat! Around here you will not find one single Reds fan (ALL Indians and Tigers), but you will find a whole lot of dishes! If you guys would offer FSD, I can guarantee you at least one subscriber and probably a whole lot more will come with me!

Re: Regional Sports Network







I do apologize but that is not something that is determined by us. It is determined by Fox Sports. For example since you are in Ohio you would get Fox Sports Ohio. This is not something we have any control over.

Re: Regional Sports Network







If that's the case, why do I get the channel through direct tv? Why is it that the online sports package (i.e. mlb.tv) considers Detroit to be my home market? I

DAN FINNERTY NAMED SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, TWC SPORTS

Release Date: 07/07/2011


(NEW YORK, NY)  – Time Warner Cable today announced that Dan Finnerty has been named Senior Vice President for TWC Sports. Reporting to David Rone, President of TWC Sports, Finnerty's responsibilities will include business development for TWC Sports and leading the affiliate sales and affiliate marketing efforts for the TWC Sports Regional Networks.
In February 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Lakers entered into a 20-year, wide-ranging agreement for rights to distribute all locally available pre-season, regular season, and post-season Lakers games, beginning with the 2012-2013 season. To showcase the games, Time Warner Cable will launch two regional sports networks in HD, including the nation’s first Spanish-language regional sports network, with new state-of-the-art facilities in Los Angeles, to bring fans the most compelling Lakers content using the latest technology. The networks will be available to all satellite, cable and telco distributors in the Lakers’ territory, which includes all of Southern California, Nevada and Hawaii. 
 “Dan is well known and highly respected in our industry,” Rone said.  “He’s an innovative thinker, which will be critical to building the TWC Sports brand among consumers. He also has years of experience as a leader in securing broad distribution for regional sports networks and a true passion for sports.  Through his strong relationships, he’ll be a key asset in growing our business. We’re very excited to have him on board.”
Most recently, Finnerty was Executive Vice President, Network Distribution & Development for Comcast Networks, where he co-managed a cross-functional team of more than 50 professionals responsible for distribution/affiliate sales and business development for all Comcast owned or managed networks, including their regional sports networks. During his six-years at Comcast Networks, he was also instrumental in securing critical distribution for a number of start-up networks.  Prior to joining Comcast, Dan held senior sales roles with start-up HorseRacing TV and digital media company Organic Inc.  He has also worked as a trial attorney and marine engineer. Finnerty holds a Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering from the United States Merchant Marine Academy, and a Juris Doctor from George Mason University. He will reside in Los Angeles.
