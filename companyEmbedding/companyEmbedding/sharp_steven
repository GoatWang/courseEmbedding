 About the Author 

 Steven Sharp Nelson

 Steven Sharp Nelson is a pioneer in “cello-percussion”—an alternative performance method that combines traditional, lyrical cello techniques and unconventional pizzicato and percussive technique. He began studying cello at age 8, percussion at age 12 and guitar at age 17. He has invented a new method of playing the cello that combines elements learned from each of these instruments. He obtained a degree in music from the University of Utah School of Music, graduating in 2002.

Nelson’s true cello career began when he was 15. He was recruited by Peter Breinholt to arrange string parts and perform with Breinholt’s band, Big Parade. Since then he has recorded on over 100 different albums ranging from folk & bluegrass to hip hop. He has also made his way as a solo artist. His first album Sacred Cello (2006) was atop the Billboard Charts. He has since two more solo albums that have also received significant acclaim (Tender Mercies, 2008 and Christmas Cello, 2010)

Nelson is well known for his collaborations with pianist Jon Schmidt as The Piano Guys – most particularly in their mash-up arrangement of Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” and Coldplay’s “Viva La Vida,” a YouTube sensation. Schmidt and Nelson perform regularly together throughout the United States and the world.

  Love ThisBy DeAnn, Submitted on 2015-02-25I don't listen to a lot of instrumental music so I didn't expect to be wowed by this.  But I am officially "WOWed".  This had so many of my favorite songs - many that i turn to when I am in need of peace.  The arrangements were amazing.  The blending of the instruments and the cello I found moving and touching.  This is one I will listen to over and and over and share as gifts.  I highly recommend this.

  Nothing short of beautifulBy Cherilyn, Submitted on 2015-02-25I listen to this CD more than any other I own. This is most often just as I am about to go to sleep, because its peacefulness and inspiration go hand in hand. The cello is a beautiful instrument, and in this case so wonderfully used to express love for the gospel.
 




  In total Awe! By Christie , Submitted on 2015-02-25This CD is wonderful.  The title track, Tender Mercies is breath taking.  I especially enjoyed the arrangement of Praise To The Man.  Great, great CD! 
 




  Beautiful!By Natalie, Submitted on 2015-02-25Tender Mercies is a wonderful collection of music. The deep tones of the cello combined with the moving music are the perfect way to start your sabbath day.
 




  A Gorgeous Recording!By Devin , Submitted on 2015-02-25He's done it again. Making a full length cello album that kept me captivated. Every piece is exquisite. The full orchestra serene. The album begins with a beautiful solo piece followed by a powerful version of Come, Come Ye Saints with full orchestra. He does Ennio MOrricone's Gabriel's Oboe from the film The Mission which is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. The entire album continues to flow with a few solo, then orchestra, and with piano and guitar. Thanks Steve for another fantastic recording. There is a very sweet spirit when I play this in my car to work.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Steven Elmer Sharp can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
