SECURE-C®




The SECURE-C® Cervical Artificial Disc is a motion-sparing technology designed as an alternative to fusion. Through its unique selectively constrained design, SECURE-C® is designed to allow up to ±15º motion in flexion-extension and up to ±10º motion in lateral bending. The design is intended to allow unlimited axial rotation and to permit sagittal plane translation of ±1.25mm. Clinical study data demonstrates statistical superority of SECURE-C® ACDF in terms of overall success, subsequent surgery, and patient satisfaction at 24 months postoperative.

Motion Preservation: SECURE-C® is designed to allow motion through its novel selectively constrained design, which provides articulation and sagittal plane translation.

Optimal Fit: SECURE-C® is available in two sagittal profiles (0º & 6º lordosis) and a range of footprints and heights to fit the disc space and curvature of the spine.

Streamlined Technique: Exclusive instrumentation allows device placement in three basic steps: Trial – Chisel – Insert

KINEX®



KINEX® Bioactive’s components are designed to recruit and signal osteoblasts, promote early vascular development and bind proteins necessary for bone regeneration.

Cell Recruitment and Signaling: The regeneration of damaged bone tissue involves the migration and proliferation of osteoblasts to the site. Bioactive glass recruits these cells and stimulates the production of growth factors that amplify the cellular activity responsible for bone formation. (1, 2, 3)

Angiogenic Potential: Hyaluronic acid has been shown to help promote early vascularization and attract osteogenic precursor cells, which may lead to earlier bone formation. (4, 5)

Protein and Cell Binding: Collagen provides a resorbable osteoconductive scaffold that binds proteins and cells. (6, 7)

 

Surgeon Overview

KINEX®



KINEX® Bioactive’s components are designed to recruit and signal osteoblasts, promote early vascular development and bind proteins necessary for bone regeneration.

Cell Recruitment and Signaling: The regeneration of damaged bone tissue involves the migration and proliferation of osteoblasts to the site. Bioactive glass recruits these cells and stimulates the production of growth factors that amplify the cellular activity responsible for bone formation. (1, 2, 3)

Angiogenic Potential: Hyaluronic acid has been shown to help promote early vascularization and attract osteogenic precursor cells, which may lead to earlier bone formation. (4, 5)

Protein and Cell Binding: Collagen provides a resorbable osteoconductive scaffold that binds proteins and cells. (6, 7)

SILC®



SILC® is a low-profile fixation system that is easy to insert and provides the stability to perform standard reduction maneuvers without requiring pedicle purchase. This sublaminar polyethylene terephthalate (PET) band system adapts to complex anatomies of the most severe spinal deformities and utilizes the strength of laminar cortical bone, which may be necessary for compromised pedicle anatomy and/or poor bone quality. The top-loading clamp with medial/lateral set screw orientation allows implant insertion at any time during surgery.

Intraoperative Versatility: Top-loading clamp in three sizes accommodates multiple patient types, correction techniques and rod diameters.

 Smooth Assembly: Streamlined Tensioner with simple steps for clamp insertion through final tightening.

Strong Connection: The rigid clamp and SILC® band construct allows for powerful correction.

SILC®



SILC® is a low-profile fixation system that is easy to insert and provides the stability to perform standard reduction maneuvers without requiring pedicle purchase. This sublaminar polyethylene terephthalate (PET) band system adapts to complex anatomies of the most severe spinal deformities and utilizes the strength of laminar cortical bone, which may be necessary for compromised pedicle anatomy and/or poor bone quality. The top-loading clamp with medial/lateral set screw orientation allows implant insertion at any time during surgery.

Intraoperative Versatility: Top-loading clamp in three sizes accommodates multiple patient types, correction techniques and rod diameters.

 Smooth Assembly: Streamlined Tensioner with simple steps for clamp insertion through final tightening.

Strong Connection: The rigid clamp and SILC® band construct allows for powerful correction.

KINEX® PLUS Bioactive



KINEX® PLUS Bioactive’s components are designed to recruit and signal osteoblasts, promote early vascular development and bind proteins necessary for bone regeneration. KINEX® PLUS utilizes The Power of Bioactive Glass™ to help promote bone formation and healing in the posterolateral spine, pelvis, and extremities.

Cell Recruitment and Signaling: The regeneration of damaged bone tissue involves the migration and proliferation of osteoblasts to the site. Bioglass® recruits these cells and stimulates the production of growth factors that amplify the cellular activity responsible for bone formation. (1, 2, 3)

Angiogenic Potential: Hyaluronic acid has been shown to help promote early vascularization and attracts osteogenic precursor cells, which may lead to earlier bone formation. (4, 5)

Protein and Cell Binding: Collagen provides a resorbable osteoconductive scaffold that binds proteins and cells. (6, 7)

 

 
KINEX® PLUS Bioactive provides exceptional handling characteristics and is available as Putty and Gel.

KINEX® PLUS Putty: Moldable putty that is cohesive and easily packs into in the posterolateral spine or bone voids.

KINEX® PLUS Gel: Extrudable formula packaged in a luer lock syringe for controlled delivery.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
