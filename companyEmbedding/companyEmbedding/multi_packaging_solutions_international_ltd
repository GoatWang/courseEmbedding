Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

 Multi Packaging Solutions International Ltd	
Business Description








We are a leading, global provider of value-added specialty packaging solutions, 
  based on sales, focused on high complexity products for the consumer, healthcare 
  and multi-media markets. We believe that our core addressable consumer and healthcare 
  end markets encompass attractive, resilient and growing packaging categories, 
  and we believe we are a leader in these end markets across North America and 
  Europe based on sales. Additionally, we believe we have a market-leading position 
  in the multi-media specialty packaging sector based on sales. We provide our 
  customers with an extensive array of print-based specialty packaging solutions, 
  including premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging across 
  a variety of substrates and finishes, which are complemented by value-added 
  services, including creative design, new product development and customized 
  supply chain solutions. 
We believe we are one of a few companies in the end markets we serve offering 
  a full range of products across multiple geographies, allowing us to provide 
  specialty packaging solutions for customers locally and globally, a capability 
  our customers find valuable in presenting a consistent image of the underlying 
  product. Our global manufacturing footprint consists of 59 manufacturing sites 
  and eight sales offices across North America, Europe and Asia. Our strategically 
  located facilities have enabled us to grow our business by leveraging our customer 
  relationships across multiple geographies and products, and drive incremental 
  growth through our ability to integrate and improve our customers’ supply 
  chains. 
Our End Markets

  Consumer

  We produce a full line of specialty print-based packaging products for a wide 
  range of customers in the personal care, spirits, cosmetics and confectionary 
  markets. We focus on the premium end of the market where high-impact graphics, 
  and innovative designs and finishes attract attention and help brands drive 
  “top-of-mind” positioning with consumers at the point-of-purchase. 
  Our scale and financial resources have enabled us to build out a leading global 
  design division which has been at the forefront of our product innovation capabilities. 
  Multinational customers have also increasingly centralized their procurement 
  functions seeking fewer, more strategic partners capable of meeting their consumer 
  packaging needs and consistent marketing image across a range of products, services 
  and geographies. We are well-positioned to benefit from this trend in vendor 
  rationalization by leveraging our ability to deliver a broad range of local 
  solutions while simultaneously providing global coverage to our multinational 
  customers. 
This market is driven by:

  Shortened product life cycle—Focus on new product introductions with unique 
  packaging designs that promote brand identity and on-shelf differentiation in 
  order to drive growth. In order to achieve the first-mover advantage, personal 
  care companies rely on suppliers able to rapidly design and commercialize these 
  new, high quality packages.

  Enhanced product design and brand promotion—Personal care companies have 
  increasing demand for packaging suppliers who are able to offer new technologies 
  and services to promote brand identity, premium positioning and shelf appeal. 
  This trend increasingly favors suppliers with differentiated capabilities, such 
  as finishing technologies for iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional 
  effects.

  Positive demographic trends and increasing health and wellness awareness—The 
  growing and aging population sensitive about preserving a youthful image is 
  driving a positive shift in the consumption patterns of personal care products, 
  including products used to reverse signs of aging, such as anti-wrinkle skin 
  creams, lotions, serums and hair colorants. People are generally tending to 
  take better care of themselves and are willing to pay more for products with 
  perceived benefits.

  Increasing disposable premiumization—Individuals have greater capability 
  to purchase higher end consumer products, particularly in developing regions 
  such as Asia and Latin America. Sophisticated packaging solutions allow for 
  better shelf visibility and brand positioning. The propensity to use secondary 
  packaging, such as premium rigid boxes and labeling, is higher in premium type 
  spirits and confections, as it represents one of the principal ways to command 
  higher price points and differentiate products.

  Demand for sustainable and intelligent packaging—Increasing consumer focus 
  on environmental issues and recyclability of materials represents an opportunity 
  for advanced high value-add producers to further strengthen market positions. 
  Consumers are increasingly purchasing products that are sustainable and offer 
  recyclable packaging and many companies have embraced this trend, moving towards 
  eco-friendly products.
Healthcare

  Healthcare packaging is used in a wide variety of applications including over-the-counter 
  and prescription pharmaceuticals, medical devices, nutritional and dietary supplements, 
  vitamins and minerals. We offer a full line of print-based packaging products 
  serving the healthcare market, including folding cartons, inserts, labels, outserts 
  and booklets. The healthcare packaging market is characterized by significant 
  technical requirements, recession-resilient demand characteristics and numerous 
  growth opportunities. Healthcare packaging has stringent quality specifications, 
  prerequisite manufacturing standards and evolving regulatory requirements. Product 
  innovation plays a key role in the industry as pharmaceutical manufacturers 
  increasingly incorporate authentication features into packaging to assist in 
  the prevention of counterfeiting. We have developed strong relationships with 
  leading healthcare companies as a result of our high-quality products, expertise 
  in print technologies including digital print supply solutions, and quick response 
  and turnaround times. 
This market is driven by:

  Population demographics—Population growth, an increased focus on chronic 
  diseases and the aging population have increased the market for pharmaceuticals 
  as consumers require a growing number and diversity of prescription and over-the-counter 
  medicines and nutritional supplements, including those that target age-related 
  conditions and illnesses.

  Globalization and vendor rationalization—Regulatory pressures and increased 
  product quality requirements have encouraged large multinational pharmaceutical 
  and supplement manufacturers to focus their packaging spend on fewer suppliers 
  that can provide consistent service and product quality on a global basis. We 
  believe this trend favors scale players with the capability to support product 
  launches across multiple products and geographies. We expect vendor rationalization 
  to continue as customers seek to contain costs without sacrificing logistical 
  flexibility and product quality.

  Increasing consumer awareness regarding health and wellness—Manufacturers 
  and marketers of nutritional and dietary supplements are continuously introducing 
  and marketing new product offerings in order to appeal to growing consumer awareness 
  regarding health and wellness and preventative medicine.

  Growth in drug treatments and availability—The volume of pharmaceutical 
  products available in the market has been expanding for both branded and generic 
  drugs. The demand for generic drugs may accelerate as some branded pharmaceutical 
  products become available in generic formulations after the expiration of patents. 
  While our branded business is set to grow with the overall market, we also expect 
  to benefit from the growth of generic pharmaceuticals.

  Evolving regulatory standards and regulations—Regulatory standards to 
  improve security and prevent drug counterfeiting as well as provide greater, 
  more accessible disclosure to patients and healthcare providers create a dynamic 
  regulatory environment that requires creative, value-added packaging solutions. 
  For example, the blister packaging market is expected to benefit from the implementation 
  of U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations requiring all prescribed pharmaceuticals 
  dispensed in hospitals and nursing homes to be packaged in unit dose formats 
  with barcodes in order to reduce dispensing errors. Overall drug spend is also 
  forecast to grow, given recent government legislation and regulation around 
  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
We own or lease 59 manufacturing facilities and several dedicated sales and 
  design offices in North America, Europe and Asia. Our facility network is strategically 
  located in close proximity to key customers.

  We employ a largely integrated, enterprise-wide approach to management of our 
  facilities and fundamental equipment, which enables us to redeploy plant assets 
  and production processes to match customer and profitability objectives. At 
  the same time, facility level specialization of our manufacturing footprint 
  based on customer needs, substrate capabilities and technological offerings 
  allows us to take advantage of enhanced profitability from efficiencies associated 
  with running larger volumes of consistent products at specific locations. Acquired 
  operations also benefit from this approach as business is optimized across the 
  broader facility network incorporating a process of asset redeployment, facility 
  rationalization and targeted capital investment.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated March 31, 2017 quarterly financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The statements in the discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and other forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. For purposes of this section, all references to "we," "us," "our," "MPS" or the "Company" refer to Multi Packaging Solutions International Limited and subsidiaries.  Any statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies. These statements often include words such as "anticipates," "expects," "suggests," "plans," "believes," "intends," "estimates," "targets," "projects," "should," "could," "would," "may," "will," "forecasts," and other similar expressions. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this quarterly report, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results.

Overview  We print and manufacture high quality paperboard, paper and plastic packaging in the North American, European and Asian segments. Within each of these geographic segments, we sell products into the healthcare, consumer and multi-media end markets.  The healthcare market includes pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and healthcare related products. The consumer market includes cosmetics, personal care and toiletries, food, spirits, sporting goods, transaction and gift cards, confectionary, liquor and general consumer products. The multi-media market includes home video, software, music, video games and media related special packaging products.  Products are manufactured in approximately 60 facilities located in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and China. We also have strategic alliances with companies in Europe and China who outsource certain products and production activities. In some cases, we procure non-paperboard, paper or plastic products to include in special packaging project deliverables for our customers. Products are generally cartons, labels, inserts or other paper or paperboard packaging products.  Cartons are generally paperboard based folding cartons. Labels are generally paper and pressure sensitive label stock printed products that are delivered in reel form or in a cut and stack form and can include basic labels for bottles and boxes, and extended content labels designed to deliver more information to the ultimate purchaser of our customer's products. Inserts include fine paper folded inserts used in the delivery of detailed warnings, instructions and other information to the ultimate purchaser of our customer's products. Other products include all remaining products. Often the project deliverables to a customer include all or a combination of these products.  Our strategic objectives are (i) continuing to enhance our position as a leading provider of packaging products to the  Table of Contents  segments we serve and can serve in North America, Europe and Asia; (ii) the expansion further into international markets to meet the global sourcing needs of our customers; and (iii) the identification of other areas in the packaging industry that can most benefit from our ability to deliver quality packaging products according to our customers' needs, including the leveraging of our recent transactions via cross-selling both products and geographies. To achieve these objectives, we intend to continue expanding our printing, packaging and graphic arts capabilities, including the development and application of advanced manufacturing technologies and the establishment of manufacturing facilities in strategic international markets.  Planned Merger with WestRock  On January 23, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, WestRock Company, a Delaware corporation ("WestRock"), and WRK Merger Sub Limited, a Bermuda exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock ("Merger Sub"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the "BCA"), with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each issued and outstanding common share of the Company (other than Company Shares (i) owned by WestRock, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock, (ii) owned by the Company or its subsidiaries or (iii) held by members who do not vote in favor of the Merger and comply with all of the provisions of the BCA concerning the rights of holders of common shares to require appraisal of their common shares pursuant to Bermuda law) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $18.00 per common share in cash subject to any applicable withholding of taxes, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award of the Company that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions and each restricted stock award of the Company that is then outstanding will be cancelled and terminated and each holder will have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of common shares subject to such award multiplied by  The consummation of the Merger is conditioned, among other things, on: (i) approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the statutory merger agreement between the Company and Merger Sub (the "Statutory Merger Agreement") by holders of at least three-fourths of the issued and outstanding common shares voting at the meeting of the members of the Company ("Company Shareholder Approval"), (ii) receipt of regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and antitrust notification and approvals required in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Canada, the European Union, and Mexico and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Merger Agreement generally requires each party to take all actions necessary to resolve objections under any antitrust law, except that WestRock is not required to take any Divestiture Action (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to any products, services, assets, businesses or contractual arrangements of: (i) the Company and its subsidiaries, if such Divestiture Action would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) WestRock or its subsidiaries. The Company or WestRock may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by October 23, 2017 (the "End Date"), which date may be extended to January 23, 2018 under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, WestRock, and Merger Sub. The Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time. The Company has also agreed, following receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire the Company and to certain restrictions on its ability to respond to any such proposals.  The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and WestRock, although  Table of Contents  following receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company would not be obligated to pay a termination fee upon any such termination.  The Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement were approved and adopted by the Company's shareholders on April 5, 2017 and has received the required antitrust approvals under the HSR Act and in Canada  Key Transactions  Acquisition of Paris Art Label  On April 28, 2017, we acquired the assets and business of Paris Art Label Company ("PAL"), a manufacturer of labels and shrink sleeve products to the branded consumer marketplace in the United States. The acquisition is consistent with the Company's previously announced strategy to expand its capability and presence in the label sector globally. Net sales for PAL for the most recently completed 12 months prior to the acquisition were approximately $26 million.  Acquisition of i3 Plastic Cards  On November 4, 2016, we acquired the assets and business of i3 Plastic Cards ("i3"), a fully-integrated solution provider for creating and personalizing plastic transaction cards including pre-paid gift and loyalty cards that is based in Dallas, Texas. The business complements the Company's existing transaction card operations and offers customers a broader range of options. Net sales for i3 for the most recently completed 12 months prior to the acquisition were approximately $13 million.  Acquisition of AJS  On October 14, 2016, we acquired AJS Group Limited ("AJS"), a leading supplier in the United Kingdom of self-adhesive labels. The addition of this specialist business complements our existing operations and extends our marketing capability and reach to customers within the branded consumer sectors and international beauty and personal care sectors. AJS' net sales for the most recently completed 12 months prior to the acquisitions were approximately �9 million (approximately $12 million).  Acquisition of Chicago Paper Tube and Can  On January 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Chicago Paper Tube and Can ("CPT"). CPT provides the Company with high end round rigid packaging capability in North America. CPT's net sales for the most recently completed 12 months prior to the acquisition were approximately $5 million.  Acquisition of BP Media  On July 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of BP Media, Ltd. ("BluePrint"). The acquisition of BluePrint provides us with pre-press and digital services in the European market, facilitating the processes surrounding translation and interchangeability of print content for foreign locations. In addition, BluePrint provides us with an established sales presence in the media markets in Europe, which will enable us to serve the European needs of global media releases. BluePrint's net sales for the most recently completed 12 months prior to the acquisition were approximately $23 million.  Acquisition Accounting  All of the transactions described above were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, in all cases the assets and liabilities of the acquired or merged entities were recorded at fair value as of the respective closing dates and the results of operations of the entities are included in our results of operations from the date of closing.  Table of Contents  Trends  General Information  Our largest customers are generally large multinational entities, many of which are consolidating global packaging requirements under a smaller number of suppliers. We believe we are favorably situated for this transition due to our many facilities, global footprint, standardized equipment from plant to plant and our relative size compared to other packaging suppliers. The packaging marketplace is very fragmented, with no one vendor providing a significant portion of the packaging needs.  Net Sales Trends  Net sales are impacted by the macroeconomic performance of our geographic segments and the markets within these geographic segments. Packaging net sales tend to be strongest just before the underlying customer's busy season, which for high-end branded products is generally strongest in our first and second fiscal quarters.  Healthcare net sales in each of our geographic segments are influenced by the severity of a particular region's cold and flu seasons, as well as the development and acceptance of certain new products, and the stage of product, from the prescription-only stage to the private label or generic stage.  European consumer net sales of confectionary products are generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season. North American and European consumer net sales of spirits are also generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season. Asia consumer net sales of spirits are generally stronger in their holiday season, generally in our third fiscal quarter.  The net sales to the North American multi-media end market are influenced by the success of a particular year's movie releases, which can generate special packaging needs for these customers. Net sales of packaging in the North American video game market are generally influenced by the age of existing, and introduction of new, gaming platforms. Product launches, which cannot be predicted far in advance, have an impact on net sales, particularly with respect to special packaging needed for the holiday season. Overall, we have experienced a decline in multi-media net sales in recent years and expect this trend to continue as a percentage of our total net sales.  Impact of Inflation and Pricing  We have not historically been and do not expect to be significantly impacted by inflation. Increases in payroll costs and any increases in raw material costs that we have encountered are generally able to be offset through lean manufacturing activities. We have consistently made annual investments in capital that deliver efficiencies and cost savings. The benefits of these efforts generally offset the margin impact of competitive pricing conditions in all of the markets we serve.  We remain sensitive to price competitiveness in the markets that we serve and in the areas that are targeted for growth, and believe that the installation of state-of-the-art printing and manufacturing equipment as well as utilization of lean manufacturing (and related labor and production efficiencies) will enable us to compete effectively.  Operational Restructurings  We regularly evaluate our operating facilities in our geographic segments in order to share best practices, ensure logistics that serve customers are appropriate and maximize our operating efficiencies. We have successfully integrated our acquisitions, have achieved our original synergy targets, and will continue to optimize our operations over the next several quarters. In connection with these evaluations, we have closed certain facilities in recent periods. The Company previously announced the closure of the former ASG facility located in Melrose Park, Illinois in September 2015, and the closure was completed in February 2016. In May 2016, we announced the intention to relocate our Stuttgart, Germany business, which was completed in March 2017. We have consolidated this facility into other existing facilities in Germany in order to better serve our customers and gain operational efficiencies. In August and December 2016, we announced our intention to close our Bradford and Portsmouth sites, respectively, in the United Kingdom as a result of a customer's consolidation of all their tobacco carton volumes with other existing suppliers. In October 2016, we announced the closure of one of our North America multi-media facilities in Louisville, Kentucky as a result of the recent sales declines in business in this end market. Finally, in March 2017, we announced the closure of our Montargis, France facility, which is expected to be completed by  Table of Contents  the end of June 2017. The business and customers served from this facility will be transferred to other sites in France.  Restructuring charges of $10.9 million were recorded in the nine months ended March 31, 2017, which were primarily related to the aforementioned Stuttgart, Bradford, Portsmouth, Louisville and Montargis sites. We believe all of these operational restructurings will have a positive impact on gross profit and gross profit percentage in future periods.  Our plans also include evaluating several other opportunities over the next few quarters in order to maximize the efficiency of our global manufacturing footprint. In connection with these plans, the Company may record additional restructuring and closure cost charges in the future.  Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016. The table below presents our results of operations for the respective periods. Three Months Ended March 31, (amounts in thousands) 2017 2016 Net sales $ 382,633 $ 399,184 Cost of goods sold 302,977 312,437 Gross profit 79,656 86,747 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses 57,199 60,259 Stock based and deferred compensation expense 726 104 Transaction related expenses 2,655 371 Total selling, general and administrative expenses 60,580 60,734 Operating income 19,076 26,013 Other income (expense), net 1,898 (1,262) Debt extinguishment charges - (64) Interest expense (11,927) (14,896) Total other expense, net (10,029) (16,222) Income before income taxes 9,047 9,791 Income tax (expense) benefit 1,234 (6,178) Consolidated net income 10,281 3,613 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 473 170 Net income attributable to shareholders of Multi Packaging Solutions International Limited $ 10,754 $ 3,783  Net Sales  The decrease in net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $16.6 million, or 4.1%, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency changes of $16.1 million, principally from translation differences, which resulted in reduced net sales as compared to the prior year period. Based on current foreign exchange rates, specifically the British Pound Sterling, we expect negative impacts from foreign exchange for the remainder of the current fiscal year when results are compared to the prior year period. We experienced strong sales in our European healthcare market which increased $7.0 million over the prior period on a constant currency basis, as well as general sales increases in our customer portfolio of $7.8 million excluding the following specific items that experienced a reduction in sales. Such specific decreases included a multi-media sales decline in North America of  Table of Contents  $4.4 million, a reduction of $3.7 million of sales for three customers in the tobacco industry in the United Kingdom, a reduction of $4.5 million of sales in the North America healthcare market and a reduction of $2.7 million of sales in the North America transaction card business.  We operate our business along the following operating segments, which are grouped based on geographic region: North America, Europe, and Asia. Net sales by geographic segment, as further broken down by end market, are summarized as follows:  Net Sales by Geographic Segment Three Months Ended March 31, (amounts in thousands) 2017 2016 North America Consumer $ 88,339 $ 87,926 Healthcare 72,507 76,977 Multi-Media 24,610 28,963 $ 185,456 $ 193,866 Europe Consumer $ 89,078 $ 96,691 Healthcare 83,071 83,949 Multi-Media 2,979 3,852 $ 175,128 $ 184,492 Asia Consumer $ 16,918 $ 14,961 Healthcare 5,131 5,865 $ 22,049 $ 20,826 Total $ 382,633 $ 399,184  North America  The decrease in North America net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $8.4 million, or 4.3%, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in multi-media . . .  May 12, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated December 31 quarterly financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The statements in the discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and other forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in our Registration Statement Filed on Form S-1. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion together with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report, as well as the Company's Registration Statement. All dollar values in this section, unless otherwise noted, are denominated in millions. For purposes of this section, all references to "we," "us," "our," "MPS" or the "Company" refer to Multi Packaging Solutions International Limited and subsidiaries.  Any statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies. These statements often include words such as "anticipate," "expect," "suggests," "plan," "believe," "intend," "estimates," "targets," "projects," "should," "could," "would," "may," "will," "forecast," and other similar expressions. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this quarterly report, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:   our ability to compete against competitors with greater resources or lower operating costs;   adverse developments in economic conditions, including downturns in the geographies and target markets that we serve;   difficulties in restructuring operations, closing facilities or disposing of assets;   our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions and identify and integrate future acquisitions;   our ability to realize the growth opportunities and cost savings and synergies we anticipate from the initiatives that we undertake;   changes in technology trends and our ability to develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences and regulatory environment;   the impact of electronic media and similar technological changes, including the substitution of physical products for digital content;   seasonal fluctuations;   the impact of significant regulations and compliance expenditures as a result of environmental, health and safety laws;   risks associated with our non-U.S. operations;   exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility;   the loss of, or reduced purchases by, one or more of our large customers;   failure to attract and retain key personnel;   increased information technology security threats and targeted cybercrime;   changes in the cost and availability of raw materials;   operational problems at our facilities;   the impact of any labor disputes or increased labor costs;   the failure of quality control measures and systems resulting in faulty or contaminated products;   the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks;   increased energy or transportation costs;   our ability to develop product innovations and improve production technology and expertise;   the impact of litigation, uninsured judgments or increased insurance premiums;   an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets;   our ability to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries and restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;   the impact of regulations to address climate change;   risks associated with the funding of our pension plans, including actions by governmental authorities;   the impact of regulations related to conflict minerals;   our ability to acquire and protect our intellectual property rights and avoid claims of intellectual property infringement;   risks related to our substantial indebtedness;   failure of internal controls over financial reporting;   the ability of The Carlyle Group and Madison Dearborn Partners to control us;   other factors disclosed in this quarterly report; and   other factors beyond our control.  Table of Contents  These cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this quarterly report. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Overview  We print and manufacture high quality paperboard, paper and plastic packaging in the North American, European and Asian segments. Within each of these geographic segments, we sell products into the healthcare, consumer and multi-media end markets.  The healthcare market includes pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and healthcare related products. The consumer market includes cosmetics, personal care and toiletries, food, spirits, sporting goods, transaction and gift cards, confectionary, liquor and general consumer products. The multi-media market includes home video, software, music, video games and media-related special packaging products.  Products are manufactured in 58 facilities located in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and China. We also have strategic alliances with companies in Europe and China who outsource certain products and production activities. In some cases, we procure non-paperboard, paper or plastic products to include in special packaging project deliverables for our customers. Products are generally cartons, labels, inserts or other paper or paperboard packaging products.  Cartons are generally paperboard based folding cartons. Labels are generally paper and pressure sensitive label stock printed products that are delivered in reel form or in a cut and stack form and can include basic labels for bottles and boxes, and extended content labels designed to deliver more information to the ultimate purchaser of our customer's products. Inserts include fine paper folded inserts used in the delivery of detailed warnings, instructions and other information to the ultimate purchaser of our customer's products. Other products include all remaining products. Often the project deliverables to a customer include all or a combination of these products.  Our strategic objectives are (i) continuing to enhance our position as a leading provider of packaging products to the segments we serve and can serve in North America, Europe and Asia; (ii) the expansion further into international markets to meet the global sourcing needs of our customers; and (iii) the identification of other areas in the packaging industry that can most benefit from our ability to deliver quality packaging products according to our customers' needs, including the leveraging of our recent transactions via cross-selling both products and geographies. To achieve these objectives, we intend to continue expanding our printing, packaging and graphic arts capabilities, including the development and application of advanced manufacturing technologies and the establishment of manufacturing facilities in strategic international markets.  Key Transactions  Acquisition of ASG North American, Mexican and China Print and Packaging Operations  On November 21, 2014 we completed the acquisition of the North American and Asian print businesses of AGI Global Holdings Co�peratief U.A. and AGI Shorewood Group, US Holdings, LLC (collectively, "ASG"). The acquisition of ASG, a manufacturer of print and packaging in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China, expands our global network and customer base. ASG had annual sales of approximately $350 million for the twelve months ending immediately prior to the date of the acquisition.  Acquisition of Presentation Products  On February 28, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Presentation Products ("Presentation"). The acquisition of Presentation complements the Company's previously acquired rigid packaging operations. Presentation is a rigid specialty box manufacturer located in the United Kingdom and has import and China sourcing offices located in Hong Kong, China. Presentation specializes in high end consumer packaging with an emphasis in the spirits market. Presentation had annual sales of approximately $42 million for the twelve months ending immediately prior to the date of the acquisition.  Acquisition of BP Media  On July 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of BP Media, Ltd. ("BluePrint"). The acquisition of BluePrint provides us with pre-press and digital services in the European market, facilitating the processes surrounding translation and interchangeability of print content for foreign locations. In addition, BluePrint provides us with an established sales presence in the media markets in Europe which will enable us to serve the European needs of global media releases. BluePrint had annual sales of approximately $23 million for the twelve months immediately prior to the date of acquisition.  Table of Contents  Acquisition of Chicago Paper Tube and Can  On January 26, 2016 we completed the acquisition of Chicago Paper Tube and Can ("CPT"). CPT provides the Company with high end round rigid packaging capability in North America. CPT had annual sales of approximately $5 million for the twelve months immediately prior to the date of acquisition.  Acquisition Accounting  All of the transactions described above were accounted for as a purchase business combination. Accordingly, in all cases the assets and liabilities of the acquired or merged entities were recorded at fair value as of the respective closing dates and the results of operations of the entities are included in our results of operations from the date of closing.  Reorganizations/Restructuring  The Company announced the closure of the former ASG facility located in Melrose Park, Illinois on September 1, 2015, with an anticipated completion date of February 2016. The Company recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $2.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to the announced closure. The underlying facility is leased on a month-to-month basis. In addition to the restructuring expense recorded in September, the Company incurred duplicative costs associated with the transfer of Melrose Park work to other facilities, and as such recorded incremental restructuring expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $0.8 million.  Trends  General Information  Our largest customers are generally large multinational entities, many of which are consolidating global packaging requirements under a smaller number of suppliers. We believe we are favorably situated for this transition due to our many facilities, global footprint, standardized equipment from plant to plant and our relative size to other packaging suppliers. The packaging marketplace is very fragmented, with no one vendor providing a significant portion of the packaging needs.  Net Sales Trends  Net sales are impacted by the macroeconomic performance of our geographic segments and the markets within these geographic segments. Packaging net sales tend to be strongest just before the underlying customer's busy season, which for high-end branded products is generally strongest in our first and second fiscal quarters.  Healthcare net sales in each of our geographic segments are influenced by the severity of a particular region's cold and flu seasons, as well as the development and acceptance of certain new products, and the stage of product, from the prescription-only stage to the private label or generic stage.  European consumer net sales of confectionary products are generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season. North American and European consumer net sales of spirits are also generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season. Asia consumer net sales of spirits are generally stronger in their holiday season, generally in our third fiscal quarter.  The net sales to the North American multi-media end market are influenced by the success of a particular year's movie releases, which can generate special packaging needs for these customers. Net sales of packaging in the North American video game market are generally influenced by the age of existing, and introduction of new, gaming platforms. Product launches, which cannot be predicted far in advance, have an impact on net sales, particularly with respect to special packaging needed for the holiday season. Overall, we expect our multi-media net sales to continue to decline as a percentage of our total net sales.  Impact of Inflation and Pricing  We have not historically been and do not expect to be significantly impacted by inflation. Increases in payroll costs and any increases in raw material costs that we have encountered are generally able to be offset through lean manufacturing activities. We have consistently made annual investments in capital that deliver efficiencies and cost savings. The benefits of these efforts generally offset the margin impact of competitive pricing conditions in all of the markets we serve.  We remain sensitive to price competitiveness in the markets that we serve and in the areas that are targeted for growth, and believe that the installation of state-of-the-art printing and manufacturing equipment as well as utilization of lean manufacturing (and related labor and production efficiencies) will enable us to compete effectively.  Table of Contents  Operational Restructurings  We regularly evaluate our operating facilities in our geographic segments in order to determine how to allocate our resources, share best practices, ensure logistics that serve customers are appropriate and maximize our operating efficiencies. In connection with these evaluations, we have closed certain facilities in recent periods.  Results of Operations Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Quarter Ended December 31, 2014. The table below presents our results of operations for the respective quarters: Three Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2015 2014 Net sales $ 429,357 $ 404,827 Cost of goods sold 333,632 322,493 Gross margin 95,725 82,334 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling general and administrative expenses 59,306 61,955 Stock based and deferred compensation expense 27,232 455 Transaction and other related expenses 2,064 3,463 Operating income 7,123 16,461 Other income (expense) Other income (expense) net 100 (1,776 ) Debt extinguishment charges (3,867 ) - Interest expense (16,016 ) (17,871 ) Total other expense, net (19,783 ) (19,647 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (12,660 ) (3,186 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (4,656 ) (791 ) Net income (loss) (8,004 ) (2,395 ) Less: income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest (87 ) 37 Net income (loss) attributable to Company $ (7,917 ) $ (2,432 )  Net Sales  The increase in net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $24.5 million, or 6.1%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase is due to the inclusion of sales from the acquired operations of ASG, Presentation Products and BP Media, which were acquired in November 2014, February 2015 and July 2015, respectively. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency changes, principally from translation differences, of approximately $23.6 million.  Net sales adjusted for the acquisitions had they been included since the beginning of the period, were $478.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, a difference of $49.2 million from the GAAP net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The difference is primarily attributable to the foreign exchange impact noted previously, as well as a reduction in general multi-media sales of $16.5 million and a decline in two consumer products companies' sales of approximately $7.9 million.  Table of Contents  We operate our business along the following operating segments, which are grouped based on the basis of geographic region: North America, Europe, and Asia. Net sales by geographic segment, as further broken down by end market, are summarized as follows:  Net Sales by Geographic Segment Three months ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2015 2014 North America Healthcare $ 67,259 $ 63,011 Consumer 88,297 71,237 Multi-media 45,889 44,672 $ 201,445 $ 178,920 Europe Healthcare $ 77,761 $ 88,117 Consumer 116,545 123,431 Multi-media 6,665 2,555 $ 200,971 $ 214,103 Asia Healthcare $ 5,034 $ 4,819 Consumer 21,907 6,985 $ 26,941 $ 11,804 Total $ 429,357 $ 404,827  The acquisition of ASG in November 2014 increased consumer, healthcare and multi-media sales due to that acquisition serving those end markets. All industry sales were higher due to the ASG acquisition; however overall sales trends in multi-media are expected to continue to decline and absent the acquisition activity, would have declined. Multi-media sales are declining due to the change in delivery systems towards digital delivery via downloads or online and pay-per-view systems. Our sales are reflective of the overall trend in the multi-media end market. Sales related to acquired businesses are evaluated as to profitability and optimization of manufacturing facility and if they are core to the Company's ongoing business strategy. As a result, the Company can exit business that was not profitable or core to its business, and can move manufacturing to facilities that optimize the manufacturing effectiveness.  North America  The increase in North American net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $22.5 million or 12.6%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase in North American healthcare sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $4.2 million, or 6.7%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase in North American consumer net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $17.1 million or 24.0%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase in North American multi-media sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, was $1.2 million or 2.7%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. All of these increases are primarily a result of the ASG acquisition completed on November 21, 2014. ASG had a majority of its business operations in North America.  Adjusted for acquisitions in fiscal 2015 North American sales were $201.4 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 compared to $222.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is principally due to the previously mentioned consumer product companies' sales and negative foreign exchange of approximately $3.9 million.  Although North American multi-media sales increased for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 by $1.2 million, this increase was principally due to the inclusion of the sales from the acquired ASG operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The acquired ASG operations were integrated immediately upon acquisition and, as a result, it is not possible to isolate the portion of revenues attributable to the ASG operations. However, had the ASG acquisition not occurred, multi-media sales would have declined for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  Table of Contents  Europe  The decrease in Europe net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $13.1 million, or 6.1%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014, principally due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $18.9 million offset by the sales from the BP Media and Presentation Products acquisitions completed on July 1, 2015 and February 28, 2015, respectively.  The decrease in Europe healthcare sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $10.4 million, or 11.8%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, European health care sales remained relatively flat. The decrease in Europe consumer net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $6.9 million, or 5.6%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and is due to negative foreign exchange impacts. Before foreign exchange, consumer increased primarily due to the acquisition of BP Media and Presentation Products, offset by a reduction in sales associated with tobacco companies due to the impact of tobacco legislation in Europe. The Company does not have nor expect to have significant sales to tobacco customers in the future. The increase in Europe multi-media net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $4.1 million, or 160.9%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the BP Media acquisition. Adjusted for acquisitions in fiscal 2015 European sales were $201.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 compared to $230.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.3 million. The decrease is principally from the impact of foreign exchange.  Asia  The increase in Asia net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $15.1 million, or 128.2%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The largest impact on sales is due to the acquisition of ASG in November 2014 and the inclusion of its sales for the quarter.  The increase in Asia healthcare sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $0.2 million, or 4.5%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase in Asia consumer sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $14.9 million, or 213.6%, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014.  Adjusted for acquisitions in fiscal 2015 Asian sales were $26.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.7 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.2 million.  Gross Profit Quarter ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2015 2014 Net Sales $ 429,357 $ 404,827 Cost of Goods Sold 333,632 322,493 Gross Margin 95,725 82,334 Gross Margin % 22.3 % 20.3 %  The gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased when compared to the gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 principally due to the favorable impact of integration programs and synergies realized from the merger with Chesapeake and the acquisition of ASG in November 2014. Gross margin percentage for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was 22.3%, an increase of 200 basis points compared to 20.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The increase is reflecting the Company's continuing facility improvement programs and realized synergies from acquisitions, offset by restructuring charges and plant closure.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $88.6 million, an increase of $22.7 million when compared to the prior period. The increase is principally due to stock compensation charges recorded in the quarter of $26.9 million associated with the vesting of incentive units held by employees at the date of the Company's initial public offering, offset by a reduction in transaction related expenses of approximately $1.4 million. Other than stock based and deferred compensation, and transaction related expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $59.3 million, a decrease of $2.6 million when compared to the prior period.

The skills required to be successful in a warehouse are diverse, complex, and broad
Today's supply chains are more dynamic than ever. And finding the right talent is difficult. This, combined with the current market situation, has created demand for expertise that has resulted in shortages across the board in every warehouse skill set including drivers, technicians, mechanics, and first/mid-level managers.
Despite the challenge, driving efficiency is still a critical priority. Having an employee talent strategy is key. One strategy helping some companies is outsourcing non-core activities. Outsourcing can provide a unique opportunity to streamline operations, control costs and improve customer service – and free up time and resources for your business.
Everyday, Ryder customers around the world run LEANer, improve process efficiencies and spend more time growing their businesses than running them. As a strategic partner, Ryder does more than just connect the dots. We provide comprehensive transportation, distribution management and supply chain management to make your business run ever better.

Optimize Your Transportation Network

FIND OUT NOW
















Constantly changing market conditions and a shrinking driver pool may require an integrated transportation model.
A strong reliable transportation network can make or break your go-to- market plan. Customers’ expectations grow more complex every year and competition is ready and waiting. Along with customer demand, businesses have seen freight rates increase as high as 13 percent in the past year. This combined with changing federal safety regulations and a driver shortage pose a significant challenge for private fleets, dedicated fleets and companies that rely on common carriers for distribution of their products.
Keeping your options open and remaining flexible will go a long way in striking the right balance for your transportation network. What was once a single solution mind-set for transportation network success is becoming an “all-of-the-above” integrated approach.

DOWNLOAD NOW
 

 




You should balance your transportation network:





76%
of companies use common carriers AND dedicated fleet vehicles




53%
of companies do NOT use a routing tool




27%
of companies do NOT have a process to assign shipments











Download the Transportation Network Optimization Report to help you evaluate your business and consider if it’s time to adjust your transportation mix.
If you are seeking the right balance of fleet and common carriers, and trying to figure out how to maximize use of all open lanes, you will need visibility into your transportation network. Through an analysis of your entire transportation network, Ryder can provide the right balance between dedicated or private fleet and for-hire carriers to right size your fleet.
