Capitol Broadcasting Company Partners with Share Rocket to Expand their Social Performance



Share Article

















Leading broadcaster adopts Share Rocket social media ratings solution to monitor Raleigh media market.







"Share Rocket is one that allows us to make quick editorial decisions about content, informs our tactics on a minute-by-minute basis, and helped to dial in our overall strategy"


Dallas, Texas (PRWEB)
September 22, 2015
 Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC) has partnered with Share Rocket, Inc. to measure and expand its social media performance in the Raleigh, NC media market.
Share Rocket, a social media ratings service, has devised a proprietary social scoring/rating methodology for broadcasters and digital publishers with the aim of improving overall social equity for their clients. 
CBC implemented the Share Rocket service in May of this year on WRAL-TV and saw immediate improvement in their overall social media performance in the Raleigh TV marketplace.  Within the first month, WRAL experienced a 61% jump in Social Engagement and a 41% increase in both Social Share and Social Equity Index (SEI) scores.   
These results led CBC to implement the Share Rocket service for their Raleigh, NC Radio properties as well.
According to a recent survey of Broadcast Creative Service Directors and Promotional Managers performed by TVNewsCheck (June 24, 2015), social media has become the No. 1 outside medium in terms of effectiveness in promoting their News product and there have been numerous studies showing the impact of social on TV viewership. Additionally, social media platforms typically account for 40% to 60% of referral traffic on local TV digital properties, which is a growing source of revenue for broadcasters. For these reasons, social media is becoming an integral strategic platform for broadcasters and digital publishers. 
“Share Rocket is proud to partner with a broadcaster that is so well respected and innovative such as CBC” said CEO and founder of Share Rocket, Chris Kraft, “the Capitol team really understands how to leverage the Share Rocket platform to change the behavior of their on-air team and we are excited to be working with them to monitor their TV and Radio assets and helping them win in social.”
“Among the many social media tools we use to grow, engage and measure our audience, Share Rocket is one that allows us to make quick editorial decisions about content, informs our tactics on a minute-by-minute basis, and helped to dial in our overall strategy. It’s a tool that’s easily implemented,” says WRAL Creative Director, Shelly Leslie.” 
About Share Rocket: Share Rocket is a social media ratings and audience platform providing broadcasters and digital publishers an easy way to quantify their social media equity, benchmarked against their peers, Share Rocket provides market intelligence and actionable insights that drives social media success
About CBC: Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc. is a diversified communications company which owns and/or operates WRAL-TV, WRAL Digital, WRAZ-TV, WRAZ Digital, WRAL-FM, WRAL-HD2, WCMC-FM, WCMC-HD1, WDNC-AM, WCMC-HD2, WCMC-HD3, WCLY-AM, WCMC-HD4, Microspace, CBC New Media Group and Wolfpack Sports Properties (a joint venture with Learfield Sports) in Raleigh, NC; WILM-TV, WILT-LD and Sunrise Broadcasting in Wilmington, NC; The Durham Bulls Baseball Club in Durham, NC; and real estate interests including the American Tobacco Project and Diamond View office buildings in Durham, NC.
