Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping.

Producing Coal for Domestic and Global Markets












About
We not only believe in the future of coal, we’re building it.






Foresight Energy is a leading producer of thermal coal with reserves in the Illinois Basin. With over 3 billion tons of coal reserves, we believe we are among the largest holders of coal reserves in the United States. Our reserves are sufficient to support over 100 years of production at our current production level.
We operate three of our four mining complexes with longwall mining systems. This highly productive mining method coupled with the favorable geology of our coal has resulted in our mines being among the safest, most productive and lowest cost underground coal mines in the United States.
Our four mining complexes (Williamson, Sugar Camp, Hillsboro, and Macoupin) are designed to support up to 9 longwall mining systems, with a combined productive capacity of up to 71.5 million tons of high Btu coal per year.
Our reserves and mines are strategically located near multiple rail and river transportation access points giving us multiple transportation options. Our access to competing rail carriers as well as access to truck and barge transport provides us with cost-competitive flexibility. We own a 20 million ton per year barge-loading river terminal on the Ohio River. We have contractual rights to 5 million tons per year of existing terminal capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. These facilities have long-term, fixed price rail contracts ensuring our cost effective access to the export markets.
Our low operating costs, competitive transportation rates and high heat content of our coal enable us to be cost competitive on a delivered cost per Btu to a wide variety of domestic and international markets. We have been exporting coal through New Orleans since 2008 to Europe, South America, India and China.

Founder’s History
Chris Cline launched his career in the coal industry in 1980 at the age of 22. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father before him, he began working as an underground coal miner in southern West Virginia. He quickly moved into management, where he learned to use unique tools to motivate his workforce to develop and run low-cost coal mining operations. Working proactively with union and union-free operations, Chris Cline’s successes attracted the notice of major coal companies who engaged him to provide contract mining services for their own mines.
In 1985 as his market knowledge deepened and he developed a reputation as a low-cost coal producer, Chris moved his company from its contract mining roots toward developing and operating its own mines, preparation plants, loading docks and coal sales arms. Chris formed his energy development group, the Cline Group, in 1990, and through his front-line experience in each of these disciplines, his proactive approach to mine development and the strength of his workforce and management team, he was able to capitalize on opportunities others missed. The Cline Group was soon recognized across the industry as a reliable coal supplier, an excellent lessee, and a desired employer committed to the health and safety of its miners — characteristics that continue to drive its success today.
Over the next decade, the Cline Group developed and operated some of the most productive underground coal mines in the country. Its operations in the Appalachian region placed the company among the top 20 coal producers in the United States, with an annual production capacity of approximately 10 million tons. In 2003, the Cline Group sold its mature mining and processing concerns in Appalachia, and concentrated on developing new opportunities in the coal sector.
Faced with rising mining costs and depleted coal reserves in the Appalachian region, the Cline Group shifted its focus to the plentiful coal reserves in the Illinois Basin. The company began acquiring reserves there in 2005, in anticipation of a renewed interest in high sulfur, high Btu coal. Foresight Energy LLC was formed in 2006 to develop and operate the company’s Illinois mining assets. Since that time, Foresight Energy has progressed from undeveloped reserves with zero production to four producing coal mining complexes in central and southern Illinois and a high-volume coal transloading facility on the Ohio River in Indiana and short-haul railroad lines to increase flexibility.

Company History
When our principal owner, Chris Cline began acquiring Illinois Basin coal reserves in anticipation of renewed interest in high sulfur, high BTU coal he was sure the reserves would be mined someday, perhaps by his grandchildren.
That day came earlier than expected. In 2004 he began permitting the Pond Creek Mine in Williamson County, Illinois. Chris brought Pete Hendrick and his Mach Mining team to Illinois to develop this project. Construction at the mine commenced in early 2005 and the slope construction began in July of that year. Slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately 450 feet in mid-2006 and, following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in November 2006. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2008.
With the successful development and startup of the longwall at Pond Creek, planning began for similar longwall mining operations on other reserve locations controlled by Foresight Energy in Franklin County, Illinois, about 12 miles north of Pond Creek. Development of the slope and surface facilities at the MC# 1 Mine began in October 2008. The slope reached the coal seam in January 2010 and first coal shipments occurred in late August 2010. The longwall system began production in the first quarter of 2012.
In January 2009, Cline acquired coal mining assets in Macoupin County, Illinois from ExxonMobil Coal USA. Following the acquisition from Exxon, Macoupin recovered underground equipment, power lines, water pipe, conveyor belt and structure from the prior mine works. Macoupin then sealed off the majority of the previously mined areas of the mine to reduce the size of the underground area it needed to maintain and essentially created a new underground mine. The surface facilities were also upgraded including the rehabilitation of the preparation plant. Coal production began in the third quarter of 2009 with a single continuous miner super-section utilizing battery powered coal haulers. An additional continuous miner unit was added in January 2011 using a Flexible Conveyor Train system instead of coal haulers.
Construction at the fourth mining complex, the Deer Run Mine in Montgomery County, Illinois began in May 2009. Its slope reached the coal seam in November 2010 and initial coal shipments began in October 2011. Its first longwall mining system started in September 2012.
Other infrastructure to support these four mining complexes was built during this time including nearly 75 miles of rail spurs and rail loading facilities. In April 2012 the 25 million tons per year Sitran barge loading terminal on the Ohio River commenced operations.
On June 23, 2014, Foresight Energy LP completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.  On April 16, 2015, Murray Energy acquired a significant economic interest in Foresight.  On March 27 and 28, 2017, Murray Energy acquired additional interests in Foresight, as further outlined in our public disclosures.

Serving the Communities that Support Our Success
Because we operate where our employees, vendor and customers live, we believe it is important to take an active role in supporting our local community.
Foresight has partnered with local schools to help improve the quality of life for their students; with programs such as the “weekend warrior” food bags to ensure that elementary school children receive adequate nutrition when not in school. We also sponsored weekly programs to provide children with fresh fruit. To ensure that children are prepared for Illinois’ harsh weather, we have donated winter clothing to local elementary schools. In addition, we have sponsored reward programs for local honor students, established reader libraries and provided funding for updated textbooks.
Last winter, Foresight supported several families through St. Louis Crisis Nursery by purchasing needed items for them to have a wonderful holiday. Additionally, we raised and contributed money to assist St. Louis Crisis Nursery in furthering its mission.
To promote community health, safety and spirit, we have funded renovations for local sport facilities and have sponsored teams allowing local youth to participate in baseball, basketball, football, hockey, softball and track. We regularly donate to area hospitals and hospice facilities. Also, we have provided financial support and equipment to local fire departments. And we continue to support the local work of such respected organizations as the YMCA, Big Brothers Big Sisters, the United Way, the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association.
Foresight Energy is also dedicated to improving higher education in mining. We’ve funded significant improvements in the Coal Mining Technology Department at Rend Lake College in Ina, Illinois, and established a scholarship program for mining engineering students through the Illinois Mining Institute. We also sponsor an internship program to provide mining engineering students with a chance to supplement their education with on-the-job training.

Safety | Foresight Energy







































 











Producing Coal for Domestic and Global Markets














Foresight is fully committed to the health and safety of our miners. Safety is of paramount importance not only because it ensures the health and welfare of our workforce, but also because placing a high priority on safety is good business.
Our management team shares the belief that a workplace that stresses careful compliance with safe working practices leads to compliance with other important areas such as operational methodologies, roof control, housekeeping, and equipment maintenance.
Our success has been recognized with various safety and mine rescue awards. Most recently, one of our mines earned the “Best Safety Frequency Award for Division 2 Mines”. Our emphasis on mine rescue operations has led to the training of over 125 of our miners in fire training for underground mines and preparation plants. This means that 1 in every 8 of our miners is trained to deal with fire emergencies.
We have developed several innovative techniques to protect our mines and prevent injuries.
For example, we developed a roof control practice that attaches industrial-grade steel mesh to the roof of our mine entries utilizing a heavy-duty steel angle bracket. The mesh prevents loose rock or roof material from dislodging and potentially striking a miner.  The angle bracket provides extraordinary support to the protective mesh by anchoring into the roof as well as the coal rib.
Another example involves the operator compartment in our shuttle cars. We believe we are the only coal operator in the US that has integrated an enclosed and air conditioned operator cab for all shuttle cars.. The protected environment helps shield the operator from both striking hazards and dust.

A third example of our commitment to a safe working environment involves our investment in a portable rescue capsule. While not required by any rule, regulation or law, we recognized that an emergency situation could develop in the future where conventional primary and secondary access to one of our mines becomes blocked. In this event, the ability to quickly provide alternative access could be critical. For that reason, we own a portable drill. The Atlas Copco RD-20 drill is capable of drilling a 40 inch diameter hole to a maximum depth of 1,000 feet, which can reach the depth of all our mines.
Once the hole from the surface to the coal seam is complete we have a self-contained, truck mounted, electric escape hoist that can be used to extract trapped miners. The hoist is capable of reaching a depth of 1,000 feet and is equipped with a VFD drive to reach speeds of 246 feet per minute. The mobile unit is equipped with both a 26″ diameter and a 22″ diameter escape pod. The rescue capsule would be lowered into the coal mine to allow each trapped miner to be raised to the surface.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
