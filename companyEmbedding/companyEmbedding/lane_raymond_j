Early life and education[edit]
Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]
Career[edit]
IBM[edit]
Shortly after graduating, Lane was recruited to IBM's data processing division for a sales position.[2][9] In 1969, Lane was drafted to the U.S. Army, assigned to the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Because of his computer knowledge, he was made a systems analyst responsible for logistical computer systems. He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]
In 2000, Lane accepted a position with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8][9] Lane's work at KPCB centered on enterprise technology and alternative energy.[8][22] As of 2013 Lane became partner emeritus of Kleiner Perkins.[8] He serves as chairman of the board of Elance, a online staffing platform, and of Aquion Energy.[23]
HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
Lane has three children, Kristi, Kelley, and Kari, with his first wife, Donna.[9] He is married to Stephanie (Herle) Lane, with whom he has two children, Raymond Jay Lane III ("RJay") and Catherine Victoria ("Tori").[9][10][32]
Lane's philanthropic interests include work in higher education, the Special Olympics, and Cancer Research.[33]
Lane serves as the chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.[1][34][35] He led the institution's capital campaign and efforts to establish a Silicon Valley campus in 2002.[1] In 2010, the Lanes funded the Carnegie Mellon's Computational Biology program (The Lane Center for Computational Biology), which is the Computational Biology Department, one of six degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science.[10][36] In 2015, the Lane Center for Computational Cancer Research was established within the department. Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]
Ray and Stephanie Lane are contributors to the American Cancer Society, and sponsor functions to raise additional funds.[10][40] The Lanes initiated and funded the Stephanie H. Lane Cancer Research Network, a central service in the state of California to help cancer patients get information and treatment.[10][39]

Early life and education[edit]
Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]
Career[edit]
IBM[edit]
Shortly after graduating, Lane was recruited to IBM's data processing division for a sales position.[2][9] In 1969, Lane was drafted to the U.S. Army, assigned to the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Because of his computer knowledge, he was made a systems analyst responsible for logistical computer systems. He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]
In 2000, Lane accepted a position with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8][9] Lane's work at KPCB centered on enterprise technology and alternative energy.[8][22] As of 2013 Lane became partner emeritus of Kleiner Perkins.[8] He serves as chairman of the board of Elance, a online staffing platform, and of Aquion Energy.[23]
HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
Lane has three children, Kristi, Kelley, and Kari, with his first wife, Donna.[9] He is married to Stephanie (Herle) Lane, with whom he has two children, Raymond Jay Lane III ("RJay") and Catherine Victoria ("Tori").[9][10][32]
Lane's philanthropic interests include work in higher education, the Special Olympics, and Cancer Research.[33]
Lane serves as the chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.[1][34][35] He led the institution's capital campaign and efforts to establish a Silicon Valley campus in 2002.[1] In 2010, the Lanes funded the Carnegie Mellon's Computational Biology program (The Lane Center for Computational Biology), which is the Computational Biology Department, one of six degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science.[10][36] In 2015, the Lane Center for Computational Cancer Research was established within the department. Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]
Ray and Stephanie Lane are contributors to the American Cancer Society, and sponsor functions to raise additional funds.[10][40] The Lanes initiated and funded the Stephanie H. Lane Cancer Research Network, a central service in the state of California to help cancer patients get information and treatment.[10][39]

Early life and education[edit]
Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]
Career[edit]
IBM[edit]
Shortly after graduating, Lane was recruited to IBM's data processing division for a sales position.[2][9] In 1969, Lane was drafted to the U.S. Army, assigned to the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Because of his computer knowledge, he was made a systems analyst responsible for logistical computer systems. He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]
In 2000, Lane accepted a position with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8][9] Lane's work at KPCB centered on enterprise technology and alternative energy.[8][22] As of 2013 Lane became partner emeritus of Kleiner Perkins.[8] He serves as chairman of the board of Elance, a online staffing platform, and of Aquion Energy.[23]
HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
Lane has three children, Kristi, Kelley, and Kari, with his first wife, Donna.[9] He is married to Stephanie (Herle) Lane, with whom he has two children, Raymond Jay Lane III ("RJay") and Catherine Victoria ("Tori").[9][10][32]
Lane's philanthropic interests include work in higher education, the Special Olympics, and Cancer Research.[33]
Lane serves as the chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.[1][34][35] He led the institution's capital campaign and efforts to establish a Silicon Valley campus in 2002.[1] In 2010, the Lanes funded the Carnegie Mellon's Computational Biology program (The Lane Center for Computational Biology), which is the Computational Biology Department, one of six degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science.[10][36] In 2015, the Lane Center for Computational Cancer Research was established within the department. Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]
Ray and Stephanie Lane are contributors to the American Cancer Society, and sponsor functions to raise additional funds.[10][40] The Lanes initiated and funded the Stephanie H. Lane Cancer Research Network, a central service in the state of California to help cancer patients get information and treatment.[10][39]

Ray Lane is a Partner Emeritus at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Since joining the firm in 2000, he has focused on helping entrepreneurs with technological and market insight, organizational development, team building, selling and managing growth. Ray sponsored a number of investments for KPCB in enterprise technology and alternative energy. These investments include GreatPoint Energy (coal-to-gas conversion), Aquion (energy storage), Kenandy (cloud based MRP systems), Alert Enterprise (security convergence solutions), Vertica Systems (data warehousing solutions), Virsa Systems (financial systems compliance), Luca Technologies (biologically enhanced gas recovery from fossilized hydrocarbons), Fisker Automotive (extended range electric vehicle), Ausra (solar thermal concentrator) and Xsigo Systems (virtual I/O switch for datacenters). Ray also serves on the board of Hewlett-Packard and was its former Chairman. He presently serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.
Before joining KPCB, Ray was president and chief operating officer of Oracle Corp., one of the world’s largest software companies and a leading enterprise software and services company. During his eight-year tenure, Oracle exhibited phenomenal revenue growth from less than $1 billion in 1992 to more than $10 billion. Ray led Oracle’s business expansion beyond its core database technology into enterprise applications and professional services. Earlier in his career, Ray was a senior partner with Booz Allen Hamilton, where he pioneered and led the Information Systems Group, a worldwide consulting practice targeted at helping senior management achieve better results from information technology. He also served on Booz Allen Hamilton’s board of directors and executive management committee. Ray’s early career also included serving as division vice president with Electronic Data Systems Corp. and spending 10 years with IBM in various product-management, sales and marketing positions.
Ray received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and an honorary Ph.D. in science from West Virginia University. He was elected to the Academy of Distinguished Graduates of WVU, served as a director of the WVU Foundation Board, and presently serves on the university’s Board of Governors. WVU honored Ray by naming the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Ray also serves on the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University currently as its Chairman. He has been an active campaigner and planner for Carnegie Mellon’s establishment in 2002 of a Silicon Valley campus. He helped create and fund Carnegie Mellon’s Computational Biology Department, one of six permanent degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science. He serves as vice chairman of Special Olympics International and has served on the international board of Special Olympics for 15 years. He also holds an honorary Ph.D. from Golden Gate University.

Early life and education[edit]
Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]
Career[edit]
IBM[edit]
Shortly after graduating, Lane was recruited to IBM's data processing division for a sales position.[2][9] In 1969, Lane was drafted to the U.S. Army, assigned to the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Because of his computer knowledge, he was made a systems analyst responsible for logistical computer systems. He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]
In 2000, Lane accepted a position with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8][9] Lane's work at KPCB centered on enterprise technology and alternative energy.[8][22] As of 2013 Lane became partner emeritus of Kleiner Perkins.[8] He serves as chairman of the board of Elance, a online staffing platform, and of Aquion Energy.[23]
HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
Lane has three children, Kristi, Kelley, and Kari, with his first wife, Donna.[9] He is married to Stephanie (Herle) Lane, with whom he has two children, Raymond Jay Lane III ("RJay") and Catherine Victoria ("Tori").[9][10][32]
Lane's philanthropic interests include work in higher education, the Special Olympics, and Cancer Research.[33]
Lane serves as the chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.[1][34][35] He led the institution's capital campaign and efforts to establish a Silicon Valley campus in 2002.[1] In 2010, the Lanes funded the Carnegie Mellon's Computational Biology program (The Lane Center for Computational Biology), which is the Computational Biology Department, one of six degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science.[10][36] In 2015, the Lane Center for Computational Cancer Research was established within the department. Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]
Ray and Stephanie Lane are contributors to the American Cancer Society, and sponsor functions to raise additional funds.[10][40] The Lanes initiated and funded the Stephanie H. Lane Cancer Research Network, a central service in the state of California to help cancer patients get information and treatment.[10][39]
Recognition[edit]

Inducted into West Virginia University's Business Hall of Fame (2003) Academy of Distinguished Alumni (2004) and the Order of the Vandalia (2005).[11][41]

He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]

HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]

Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]

Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]

Early life and education[edit]
Raymond Jay Lane was born on December 26, 1946 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.[6][9] Lane grew up in rural western Pennsylvania where his father was employed as a design engineer for steel production plants.[2][9][10] Lane was heavily influenced by his father, who had emerged from the Depression-era steel business as the first member of his family to go to college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon as a mechanical engineer.[6][9]
Lane attended public schools, graduating from Moon High School in 1964.[9][10] Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lane first pursued a collegiate career in aeronautical engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).[9] He later changed his major and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968.[10][11]
Career[edit]
IBM[edit]
Shortly after graduating, Lane was recruited to IBM's data processing division for a sales position.[2][9] In 1969, Lane was drafted to the U.S. Army, assigned to the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Because of his computer knowledge, he was made a systems analyst responsible for logistical computer systems. He completed two years of military service and resumed his career in 1971 at IBM, achieving top sales awards for three years and being promoted to a product manager responsible for large mainframe and storage systems in one of IBM's largest regions.[9]
EDS[edit]
After eight years with IBM, Lane was recruited by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), led at the time by Ross Perot.[9] He was handed responsibility for a new division that provided services to large manufacturers, distributors, and retail and transportation companies.[12] Lane ran the nascent division for nearly four years.[9]
Booz Allen Hamilton[edit]
In 1981 Lane accepted a principal position with Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago.[13] At Booz Allen, he helped develop information technology strategies.[9] Lane became a partner in three years and a senior partner by 1986.[9][13] He led the development in the late 1980s of became known as Information Systems Group, one of two functional practices, and four industry practices that were the firm's primary organization.[14] He sat on the firm's executive committee and board of directors from 1987 to 1992.[15]
Oracle[edit]
In 1992, Lane was recruited by Oracle Corporation to turn around the firm's sales, service, consulting and marketing,[2] and named president of Oracle USA in June.[16] Oracle, suffering from rapid growth in the late '80s without checks and balances on its customer practices, was also falling behind technologically.[9] The rapid turnaround in the mid-90s, fueled by a new database technology, Oracle 7, and by Lane's organization of sales and services at the company, led to the rise of Oracle's business applications division.[9][13][16] Apple founder Steve Jobs recalled that "Larry told me that 15 minutes into the meeting, he knew Ray was the only guy he had met who was near smart enough to run Oracle."[2] In 1996, Lane was named the president and chief operating officer of Oracle.[9][17] Under his leadership, along with Larry Ellison and Jeff Henley, Oracle expanded from 7,500 to 40,000 employees, defeating its main database rivals Sybase and Informix, to become the leader in the database industry while building major businesses in ERP applications and consulting.[9][18][19][20] In mid-2000, Lane suddenly left the company, leading to speculation Oracle's business needs had outgrown him.[21]
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[edit]
In 2000, Lane accepted a position with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8][9] Lane's work at KPCB centered on enterprise technology and alternative energy.[8][22] As of 2013 Lane became partner emeritus of Kleiner Perkins.[8] He serves as chairman of the board of Elance, a online staffing platform, and of Aquion Energy.[23]
HP[edit]
Lane served as non-executive chairman on Hewlett-Packard's board of directors from 2010 to 2011, and as executive chairman from 2011 to 2013.[24][25] Lane restructured the board to add seven new directors, replaced the short-tenured CEO Leo Apotheker, and led the placement of Meg Whitman as CEO.[24][25][26] Lane was chairman when HP decided to acquire Autonomy Corporation, a controversial acquisition that led him to step down as chairman, but remain on the board of directors.[26]
Tax dispute[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Lane was involved in a personal tax dispute.[6] The case stemmed from a tax year 2000 audit that reviewed an investment in a tax strategy used by Lane's advisors called POPS (Partnership Option Portfolio Securities) to offset a minority of Lane's income.[6][7] Lane agreed to settle in excess of $100 million.[6][27][28]
On January 3, 2014 Lane filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, and BDO Seidman, LLP alleging that he had suffered damage as a result of their having designed an allegedly "fraudulent" tax shelter.[29][30][31]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
Lane has three children, Kristi, Kelley, and Kari, with his first wife, Donna.[9] He is married to Stephanie (Herle) Lane, with whom he has two children, Raymond Jay Lane III ("RJay") and Catherine Victoria ("Tori").[9][10][32]
Lane's philanthropic interests include work in higher education, the Special Olympics, and Cancer Research.[33]
Lane serves as the chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.[1][34][35] He led the institution's capital campaign and efforts to establish a Silicon Valley campus in 2002.[1] In 2010, the Lanes funded the Carnegie Mellon's Computational Biology program (The Lane Center for Computational Biology), which is the Computational Biology Department, one of six degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science.[10][36] In 2015, the Lane Center for Computational Cancer Research was established within the department. Lane also funded a professorship chair in his father's name held by Robert F. Murphy (computational biologist).[10][37] Additionally, he is a benefactor to his alma mater, West Virginia University, where he sits on its board of governors.[8] He chaired a WVU capital campaign in the early 2000s.[10] In September 2007, the Lanes made a $5 million contribution to the university's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs, for which the university honored them by naming the department The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.[10][36]
Lane has served as vice chairman of Special Olympics International for several years.[1][38] In October 2011, Ray and Stephanie funded the organization's international expansion project, Unify, which unites school age youth with intellectual disabilities with their healthy counterparts.[39]
Ray and Stephanie Lane are contributors to the American Cancer Society, and sponsor functions to raise additional funds.[10][40] The Lanes initiated and funded the Stephanie H. Lane Cancer Research Network, a central service in the state of California to help cancer patients get information and treatment.[10][39]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
