Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) is an American asset management and financial planning company founded in 1937. It has been a publicly traded company since 1998, and has its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. It operates asset management and distribution subsidiaries, including Ivy Investment Management Company and Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company.[1]
The company distributes products through three primary channels, the Advisors channel (a network of personal financial advisors around the country); the Wholesale channel (unaffilated broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and retirement platforms); and the Institutional channel (pension plans, defined benefit plans and endowments).
History[edit]
The company traces its history to September 3, 1937 when it was founded by Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed. The company was one of the first to sell funds following the Investment Company Act of 1940. Two of its funds—United Income Fund and United Accumulative Fund—were among the first mutual funds in the United States. Its first offices were in department stores. Continental Investment Corporation of Boston bought Waddell & Reed for $82.5 million in 1969. Liberty National Insurance Holding Company, later renamed Torchmark Corporation acquired it for $160 million in 1981.[2] Torchmark spun it off in 1998 in a deal where for 10 Torchmark shares held, Torchmark shareholders received 3 shares of Waddell & Reed.[3]

SEC-Required Report on Routing of Customer Orders
Waddell & Reed, Inc. ("W&R") introduces transactions on a fully disclosed basis to our clearing firm, Pershing LLC ("Pershing") . In November 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted new rules aimed at improving the quality and availability of disclosure related to order execution and routing practices. Pershing has prepared reports pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 606 that requires all brokerage firms to make publicly available quarterly reports on their order routing practices. The report provides information on the routing of "non-directed orders" - any order that the customer has not specifically instructed to be routed to a particular venue for execution. For these non-directed orders, our clearing firm has selected the execution venue on behalf of its customers.

The report is divided into four sections: one for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, one for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, one for securities listed on the American Stock Exchange or regional exchanges, and one for exchange-listed options. For each section, this report identifies the venues most often selected by the clearing firm, sets forth the percentage of various types of orders routed to the venues, and discusses the material aspects of the respective clearing firm's relationship with the venues. W&R directs its equity order flow to its clearing firm, Pershing, for routing and execution based upon where the customer's account is held. W&R does not receive compensation for directing order flow to Pershing.

Proxy Voting

Prior to the general meeting of a company or fund, shareholders will receive a package
in the mail containing a variety of documents that report financial data and operations
results and announce important issues - such as proposals for changes to the company's
share structure or mergers and acquisitions. These are all matters that shareholders
or unit holders, the true owners of the company or fund, will vote on at the general
meeting. If, however, a shareholder is not able to attend an annual (or special)
meeting, he or she can vote on proposals by means of a proxy, one of the documents
that is included in the pre-meeting mailing package. Shareholders are encouraged
to take advantage of their opportunity to influence the company and fund’s operations
by casting their vote.

*Eligible Rollover Distribution (ERD) refers to those distributions from Qualified Plans that are eligible to move between various fiduciary plan types (for example - 403(b), 401(k)) without tax consequences. These Qualified Plan types are referred to in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401(a) and include Profit Sharing, 401(k), Money Purchase Pension, Defined-Benefit, and ESOP. An ERD may also be from an IRC 403(b) (7) plan, which is for employees of non-profit institutions and public schools.
If an election is made to take an ERD from these plans in cash or "in kind" there is a mandatory 20% federal withholding. When this occurs, various states require withholding as indicated.

Traditional, Roth and rollover IRAs offer attractive tax advantages and can serve as primary or supplemental retirement savings vehicles.  




Traditional IRA



Invest in a traditional IRA and defer paying taxes until you make withdrawals in retirement. Why does deferral matter? Simply put, if you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, your tax savings could be significant when you withdraw the money. Learn more about the traditional IRA:


 Traditional IRA Flyer



Deferred taxes and tax deductions. In addition to deferring taxes on current investment income or appreciation, you may be able to deduct all or a portion of your annual contribution, depending on your adjusted gross income.
Contributions. If you are younger than 70½ in 2017 and have taxable compensation, you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. You also may contribute for a non-working or minimally working spouse. 
Reinvested earnings. All earnings from your traditional IRA are automatically reinvested into your account to maximize your total return.
Required withdrawals.  At age 70½, the IRS mandates that you begin taking an annual withdrawal called a required minimum distribution (RMD). Your Waddell & Reed financial advisor can assist you in calculating and understanding the RMD process.  



IRA vs. Taxable Account Comparison
Your IRA’s potential growth is tax deferred until withdrawn and can accumulate substantially faster than identical savings in a taxable account

This chart is for illustration purposes only and does not represent the past or future performance of any specific investment. This chart assumes the reinvestment of all earnings
and does not take into account any applicable fees, expenses, or possible withdrawals. The chart does not reflect all possible variables that may affect results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of state income taxes. Your situation may be different.

The assumed rate of return is not a guarantee, and investments that pay higher rates of return are generally subject to higher risk and volatility. Please note that lower minimum
tax rates on capital gains and dividends would make the investment return for the taxable investment more favorable and thus would reduce the difference in performance
between the accounts shown.

Investors should consider their personal investment horizon and income tax bracket, both current and anticipated, when making an investment decision, as these may further
impact the comparison.



Roth IRA



What are your tax expectations when you retire? If you think you will be taxed at a higher rate than today, think about saving for retirement with a Roth IRA. You'll make Roth contributions with money that has already been taxed at today's potentially lower rate. When you withdraw in retirement, your contributions and any potential growth may be tax free. That's one big reason to contribute. Other reasons the Roth IRA may be right for you include:


 Roth IRA Flyer



Contributions. You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you or your spouse have taxable income and your modified adjusted gross income is within the Roth limits. For 2017 you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.




Roth IRA Adjusted Gross Income Limits for 2017


Single, head of household
 $118,000-$133,000


Married filing jointly 
$186,000-$196,000


Married filing separately
 $10,000





Withdrawals. You can withdraw contributions for any reason at any time without taxes or penalties. However, request a withdrawal before your account is at least five years old or if you are not yet 59½ and the earnings portion may be subject to a 10% penalty (exceptions apply). With a Roth, unlike the traditional IRA, the IRS does not mandate a required minimum distribution at age 70½.

Earn too much to contribute to a Roth IRA? Consider contributing to and converting a traditional IRA to a Roth. A Waddell & Reed financial advisor can explain the details and guide you in this decision. 



Rollover IRA



When you’re ready to retire or switch employers, don’t leave without thinking about the assets in your employer’s retirement plan. One option is to transfer them directly to a rollover IRA, where you may benefit from:


 Rollover IRA Flyer



Tax-deferred retirement savings. Defer taxes on earnings until withdrawn in retirement.
    
No current income taxes. Avoid current income taxes, including a mandatory 20% income tax withholding and possible 10% excise tax, when you rollover.
    
Withdrawal flexibility. Withdraw without tax penalties between ages 59 ½ and 70 ½. After 70 ½, the IRS mandates require minimum distributions based on your average life expectancy

Other options for your assets in a former employer's retirement plan include: 

Leave the assets in the plan
Keep/spend the assets
Receive the assets in a check and deposit them yourself in an IRA rollover
Transfer your assets directly into your new employer’s retirement plan

What you choose depends on your previous employer’s plan document, your specific needs and your tax advisor's guidance. 






Add an IRA to your retirement savings plan.

Important Information:
Early withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty if you take a distribution before reaching age 59½.

Is It Wise to Trade Your Pension for a Lump Sum?

Midyear Global Market Outlook 2017Market PerspectivesIt's not unusual for a new year to bring changes. But 2017 may be particularly noteworthy.








Perspectives





 



Investable Theme: Increasing web use in China


                                John Maxwell and Catherine Murray, portfolio managers of the International Core Equity strategy, believe an increase
in Chinese internet usage will benefit select companies that have dominant market share or are well positioned for
increased usage through their online platforms.
                            








 



A time to be selective in the energy sector


                                We believe a selective approach to the energy sector is important now, but do not advocate broad exposure across the industry in the current environment.
                            








 



Five reasons to choose energy in 2017


                                We think there are five key ideas to keep in mind as we enter 2017.
