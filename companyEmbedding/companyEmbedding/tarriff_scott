Good morning. My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to Eagle Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Today, March 8 (sic) [May 8], 2017.
It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Lisa Wilson. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Lisa Wilson
Thank you, Keith. Welcome to Eagle Pharmaceuticals' first quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Lisa Wilson, Investor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals.
With me on today's call are Scott Tarriff, Chief Executive Officer; and David Riggs, Chief Financial Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.
This morning, the Company issued a press release detailing financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This press release and a webcast of this call can be accessed through the Investors section of the Eagle Web site at eagleus.com.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that any statements made on today's call that express a belief, expectation, projection, forecast, anticipation or intent regarding future events and the Company's future performance may be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Eagle Pharmaceuticals management as of today, and involve risks and uncertainties including those noted in this morning's press release and our filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Eagle Pharmaceuticals specifically disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law.
A telephone replay will be available shortly after completion of this call. You’ll find the dial-in information in today's press release. The archived webcast will be available for one-year on our Web site, eagleus.com. For the benefit of those who may be listening to the replay or archived webcast, this call was held and recorded on May 8, 2017. Since then, Eagle may have made announcements related to the topics discussed, so please reference the Company's most recent press releases and SEC filings.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eagle's CEO, Scott Tarriff.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. So this was a record quarter for Eagle, driven by Bendeka and Ryanodex with sequential and year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We continue to pursue the strategy we outlined at year end, and the Company is committed to successfully execute on that strategy. I remain confident that this will be another transformative year for Eagle with ongoing progress.
Net revenue increased to $77 million, which continues to be driven by the growth in Bendeka, our bendamustine hydrochloride injectable marketed by Teva, which reached a record 95% market share, and of course Ryanodex sales. And we delivered another strong quarter of growth in net income with EPS of $1.42 per diluted share, while investing in our R&D programs and scaling our commercial organization to support the launch of Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke this year, if approved and advancing multiple additional development programs.

While we are not providing formal guidance for 2017, we believe that the full-year analyst estimates are consistent with our expected performance. That said, we are increasing our spend on additional R&D projects and product launch activities during the second quarter. Because of this investment, Q2 EPS will be lower than current analyst consensus.
The second quarter will also be the last quarter during which there will be an overlap between our third-party sales force licensing agreement and the growth in our own sales force as the licensing expenses will be eliminated in subsequent quarters. Importantly, our Q2 spend should have a positive impact in return on our business beginning in Q3 with our expected launch of Ryanodex, and continue for the remainder of 2017.
As part of our overall strategy and to maximize the value of our growing asset portfolio, we are advancing the development of our Ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication program and fulvestrant. And Adrian Hepner, our Chief Medical Officer and the Eagle team have made progress to prepare for the four clinical studies I mentioned on our Q4 call. Fulvestrant, Ecstasy, and methamphetamine intoxications, the third indication for Ryanodex, the lead product we are developing in conjunction with AMRI and a potentially fourth product to build our pipeline and secure the future of the Company.
We are now about 4.5 months through the year and Eagle is achieving the milestones we laid out on our year-end call. Let's review those and why we believe Eagle is poised for strong 2017. On a sequential basis, Bendeka royalties were up $5.7 million over Q4. We continue to see market share expansion for Bendeka, which grew to 95% as of the end of the first quarter and for which we now received a 25% royalty.
During the quarter, we extended the patent protection of our bendamustine portfolio with a total of eight newly issued patents. This brings the total number of issued patents to 14, of which 13 are orange book listed, and we remain committed to protecting the longevity of the product. We continue to make significant progress towards advancing our pipeline and launching Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke, if approved.
Let me first update you on our Ryanodex program. During the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone. The FDA granted priority review for the NDA we submitted for exertional heat stroke. EHS is a significant unmet medical need, many patients may have long-term neurological damage, organ damage, and [technical difficulty]. We are preparing for the launch of this important indication for which there is no approved drug treatment currently available.
With anticipated PDUFA date of July 23 of this year, we continue to align resources and plan for product launch. We're building a 50 person sales team to support the launch of EHS, if approved, all of which will be in place by the end of this month. This would be our first self launch product and the first of several labeled extensions we're exploring for Ryanodex.
We're obviously pleased with the $4.4 million in Q1 sales from our MH indication with the sales team of only 12. With the added internal sales strength and the anticipated second indication for Ryanodex, we expect our dantrolene sales to continue to grow in 2017.
We anticipate reaching several additional important achievements and milestones in 2017 based on what we laid out at year end. The clinical trial dosing for ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication indication, which we broadened to include severe organ dysfunction and damage following our pre-IND meeting with the FDA will begin shortly. We expect to start dosing our first subject next month. Currently, we consider this a Phase 2 study and we're starting to recruit now for it, but please note that this program may role into a pivotal Phase 3 study program. And we believe we can recruit all of the required patients over the next six months.

As everybody knows, we start building our Ryanodex acid with malignant hyperthermia, which is doing quite well. We're hopeful that these potential exciting indications will be meaningful to patients and to the Company. We are also currently working on a few new indications for Ryanodex, in addition to those that we’ve previously disclosed. The nature of these indications will provide us with additional near and mid-term opportunities, for which the market sizes are meaningful.
I would also note that we remain committed to further approvals and licensing agreements for Ryanodex ex-US. As you can see, we expect to continue expanding the value of Ryanodex by adding further indications and expanding our reach into new territories, all of which we will discuss in greater detail as the year progresses.
Our fulvestrant work continues. Fulvestrant is an exciting opportunity to improve patient care and could be a significant source of revenue for Eagle. We're recruiting sites and expect to dose our first patients within the next couple of months. We remain very excited about this opportunity. Fulvestrant could well be a $1 billion worldwide product by the time we come to market, representing a very meaningful opportunity for us going forward. Likewise, we see a potentially significant opportunity for our Pemetrexed formulation and await the FDA's decision in October of this year.
Turning to Eagle Biologics, we continue to evaluate opportunities in the space where we are developing innovative formulations of several significant Biologics. We believe that we have a strong platform from which to partner with e-biologic innovators and biosimilar companies to improve their existing pipelines into biobetters, enabling better patient friendly delivery of Biologics and potentially improving bioavailability. We will keep you apprised of developments with Eagle Biologics throughout the course of the year as well.
I'd like to end my prepared remarks by reminding everyone that we are committed to unlocking the full value of our growing portfolio of assets for the benefit of our patients, employees, and shareholders. We're implementing a strategy and action plan that positions us for a successful product launch this year with Ryanodex for EHS and a path forward for product introductions from our deep R&D pipeline. Our strong financial position ensures that we have the resources necessary to execute our strategy.
And with that, I'll turn our call over to David Riggs, our CFO to update you on our first quarter results. David?
David Riggs
Thank you, Scott. For the first quarter of 2017, our revenue totaled $76.8 million compared with $29.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The revenue mix consisted of product sales, royalty revenue, and license and other income.
Overall, total net product sales reflecting all Eagle products, increased $1.2 million to $15.3 million during the quarter, driven primarily by net sales of $4.1 million in Ryanodex and $7.6 million in Bendeka.
Royalty income increased to $36.5 million compared with $9.5 million during the first quarter of 2016, reflecting increased Bendeka sales and our royalty rate of 25% during the first quarter of '17 compared to 20% in Q1 of 2016 when Bendeka was first launched.
License and milestone income for the first quarter of 2017 were approximately $25 million milestone achieved upon Teva reaching $500 million in cumulative Bendeka sales. We feel confident in our ability to meet our top line goals for the year, keeping in mind that our revenue in 2017 will be largely impacted by Teva's marketing activities for Bendeka, the launch -- successful launch of Ryanodex for EHS and new opportunities that may go over the course of the year.
On the expense front, R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $7.5 million compared to $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. The $2 million increase is primarily due to the increase in spending for the manufacture of batches -- development batches for fulvestrant, which in part we plan to use for clinical testing later this year.

We continue to expect our R&D expense to be in the range of $31 million to $35 million this year, largely driven by our planned clinical studies. If we opt to run additional study during the year, R&D spend may increase.
SG&A was $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.7 million in the prior year quarter. Sales and marketing expenses and personnel related expenses grew in accordance with our prelaunch activities for Ryanodex, or EHS and accounted for $2.5 million of the increase for the quarter.
For 2017, we continue to expect SG&A to be in the range of $65 million to $68 million, a $13 million to $16 million increase for the year. We anticipate that a higher portion of our total operating expenses will be reflected during the second quarter of 2017 as we complete our obligations under the -- our agreement with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals that ends at the end of July. Prepare for the launch of Ryanodex for EHS at the end of July, if approved, and begin clinical trials for both fulvestrant and Ryanodex for meth and ecstasy intoxication.
We should see a more normalized level of spending in our operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters of the year. Earnings before taxes in the first quarter of 2017 were $32.7 million. Net tax expense for the quarter was $9.7 million, up 30% effective tax rate, which brings us to Q1 2017 net income of $22 million or $1.50 per basic and $1.42 per diluted share compared to net a net loss of $900,000 or $0.06 per basic and diluted share in Q1 of 2016.
As part of our stock repurchase plan, we purchased $13 million worth of our shares in the first quarter of 2017 and have now repurchased $51 million or 756,000 shares since the third quarter of 2016. We believe this reflects an effective use of our growing cash position and is in the best interest of shareholders.
We ended the first quarter of 2017 with a $27.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, an $84.7 million in net accounts receivable, $71 million of which was due from Teva. This represents an increase of $17.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and net accounts receivable compared to December 31, 2016. Company had no outstanding debt.
With that, I’d like to thank you for your continued support and open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead and open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Amsellem
Thanks. Just a couple. First, on Pemetrexed, on that product, my understanding is that you have yet to be or not been sued by Lilly here. So I wanted to get your thoughts on what to expect here going forward. Are you going to be in a position to launch shortly after approval if assuming that it is a timely approval and how should we think about what your strategy is there and what your thoughts are on the competitive dynamics there?
Scott Tarriff
Thanks, David. Good to hear from you. So Pemetrexed as we mentioned, it’s filed, we have a PDUFA date at the end of October. And the best way to describe it is that we’re obviously doing everything we can to optimize the value of the asset. We really can't comment past this at this time and it's a fluid situation. Just keep in mind that it ebbs and flows and we're doing everything possible to find the appropriate value in the product.
David Amsellem
Okay. And then just as a follow-up, and this is on Ryanodex and I may have missed this early since I joined the call a little late, but can you talk about the study or the path forward in drug-induced hyperthermia. And can you just remind us when you think you’d be in a position or what’s the earliest timeline for when you think you'd be in a position to file the SNDA in that indication?

Scott Tarriff
Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, Ryanodex for amphetamine overdose, specifically ecstasy and meth is really pretty exciting. And so, what we commented here this morning is that we're getting ready to start dosing patients, probably have the first patient dose next month already. If all goes well, the expectation is that we will have the study completely recruited in the next six months, right. So that’s before this year, if all goes well, it will either be a Phase 2 study or a Phase 3 study, we will get back with the FDA and we will follow-up on the timelines after that. But what we're trying to do is have all the patients recruited now this year and then file as quickly as we possibly can after that.
David Amsellem
So just to be clear, as the FDA communicated to you that a single study in that indication would be sufficient for filing?
Scott Tarriff
Yes, at this point what transpired David is we had our pre-IND meeting with FDA. Obviously, we met with them. We brought into the view of what that clinical trial would look like. And now we’ve decided to go and recruit those patients. And now either via Phase 2 or pivotal study, we will start collecting the data. We will meet with them again and they will have a better answer for you, but we believe we have a very good handle on the situation. And we expect to have the study completely enrolled in a very reasonable amount of time.
David Amsellem
Okay. Thank you.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you very much.
Operator
We will take our next question from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Randall Stanicky
Great. Scott, I just have a couple. Can you first comment on what the specific pluses and minuses are of potentially having a new partner selling Bendeka, if Teva was to sell it to oncology business. And maybe walk through the contractual protections in the event of a change of control that you have there? And then I’ve a follow-up.
Scott Tarriff
Yes. Thanks, Randall. So look Teva is our partner for oncology for Bendeka. I don't know anything beyond that. They are doing an outstanding job obviously. Sure, we’re all very pleased with the fact that they reach 95% market share now and we can see the growth that we've had in our royalties at 25% level this year compared to last year and certainly last quarter. All I can remind everyone is that Bendeka is the largest product in that division, and I'm sure if they do divest, anyone who acquires it is going to be acquiring it largely for this wonderful asset that we’ve built.
So I’d imagine that anybody, if anybody took over that division, they would feel the same way about it. I'd also remind everyone that there are certain diligence items, if you will, in the contract that would require any potential future owner to live up to those same obligations. So, we’re not very concerned -- in fact, we’re not concerned at all. The product continues to do very well. Teva is putting significant amount of resource behind it and we have record 95% market share.
Randall Stanicky
Are those obligation related to selling and marketing spend or number of reps or a combination of both?
Scott Tarriff
It is a dollar amount.
Randall Stanicky
It is, okay. And then, my follow-up here is, can you just comment on the timeline as it currently stands on fulvestrant, if that's changed from we’ve previously talked about an April 2018 NDA filing time line and obviously priority review is important. And specifically, Scott, how many months is enough in terms of getting out ahead of generics and feeling like you can maximize that market opportunity?
Scott Tarriff
Yes, So look, Randall, good question. On fulvestrant, everything is on target. We're doing everything we can to get the product to the market in the timeframe that we've outlined. It's interesting question. It's obviously a growing product. It's -- we think it could be a billion dollar product worldwide by the time you get to '19. And let's remind everyone what we've done to the product, right. The current product has two very viscous castor oil based 5 ML injections that need to be injected over 1 to 2 minutes. Painful and with a warning attached to the product about -- associated with the number of sticks and the formulation, and here we come along hopefully, if we’re successful, and we cut the number of injections from 2 to 1. We reduced the volume from 10 ML to 5 ML, so we’ve reduced the volume in half.

Our IM injection should be no different amount of pain than a typical IM drug. And if we're correct, then we’re able to take the warning label out and receive a unique J-code, we really would have by far the better product in a very large market, better for patients and for the people that actually have to deliver the drug in colleges and oncology nurses. And so, even if the period of time, if we launched after generics or we launched before generics and generics eventually came to the market, I think based on all of that that I just described, this product should do extremely well regardless in a very significant market. And so, obviously, we're trying everything we can to get the product to the market prior to generics coming to the market, but even if we wound up being late, then we still think we have a very wonderful opportunity ahead of us.
Randall Stanicky
Do you think given the safety differentiation and potential lack of black box, do you think there's clinical support for Astra, assuming you are to partner with Astra, pulling the older version and promoting your improved version?
Scott Tarriff
Yes. There is no black box and its really impossible to predict, Randall. I think the point is that, if we were successful with the plan we've outlined, we certainly would have by far the better product on the market. And you can see, let's use Bendeka as an example, right. The products co-exist on the marketplace, but Bendeka is just such a better product than the old TREANDA, we’ve 95% share now. And so I think that you'll see a similar type of marketplace unfolding if we brought fulvestrant to the market with or without a partner. And so, if you continue to innovate and bring out the better products, I think the market just takes care of itself. And all the physicians that we've spoken to about the product and the research that we've done, we feel quite confident that people would far prefer to dispense the product that we've outlined than the current product that’s on the market.
Randall Stanicky
Okay. That’s great. Thanks, Scott.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Tim Lugo with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim Lugo
Thanks for the question. Just a follow-up on fulvestrant. Can you discuss the clinical program again? I'm not sure if I came on a little late, may be you discussed that earlier. How many patients, what’s the duration, and how long you’re going to be following outcomes to come up with enough safety events that would differentiate label?
Scott Tarriff
Yes. Thank you, Tim. So, as we stated those patients are going to start to be recruited very soon. And I don’t think it's going to take a unusual amount of time to get the product completely recruited. I would think it's in our plan from the time we start recruiting to the time we go through the 12 months of stability for the product. We should be able to recruit all of our patients at that point. There's probably about a 90-day follow-up after the last patient is recruited. And I don’t know, probably 100, 150 patients is what we're thinking at this point, all very achievable in the timeframe that we’ve laid out.
Tim Lugo
Okay, great. And for the additional candidates AMRI and the other can development. When do you think you’re going to disclose those?
Scott Tarriff
You know I think towards the end of the year, as the year rolls along, Tim, we will have more product information. Today on the call, I just spoke briefly about additional indications of Ryanodex that we haven't discussed yet, that could be extremely meaningful to us. And so, as the year goes by and as we have the discussions with the FDA, and as we have our patent situations in place, as we always do, we will speak a little bit more to you.

Tim Lugo
Okay. And for the exertional heat stroke indication, you’re going -- your PDUFA date is mid-Q3. Will we have to wait for Q4 to see a ramping in Ryanodex revenue?
Scott Tarriff
Well, we will have it launched on the day of the approval and we will start, the program. The 50 reps will be all be on board this month. They will be out promoting both MH and then upon approval EHS and we'll see those sales shortly after launch, and we will report back obviously as soon as we’re able to.
Tim Lugo
Okay. I guess for malignant hyperthermia, what do you think the percentage is the penetration now?
Scott Tarriff
What we have, well over a 1,000 hospitals now. Somewhere between a 1,000 I think and 1,200 or so. And if you think there are 5,000 hospitals, right, there's our market share and that’s with about right a dozen people moving up to 50 now. And the intent would be that with the additional salespeople, the MH indication should continue to grow and then assuming the EHS approval on time in July, we think we're positioned well with 50 people to hit the gates quickly, expanding the number of vials that 1,000 or 1,200 hospitals stock and then continuing to have new hospital stock to product in both the operating room and the emergency room.
Tim Lugo
Okay. And maybe a question for David. It looks like accounts receivable was up a bit, especially over your cash levels. Can you just talk about cash collections and how we should expect that the trend in the next couple of quarters?
David Riggs
Sure, Tim. Well, I think what I want to do is assure you that none of those receivables are late. We’ve been getting remittances mainly from Teva, our largest AR source, on a timely, regular basis and yes, they’re higher, but we did earn a $25 million milestone, which is in there. And there was some inventory replenishment that went into that bucket, along with just normal royalty revenue. So, not to worry, it's a higher balance, but it should work itself down in Q2.
Tim Lugo
Okay, great. And actually before I hop off, sorry for all the questions. The undisclosed candidate, is that part of the reserve folks down in Boston?
Scott Tarriff
No, no.
Tim Lugo
Okay. All right. Well, thanks a lot.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Tim.
Operator
And we will take our next question as a follow-up from Randall Stanicky. Please go ahead.
Randall Stanicky
Hey, Scott. Thanks. Just two quick follow-ups. First, on Pemetrexed, I'm not sure how much you’re able to comment, but as we get closer to PDUFA, if we don't see a settlement with Lilly, what legal or at risk launch options do you have, given that you haven't been sued, but that threat certainly could be lingering. And then, I just wanted to clarify on guidance. When you mentioned that your -- that your expected performance is consistent with the analysts 2017 forecast, are you talking about both revenue and EPS? Thanks.
Scott Tarriff
Yes. Thanks, Randall. To the Alimta question, we really can't comment any further. There's just so much activity that’s going to take place over the rest of the year on Alimta. It's just going to -- as I keep saying the ebb and flowing. If we have anything tangible that we can tell you, we will. We will just watch the situation. Just know that we are doing everything we can to find the appropriate value on that asset. And in terms of guidance, when we made that statement, we're thinking mostly about the EPS number. But you can see from Q1, our top line continues to do rather well. We had a very good first quarter and 4.5 months for the year we're very pleased with the way the business is running from a commercial standpoint. David Pernock is here in the room with me right now and he's just been doing an outstanding job of preparing for the launch and bringing the sales forward on the product, so we do have in the market. So we just feel good about 2017 all the way around as we move forward.

Randall Stanicky
Great. Thanks again.
Operator
It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will return the floor to Scott Tarriff for any additional or closing remarks.
Scott Tarriff
Yes. Thank you, operator. Thank you everybody for being on the call. I know it's a bust day today. Really appreciate and hope to speak to everybody again shortly with more information. Thank you again.
Operator
And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eagle's CEO, Scott Tarriff.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. In 2016, we significantly enhanced Eagle’s long-term value. It was a transformative year and I’m pleased to report that we continue to see significant momentum in our business.
Our revenue grew 186% to 189.5 million and fully diluted EPS grew to $4.96 per share largely due to our ready-to-dilute bendamustine product, Bendeka. Launched in January of 2016 with our commercial partner Teva, Bendeka now commands a 92% share of the bendamustine market, exceeding our joint goal of 90%.
We are pleased with Teva’s ability to rapidly convert the market with Bendeka and expect it will continue and which will contribute significantly to our financial performance for many years to come, a driver of growth in 2017.

Earlier in the year, Teva provided Bendeka guidance of $600 million to $660 million for 2017, which did not include an increase in products. While their fourth quarter results were at the low end of the range from what we see so far this year, we are comfortable with their range and realize that we are only eight weeks into the quarter.
But as of today, Bendeka net sales during these first eight weeks are running ahead of the first eight weeks of last quarter. And don’t forget we have a full quarter of a 25% royalty compared to 20% last quarter.
In Q4 of last year, we received a $40 million milestone payment for the J-code and $29 million in royalty. This quarter, we have now qualified for a $25 million sales bonus triggered by cumulative Bendeka sales reaching $500 million since its launch.
To-date, we have earned a total of $110 million in milestones related to Bendeka. There is significant cash flowing to Eagle from this relationship and we’ll shortly discuss how we’ve elected to put our growing cash position to work, while we continue to focus on investing in our future.
With the CMS decision to issue unique J-code, which went into effect in January of this year, outpatient facilities and physicians that administer Bendeka now have reimbursement coding clarity which we believe will make it easier for patients to access the product and support further growth in market share.
This, combined with 14 issued or allowed patents protecting our Bendeka portfolio to-date, 11 of which have been issued, 10 of which are Orange Book listed and the successful outcome to a legal challenge to 1 of the 10, we believe the hurdle for any ANDA challenger is high.
And as we continue to file additional patents, the patent protections for the Bendeka family of products will continue to strengthen. Therefore, we expect a long life cycle for Bendeka supported by its multiple benefits to patients and providers and protected by a growing patent portfolio extending from 2026 through 2033.
We also made significant progress this past year to advance our pipeline. Our most significant near-term opportunity is in expanding the Ryanodex label to include indications for the treatment of exertional heat stroke and Ecstasy and metamfetamine intoxication.
As approved today, Ryanodex for malignant hyperthermia is a solid component of our portfolio. Our sales force of only about 12 people continues to increase Ryanodex’s share of the dantrolene market substantially. In 2016, sales increased 92% to 11.7 million compared to 2015.
Physicians understand this benefit in treating malignant hyperthermia which we believe will gain adoption of future Ryanodex indications if approved. We are confident in the growth of the molecule especially since we will be quadrupling our sales force from 12 reps to approximately 50 reps.
In January of this year, we completed the NDA submission for Ryanodex for EHS and we requested priority review for this severe and debilitating condition that can cause long-term neurological impairment and organ damage for which there is no approved drug treatment currently available. If grated, as anticipated, the PDUFA date for a decision on the NDA would be July of 2017, later this year.
If Ryanodex is approved for the treatment of EHS, we could be the first to market with a potentially transformational therapy for the treatment of EHS in emergency settings that ameliorate brain damage and organ impairment.
David Pernock will address our commercialization plans in more detail shortly. Remember, we believe EHS is significantly underreported and there may be approximately 75,000 cases of EHS annually in the United States.
Beyond EHS, we also made progress exploring the potential Ryanodex to treat Ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication. Clinical studies are currently underway at the NIH. In December, we had a positive pre-IND meeting with the FDA during which the FDA suggested broadening the indication to evaluate severe organ dysfunction and damage.

Planning and execution of a pilot clinical study is underway. We anticipate beginning a pilot study as soon as possible followed by a pivotal study starting in Q4 of this year. Both opportunities address debilitating conditions in sizable populations for who no drug treatment options are available today. We are pleased that we were able to reduce our royalty obligations for Ryanodex from 15% all the way down to 3%. This will enhance our future earnings on the product.
In 2016, we also acted to identify longer-term opportunities to replicate our successful product development and commercialization strategy. We are working on an innovative formulation of fulvestrant and are very proud of the work we are doing here. This is Eagle’s first product completely developed in-house, showcasing our formulation and clinical knowhow.
The currently marketed formulation requires two large IM injections to deliver the monthly recommended dose. It contains castor oil and a warning has been added to the label concerning painful injections, sciatica, neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy. The injections can last 1 to 2 minutes each.
Our unique formulation contains no castor oil and only requires one monthly injection allowing for alternating the injection site every month. Therefore, our belief is that we can eliminate the current warning in the label by conducting the appropriate clinical trial.
As a result of these improvements, we hope to achieve the unique J-code just like we did with Bendeka. We filed an NDA for our ready-to-use Pemetrexed in formulation in December which was just accepted for filing. It has a PDUFA target date of October 30 of this year.
Importantly, we also established a foothold in the biologics space with our acquisition of Arsia Therapeutics renamed now Eagle Biologics. Our plan to partner with key biologic innovators and biosimilar companies to improve their existing pipelines into biobetters. You will hear more about biologic strategy over the course of the year.
In addition to building our product portfolio, we are focused on optimizing our strong financial position. We acted to accelerate spend in R&D and SG&A during the fourth quarter where it made sense so that we would be better positioned for 2017 and '18.
At the end of 2016, cash and cash equivalents were 52.8 million, accounts receivable were 42.2 million. We remain debt free and we repurchased approximately $37 million of Eagle stock. And since commencing the program authorized in July of '16, Eagle has purchased more than 722,000 shares totaling approximately $48 million or over 4% of our stock.
To answer the question of what we are doing with our cash, we are accelerating our R&D where possible and buying back our stock. If our R&D continues to perform as it has, then our stock buyback will prove to be even more positive. We plan to remain focused on shareholder return and believe we have been very good stewards of our cash. Our average purchase price is slightly more than $66 per share and we are quite pleased with our investments.
I’d like to also mention that as Eagle builds an attractive portfolio of injectable assets that address a large market opportunity, we continue to strengthen our management team. I’m very pleased that David Pernock, a long-time business partner and friend and industry leader with exceptional commercial track record of bringing blockbuster drugs to the market, has transitioned from our Board of Directors to lead our commercial team as President and Chief Commercial Officer.
David has hired team members with extensive industry experience to assist in the launch of Eagle products. With Mike Moran and Sherry Korczynski reporting to David along with the extended team, I am very confident that Eagle will be well positioned to commercialize our products, beginning with Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke if approved.

As we move through the rest of the call, you’ll hear from David Riggs, our CFO about our performance last quarter and during the year including the accelerated and nonrecurring expenses in Q4 and expense guidance for 2017. David Pernock will then discuss the upcoming EHS launch and Adrian Hepner will discuss our clinical activities.
Before I turn the call over to them, let me leave you with a few thoughts about this year. We believe 2017 will be another transformative year for the company. We expect to have another strong quarter here in Q1. Bendeka royalties are running ahead of Q4 and we have earned a $25 million sales milestone this quarter.
We expect to have a 50-person sales team to support EHS if approved and other products as they become market ready. While our R&D focus in 2016 was on formulation development, we’re now shifting our R&D efforts to a clinical focus. Our in-house formulation team will continue to deliver results with the development of Pemetrexed and fulvestrant.
Adrian’s team is preparing to run up to four clinical studies this year as we continue to build our pipelines and secure our future. This includes fulvestrant, the Ecstasy and met intoxication as a third indication for Ryanodex, the lead product that we are developing in conjunction with AMRI and potentially a fourth study that you’ll learn about as the year progresses.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to David Riggs, our CFO, to update you on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. David?
David Riggs
Thank you, Scott. I’d like to start by pointing out that after we received the great news on the J-code for Bendeka, we were in the $40 million milestone, we decided to accelerate spending in both R&D projects and sales and marketing activities.
This spending amounted to approximately $15.6 million for the quarter and brought total operating expenses for the year up to our previously given expense guidance of $80 million to $84 million.
Now I’ll go into the detail. For the fourth quarter of 2016, our revenue totaled $81.1 million compared with $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The revenue mix consisted of product sales, royalty revenue and license and other income.
Overall, total product sales reflecting all Eagle products increased $6.2 million to $9.1 million during the quarter, driven by net sales of $3.9 million in Ryanodex, $1.7 million in Bendeka and $1.5 million in Docetaxel.
Royalty income increased to $32 million compared to $312,000 in Q4 '15 due to the launch of Bendeka. License and other income during the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to $40 million compared to $15 million in 2015, again due to Bendeka.
We received a $40 million milestone payment from Teva in Q4 of 2016 related to the new J-code and $15 million in Q4 of 2015 related to receiving the approval for Bendeka from FDA.
For the year, total revenue increased 186% to $189.5 million consisting of $40.6 million in product sales, $99 million in royalty revenue and $49.8 million in license and other fees.
On the expense front, R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $16.7 million compared to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $7.9 million increase is due primarily to the increase in spending on fulvestrant and other accelerated and nonrecurring expenses.
Keep in mind historically our average R&D expense, excluding the employee expenses, during the first three quarters of 2016 was approximately $5 million a quarter.
Approximately $12.3 million of this $16.7 million in spending during the fourth quarter was related to accelerated and one-time expenses to advance our programs with $4.4 million in other R&D expenses during the quarter. This puts us in line with our average quarterly R&D spend.
In the fourth quarter, we elected to accelerate R&D spending on fulvestrant, a molecule we believe has significant value recording $5.1 million in development spending. As a result, we now have much of the development costs out of the way.

Our fulvestrant spending in 2017 will largely be related to running the clinical study. Registration batches associated with the product will be reflected, however, in our Q1 numbers.
In Q4, we recorded $1.5 million of nonrecurring filing fee expenses related to Pemetrexed. We spent $3.1 million in the fourth quarter to accelerate a project with AMRI moving the lead product forward.
And lastly, we recorded a one-time $2.3 million raw material write-off from one of our development projects. For the year, R&D expense was $30.3 million compared with $27.9 million in 2015.
Looking ahead to 2017, we expect our yearly R&D spending to be essentially flat. The maturity of our R&D spend will shift from formulation development to clinical expense as we move the company to a more robust and clinically focused commercial organization. We may run as many as four clinical trials this year, as Scott mentioned.
The nature of R&D expense in 2017 will be substantially different from that – the $30 million was spent in 2016. We nevertheless plan to be in the range of $31 million to $35 million in 2017. This includes $3.5 million to $4 million earmarked for our biologics division. If we opt to run additional clinical studies during the year, R&D spending may increase. That will become clear as the year progresses.
Back to our 2016 expenses; SG&A was $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $5.6 million in the prior year’s quarter. G&A remained essentially flat for the quarter.
Sales and marketing expenses and personnel-related expenses accounted for the bulk of the $11.8 million increase and grew largely in accordance with our pre-launch activities for Ryanodex for EHS. Here again we are able to utilize our growing cash position to accelerate $3.3 million in spending from Ryanodex for EHS marketing activities.
For the year, SG&A expenses increased to $52.3 million due to overall expansion of the business. For 2017, we expect SG&A to be in the range of $65 million to $68 million, a $13 million to $16 million increase.
In 2017, as we’ve mentioned before, we don’t expect to renew the Spectrum contract when it expires in July. The money we save will not be a complete offset but will be a substantial one against the cost of building our own sales force as we prepare for the launch of Ryanodex for EHS. We expect that even with launch expenses, our Ryanodex franchise will have a positive P&L effect in 2017.
As you saw in our fourth quarter results, sales of Ryanodex for malignant hyperthermia were $3.9 million. We think this market still has room to grow particularly as we expand our sales force from 12 to 50 people. We anticipating stocking for MH and EHS in 2017. Even with added expense for our internal sales force, we expect Ryanodex to have a positive P&L effect and we are setting ourselves up for a very good 2017.
I’d like to point out that included in operating expenses in 2016 is approximately $10 million related to stock-based compensation expense. That’s a 140% increase over the same period in 2015. We estimate that stock-based compensation expense will increase to approximately $15.5 million in 2017.
Next, let’s talk about our changing tax landscape which affected both fourth quarter and full year 2016. For the full year, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million. Included in this amount is a reversal of our valuation allowance which has been carried against the company’s net deferred asset consisting primarily of net operating losses.
Based on our current profitability expected in future profits, we believe it is likely that these tax numbers will be utilized. As I have previously said, the company expects to be a taxpayer going forward. As a U.S. company, we expect to record tax rates at statutory rates.

Earnings before taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $20.3 million. The net tax benefit for the quarter was $29 million which brings us to Q4 2016 net income of $57.3 million or $3.75 per basic and $3.52 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.08 per basic and $0.07 per diluted share in Q4 of 2015.
Earnings before taxes for the year was $53. 4 million and the net tax benefit for the year was $28 million. This brings us to net income of $81.5 million or $5.24 per basic and $4.96 per diluted share compared with net income of $2.6 million or $0.17 per basic and $0.16 per diluted share in 2015.
On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $75 million.
As Scott has said previously, I’ll add a little bit to this. We repurchased $19 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and a total of $37 million throughout the end of 2015. We’ve now repurchased approximately $48 million or over 722,000 shares of stock. We believe this reflects an effective use of our growing cash position and it is in the best interest of shareholders.
We ended 2016 with $52.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $42.2 million in receivables with approximately $31.1 million due from Teva. And don’t forget we have a $25 million milestone payment due from Teva related to the Bendeka sales milestone.
Thank you. With that, I’ll turn it over to David Pernock.
David Pernock
Thank you, David. I’m very pleased to be on the call and my role in Eagle as President and Chief Commercial Officer. As an Eagle Board member, I became deeply involved in the company’s pipeline and prospects which made a decision to take this position straightforward.
I am confident in Eagle’s future and glad to be onboard in this capacity to ensure a successful commercial launch for our next product Ryanodex. We are working diligently to prepare for our first self-launch product which if approved will be first in class and the only drug in the market for treatment of exertional heat stroke.
There is a high clinical need in the market. We believe that if approved by the FDA, our Ryanodex formulation for exertional heat stroke will feel that need. Ineffective treatment can lead to severe neurological complications and even death. As many as 30% of patients with exertional heat stroke experience long-term neurological damage. With Ryanodex once approved, we believe practitioners will be able to treat heat stroke patients from the inside out.
We know that the brain heats up faster than the body and is more likely to have sustaining damage from exertional heat stroke. Elevated temperature can lead to calcium dysregulation that lead to cell damage and cell death in the brain. We believe our formulation by modulating the ryanodine receptors in the brain which are intracellular calcium release channels may contribute to restoring calcium homeostasis, arresting the excitotoxicity cascade and ameliorating brain damage.
We know that external cooling methods alone are not sufficient to shutoff the receptors. Our goal is to help protect patients from a long-term impact of exertional heat stroke by including Ryanodex with the current standard of care. To accomplish this, we plan to increase our internal sales force to 50. We’ll be targeting the top 2,500 hospitals and the military. We also plan to work with large major influencers and stakeholders to change treatment guidelines and protocols.
Medical education will play a significant portion of what we do to inform the market. Cooling, while important is clearly not enough, more must be done. We will be launching a public relations campaign to raise awareness that a drug option is available to treat exertional heat stroke. Let me just remind you that we submitted the product to the FDA in January. We’re awaiting FDA approval and are hopeful for a decision in this July.

I am proud to highlight that Dr. Julian Bailes is a driving force who shed light on the issue of concussion in the NFL is now working with Eagle in an advisory role. His efforts formed the basis of the movie Concussion which described a devastating impact of brain injury suffered by football players. Many of those afflicted by EHS are young athletes in the prime of their lives.
And as I said a moment ago, those that survive EHS attacks often have brain damage. Dr. Bailes is passionate about the negative impact of EHS on the brain and we are fortunate that he will serve as a consultant at Eagle as we work to raise public awareness of this condition. This is an important product for Eagle with the potential to be a significant addition to our portfolio.
As David Riggs mentioned, with the Spectrum sales force deal ending here, we expect our direct sales expense as we build our team to be substantially offset by that savings. With additional expenses largely attributed to our direct marketing efforts. This is an important launch for Eagle demonstrating our ability to commercialize products without partnering and we also plan to allocate the necessary resources to ensure its success. We believe that building our own internal commercial team of approximately 50 builds strength in the marketplace and open new opportunities for the future.
To sum it up, there’s a clear unmet medical need with life threatening consequences. We believe we have the right product candidate to fit that need. We are building the organization for a successful launch in anticipation of approval. We believe Ryanodex has the potential to treat MH, EHS and other hyperthermic conditions including those induced by drugs such as Ecstasy and methamphetamines. But more importantly, our Ryanodex portfolio will be profitable this year. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Adrian who will discuss some additional pipeline opportunities.
Adrian Hepner
Thank you, David. As Scott and David mentioned, we are also exploring the potential for Ryanodex in treatment hyperthermia induced by Ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication, which may lead to neurological complications and brain injury. This will be a very important self-indication for Ryanodex as over 125,000 emergency room visits annually are related to Ecstasy and meth use just in the United States.
We are working jointly with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health in our effort to address this growing public health problem. NIDA began a pivotal animal study during the summer of 2016. Initial data shows that animals with Ecstasy-induced hyperthermia treated with Ryanodex had a greater decrease in brain temperature compared to animals treated with the control only.
We are very encouraged with the results and filed a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in December. In the meeting, the FDA suggested expanding the indication to evaluating severe organ dysfunction and damage such as renal and liver impairment in patients with MDMA and methamphetamine intoxication which we plan to do. It’s important to keep in mind that while the ryanodine receptors play a major role in the brain, these receptors are also widely found throughout the human body.
We do not believe a full clinical trial will be required to support the efficacy of Ryanodex for this indication. At this time, we are planning a pilot clinical study to maximize the strength and quality of our pivotal trial. We anticipate that a single robust control and well powered clinical trial may be sufficient for filing the NDA. A pilot study will start as soon as possible with a pivotal study anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year.

As Scott and David noted, we have also advanced our trial to develop an innovative formulation for fulvestrant for use by breast cancer patients. The currently marketed formulation requires two large intramuscular injections to deliver the monthly recommended dose. It contains castor oil and a warning has been added to the label concerning painful injections, sciatica, neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy. The injections can last 1 to 2 minutes each.
Our unique formulation contains no castor oil and only requires one monthly injection allowing for isolated injection sites every month. Therefore, our belief is that we can eliminate the current warning in the label by conducting the appropriate clinical trial. Our innovative formulation and simplified dose regimen may offer competitive improvements for the market to convert. And this product could be an important addition to the long-term value of our business. These are just two of the products we are balancing. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
With that, I will turn the call back to Scott.
Scott Tarriff
Thanks, Adrian. In my opening remarks, I indicate that 2016 was an important year for Eagle. Market share grew and Bendeka now holds a 92% share of the bendamustine market. We achieved major milestones and just met another, surpassing 500 million in cumulative Bendeka sales since launch.
We strengthened our IP with a total now of 14 issued or allowed patents. We accelerated development of fulvestrant. We submitted an NDA for Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke and initiated studies with the NIH for Ecstasy and meth intoxication.
We submitted an NDA for Pemetrexed which has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We entered into the most attractive drug market in the world with the formation of Eagle Biologics and we managed our money and maximized shareholder return by accelerating to expand in Q4 and repurchasing our stock.
As we look at the year ahead in 2017, we are poised to be even more significant than in '16. Bendeka will continue to be a solid contributor to our earnings with an additional $25 million in milestone payments from Teva reflecting in our performance this year.
We anticipate an FDA decision on two NDA submissions; Ryanodex for EHS which could be as early as July and Pemetrexed with a PDUFA date of October 30 of this year. We will be scaling our commercial organization to prepare for its first self-launched commercial product if approved.
We will pursue opportunities to apply the Eagle model to the growing field of biologics by improving delivery and partnering with an innovator or with those developing biosimilars. And importantly, we have additional pipeline opportunities that we will discuss as the year progress.
I am very proud of the work our team has accomplished in creating products that improve people’s lives and deliver value to our shareholders. I’m very more excited about the additional value in our pipeline that we plan to unlock in the coming months.
Thank you for your support and for joining us this morning. Operator, please go ahead and open the line for questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
David Amsellem
So a few questions here; first, on Ryanodex on the clinical program in drug-induced hyperthermia. Can you provide, and maybe it’s too early to do this but can you provide details on what the design of a controlled pivotal trial will look like? And then secondly on Pemetrexed, is it your expectation that you’re going to get sued by Lilly and maybe walk us through how you’re thinking about that from a legal perspective? And then lastly, I know we asked these questions a lot but this is on the big bag. I haven’t asked it in a while but any plans there regarding the big bag on bendamustine and is that something that may be in the cards down the road? Thanks.

Scott Tarriff
Hi, David. Thank you very much. Let me take your questions if you don’t mind in reverse order. Look, big bag; we’re thrilled with how it’s doing. 92% share of this market exceeds our expectations. We started out slow. We were hoping for 80%, then we moved the target up to 90% and now we’re at 92 and quite frankly we think it’s going to continue to grow. They’re doing everything that we asked for; great partners. The product is building well. The feedback that we’re getting from patients and physicians has been wonderful as well. And I don’t think there’s any need in the short term to do anything with the big bag. I think where it plays a potential role and we’ll just have to see how we feel about it is ultimately when generics come to the market, if we want to use the big bag to keep that 30% of the share that we can if we’re going to lose. But for heaven’s sakes, we have all the way until the end of '18 to worry about that. So short answer, nothing imminent about big bag. As it relates to Pemetrexed, you’ve been involved, we’ve all been involved in these things before. You heard we described it previously when you’re trying to get to the market, it’s interesting, isn’t it, how our marketplace has evolved over time. We just have a better product. It’s going to be a rollercoaster of a ride to figure out how we get the product to the market once it’s approved. We feel really strongly about moving through the review cycle with FDA over the next 10 months and expect to have a positive action at the end of October. We really can’t comment on litigation on what may happen other than there’s just going to be a lot of activity between now and the time that we ultimately bring the product to the market. Lastly, let me ask Adrian if he can comment on the Ryanodex clinical design size of the DIH program.
Adrian Hepner
Thank you, Scott. We are working with the FDA and with clinicians experts in this field to decide the best study. And as we said during the call, we are planning to run a pilot study first to really make our pivotal trial as strong as conclusive as possible. With that being said, the study will be utilized in the current standard of care which will be standardized across every single clinical site involved in the study. All patients will receive that, as they should of course. And the Ryanodex will be added in a randomized manner to the patients that belong to that treatment group. With that being said, there are multiple factors and multiple measurements and several data we can use to really assess all the damage and of course the brain disorders associated with that. It’s well known that drug-induced hyperthermia especially associated to [indiscernible] as these two that we are planning to study produce severe kidney damage, muscle damage, liver damage and devastating population disorders. Of course on top of these issues come a confusion and many other neurological disorders. So all these are going to be taken into account in a holistic manner to assess how a patient progresses from the moment he’s admitted into the study throughout the conclusion of the study.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Adrian. David, I should add one more point that I neglected in your big bag question. Also keep in mind that we believe that in 2017 over '16, Bendeka royalty will grow pretty significantly for us. It’s a pretty good growth driver. And when you think about it, we now going into the year with this 92% market share right from the beginning of the year and so another reason not to worry about big bag into '17.
David Amsellem
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll go next to the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Randall Stanicky
Great. Thanks. Scott, on Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke for investors who are looking at this and looking at the upcoming launch which is going to be new and unique unmet need, it’s obviously a new category. Can you just walk through the selling process of the 50 reps? Who are they going to be selling to? Are these PT committees? How should we think about the uptake here in order to set expectations appropriately and penetration and how quickly can that happen?

Scott Tarriff
Randall, I’m going to turn that over to Dave Pernock. Let me remind you just upfront. We have basically three categories. We have the military, we have the hospitals and we have the ambulances all playing a part in this. But I think this is best for David to go and respond to.
David Pernock
Thank you, Scott. Randall, to address your question, our primary focus is going to be on emergency rooms and the military for the most part during the first core parts of the launch. A couple of factors to keep in mind is that even military is potentially a very large purchaser of our product as well, because exertional heat stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term injury. In military outside of – what happens on battlefield. So we work the government exclusively. We’re in the process of hiring a really high talented team there. And we have a good plan going forward. In terms of the emergency room, we’re working with emergency medicine physicians. Often times, our sports medicine physicians are involved in helping influence guidelines with emergency room medicine physicians and also neurology sometimes has a key role too. Therefore, it’s important for us to bring Dr. Bailes onboard. Importantly, our reps will be calling on the top 2,500 hospitals focusing on top-down approach. And we think we have a compelling need where fortunately that we already are formulary in a considerable amount of hospitals with MH which we think helps ease the formulary process for us. We’re just adding another indication. It’s not so easy compared to getting a new product approved through formulary. As far as formulary process for those hospitals over the platform formulary process, the way I look at it from all the experience I’ve had in launching many, many products in the industry is that we have a very unique opportunity here. And that we have no product to displace, no company to fight against on the formulary battles, because there isn’t anything for exertional heat stroke. We’ll be the first and only product ever approved in the world for exertional heat stroke and there’s a high unmet medical need. There not only is there a huge emotional component being able to help these unfortunate patients that have a heat stroke that are otherwise healthy, we have a very unique selling proposition here and we have very, very strong clinical data. And I think that’s testament to the fact that we hope to get approval by the end of July. So we’ll be ready to go. We’ll be working on educational programs. We’ll have programs to help build awareness of the disease state with a long-term impact of the disease state prior launch. We’ll be having a lot of public relations efforts, so Dr. Bailes will be available to the media upon launch and the brand’s spokesperson. And we will be able to cover 2,500 hospitals I think very efficiently and very effectively with the sales force in place.
Randall Stanicky
Thank you, David. On the assumption that you’re approved in July, how do we think about contribution or ramp? Obviously, I would assume that a military sale that could come early given the July timeframe. But in terms of the ramp, in terms of sales to hospitals and other groups, is this going to be an educational process such that we should from an expectations perspective step back and say, well, there’s going to be a little bit of a selling process here and think about that as a 2018 ramp, or can you get out there quick and start penetrating earlier?
Scott Tarriff
Randall, that’s really a very good question. I’m going to turn that over to David again. But before let me just remind you that what we’ve said today. We almost had 4 million, right, 3.9 million of Ryanodex sales in Q1 and it’s growing nicely. And so we’re still growing the MH market very, very well. We’re going from the 12 reps to the 50 reps, so we just feel good about the ongoing growth of the product. We do believe it’s a very large product out over several years. As I’ve said before, that’s the disconnect that we see and that’s the primary motivation that we’ve had since August to buy back our stock. As it relates to the second half of this year and the first six months of launch, what we’ve committed to so far is remarking that we expect that the P&L for Ryanodex will be positive this year with this added expense that we have in the launch year. And if we do a really, really good job and we have a nice profitable franchise in '17 that should set us up for really – what we think is a really very positive '18, '19, '20, beyond with this product and then you’ll layer on the new indications beyond this. And so that’s the way we’re thinking about it. David, other comments.

David Pernock
I agree. They add on to what Scott said, Randall, keep in mind a couple of things. This is a transformational first of class product. We’re going to get a lot of attention very quickly from emergency room physicians in particular. And then there’s going to be a strong push on their half as advocates and as other companies have with our very talented sales organization to get the product out and get the products on formulary, which means that we’re likely to get a lot of stocking. Let’s not forget that the typical dose is going to be 2 milligrams per kilogram and if every hospital stocks six to eight vials, that’s a big number. So we think people want to get ready, they want to get ready for usage in '18 but we’ll benefit from a lot of stocking. We also think that the stocking of EHS will help to even accelerate the stocking for MH, because hospitals – once the product is viewed as an umbrella product for the treatment of all hyperthermia conditions, hospitals want to train their staffs on how to use one product for all hyperthermia conditions including MH and EHS together. So we think one indication helps strengthen the other. That’s sort of the strength and the beauty of having wide portfolio products too. And our sales organization is particularly [indiscernible] and skilled at hospital formulary processes. Most of the people we’re hiring are from hospital sales background for major companies and they know how to get to the formulary process. And again, this is an atypical situation because we’re not trying to knock another competitor off. So we’re not – company A is not fighting company B. It’s Eagle and Eagle alone. And the only treatment out there is use some water. So all we have to do is get hospitals to agree to use in conjunction with water. We have very good safety profile with Ryanodex too. So we think that this will be much easier than other additional pharmaceutical launches. So we’re very excited about it and we’re going to make it happen.
Randall Stanicky
Helpful color. Thanks guys.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Randall.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll go next to the line of Irina Koffler from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. This is Andrew Geller [ph] on for Irina. Thanks for taking my questions. So thinking about EHS reimbursement, if a patient is treated by an EMT in an ambulance if they’re brought to the hospital, is there an existing pay and pathway in either setting or will Eagle need to petition for a special payment?
Michael Moran
Very good question. As far as reimbursement, we’ve obviously studied this issue very thoroughly and we’re very happy with the results we find upon extensive research. First of all, our initial targets are largely going to be emergency rooms and physicians. And ambulances will be somewhat of a partner for those ambulance services that are affiliated with the hospital but was in vertical integration, and some of the very large ambulance companies. We would be very successful with this product getting established with the emergency room physicians first, military equally and then basically in the following year on totally ambulances. We just want to say that’s twofold. One is that for reimbursement point of view, when a product is administered in the emergency room or in any hospital setting we’re very confident we’ll have no issues with reimbursement and likewise in military. If the product is administered first in an ambulance and they’re not affiliated with the hospital, you’re going to need different coding for that. So we’ll be working on that in 2018 as we apply through the process. We’ll hopefully have those in place sometime before 2019 season. Once we have the appropriate reimbursement code setup, which takes some time to get, then that opens up the opportunity to go to ambulance services. We also believe that again since the treatment of heat stroke hasn’t changed since the Roman Empire that there’s need for a pharmacological intervention. And so we think that we will be able to hopefully positively influence key stakeholders to influence guidelines to suggest that the simple thing to do and a most awful thing to do on behalf of patients is to add ranitidine [ph] to the standard of care. So with guidelines in place, reimbursement codes in place, we think that operation in administration of Ryanodex will be much easier to do a little bit down the road. But at the meantime focus on hospitals and military. There’s plenty of money to be made there and plenty of lives to be saved.

Unidentified Analyst
All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
We’ll go next to the line of Tim Lugo from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim Lugo
Thanks for the questions and thanks for all the Ryanodex color, I guess one more. Will the military be buying ahead of the summer? It seems like their buying patterns would perceive the formal indication by the FDA. And maybe can you talk about the fourth study which may be initiated later? Is that – I might have missed this but is that a Ryanodex indication? And if so, is that an acute or more of a chronic condition? And also is that included in the R&D guidance?
David Pernock
I’ll take the first part. So basically just taking about the military, obviously we can’t promote to military until we have product approval. So we don’t expect any sales or any orders prior to getting our drug approved. And then largely – when we speak of the military, what I’d like to point out is there is – military has all the extended arms and tentacles in military. For example, National Guard, Coast Guard, all these types of opportunities that emerge. So we’ll be working at the appropriate times with the four forces in the military. We’ll be working with every aspect of military, agencies and groups to protect every possible person in services as far as the heat stroke. Just as an example, National Guard often times gets a call to – takes a flight for response and things of that nature and obviously that’s a very ripe opportunity for exertional heat stroke. So we’re working with the appropriate agencies at the right point in time to encourage them to stockpile or to across the [indiscernible] product for them. So if 1,000 National Guards have been called to Wyoming in the middle of summer flight for response, we’ll be able to supply Ryanodex whenever they need it. So all these are different aspects that we’ve clearly brought through and we’ll be implementing as best we can. But we’re bound by the same FDA regulations with talking to military as well as civilian population, so we’ll abide by all those guidelines.
Scott Tarriff
Tim, in the conversations that we’ve had, our objective here at Eagle is to make sure that every military personnel around the globe has access to Ryanodex if they need it, and that is our first and foremost goal of the discussions we’re having. Let’s see where it ultimately takes us. But clearly that’s what we’d like to see. We think this drug is so very important for our military and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that there is appropriate supply available throughout the world. And then I think the clinical question, Adrian if you don’t mind taking it.
Adrian Hepner
Sure, Scott. So regarding the fourth study, as we are growing our pipeline and expanding our clinical capabilities wall, we are planning also to explore other therapeutic areas especially those will high unmet need where first in class will also be required to really address some devastating disorders. And I look forward to providing more information in the near future.
Scott Tarriff
Tim, the guideline – the guidance question is I think in the range that David provided to us. We’re in pretty good shape with what we have planned internally. There are other opportunities that are coming along in Adrian’s area and in the formulation area. If we’re fortunate enough to make movement on some of these other thoughts we have, we may need to add to the range. But right now I think we were very careful in how we provided guidance this morning.
Tim Lugo
Okay, understood. And maybe just a quick Bendeka question. I think when the initial guidance came out, it seem like most on the street were just assuming the competitive products were hurting the franchise and the frontline. It sounds like January and February shipments have been strong and obviously pricing wasn’t taken last year. So overall, how should we expect the kind of volume basis for bendamustine let’s call it over the next three years?

Scott Tarriff
It’s a little bit hard to tell. We’ve analyzed and we’ve had some outside experts analyze it. We’ve listened to our partners. We think the bendamustine market generally speaking is down a little bit low-single digits. There’s a lot of reasons why bendamustine is still the product of choice in the category. So we don’t see major differences. We think that there is pricing powers totally outside of our control. But in our models, we actually have over a three-year period of time Bendeka flat to up not down when you take into account. But again it’s outside of our responsibility. But I’ll point out again that in our models, we see Bendeka as a growth driver certainly in '17 to take a short-term approach to it going into January with a 90 plus share and we’re seeing that we have the 25% royalty now instead of the 20%. Clearly, the opportunity for growth in '17 is pretty meaningful. And we’re just really pleased where we are this year.
Tim Lugo
Understood. Thanks for all the clarity.
Scott Tarriff
Thank you, Tim. Are there any other questions?
Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I would like to now turn the floor back over to Scott Tarriff for additional or closing remarks.
Scott Tarriff
With that, I would just like to say thank you. I know it’s been a busy day for everyone. Thank you for spending the time with us. Obviously, we’re enthusiastic about our business going forward. We are doing everything we can to improve shareholder value. It’s a very important focus and I’m sure we’ll be speaking quite a bit over the weeks going forward. And again, thank you.

Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. CEO Asked To Resign  











Tweet








9/27/2006 8:31:23 AM


SPRING VALLEY, N.Y., Sept. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Board of Directors of Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PRX - News) has named Patrick G. LePore the Company's president and chief executive officer and John D. Abernathy non-executive chairman, effective immediately. Mr. Abernathy has served on Par's Board since 2001 and is former Lead Director. Mr. LePore was elected to Par's Board in May 2006 and possesses nearly thirty years experience in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The Board also announced that, at its request, Mark Auerbach and Scott Tarriff have stepped down as executive chairman and as president and chief executive officer of Par.

Speaking on behalf of Par's Board of Directors, Mr. Abernathy said, "The Board has the highest confidence that Pat possesses the leadership qualities, strategic vision, discipline and industry experience necessary to meet the demands of a highly challenging healthcare environment. He is an excellent choice to successfully lead Par along its chosen strategic path.

"All of us at Par are grateful to Mark and Scott for the contributions they made toward building Par into one of the largest U.S. generic drug companies and establishing the foundation for its branded business. We wish both of them success in all their future endeavors," Mr. Abernathy added.

"I am honored to have been selected for this position by my fellow directors," said Mr. LePore. "I assume my new responsibilities with clear objectives in mind -- further developing and growing our young proprietary pharmaceutical initiative and effectively managing our generic business so it is best positioned for success. If we do this, our shareholders will be well served.

"To accomplish these objectives, Par's focus must always be on meeting the needs of the patients and physicians that rely on its medicines and on serving its highly-valued customers. Par's success will also depend on the efforts and performance of its talented workforce. If we maintain this focus and effectively execute a sound strategic plan, Par can achieve improved financial performance and build shareholder value."

Mr. LePore, 51, began his career with Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. where he held a variety of sales, marketing and brand management positions from 1978 to 1984. He later pioneered the growth and evolution of Boron LePore & Associates from its start as a private company into one of the first publicly-traded medical communications organizations. In 2002, Mr. LePore presided over the sale of the company to Cardinal Health, Inc.

Mr. LePore earned his bachelor's degree at Villanova University and his MBA at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He also serves on the boards of Esprit Pharmaceutical, Montclair State University and the Junior Achievement Foundation of New Jersey.

Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets generic drugs and innovative branded pharmaceuticals for specialty markets. In 2005, Par received approval for and introduced the appetite stimulant Megace® ES, its first branded pharmaceutical product. Par's Generic Products Division is committed to providing high-quality pharmaceuticals that are affordable and accessible to patients. Par manufactures, markets or licenses more than 110 generic drugs. For press release and other company information, visit www.parpharm.com .

Certain statements in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. To the extent any statements made in this news release contain information that is not historical, these statements are essentially forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of predicting FDA filings and approvals, acceptance and demand for new pharmaceutical products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, new product development and launch, reliance on key strategic alliances, uncertainty of patent litigation filed against us, availability of raw materials, the regulatory environment, fluctuations in operating results and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the Company's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K reports.
