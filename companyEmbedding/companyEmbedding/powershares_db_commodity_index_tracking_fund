DBC Fund Description
The PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund tracks an index of 14 commodities. It uses futures contracts to maintain exposure and selects them based on the shape of the futures curve to minimize contango.
  
DBC FactSet Analytics Insight
DBC thoughtfully addresses the two thorniest problems in commodities: weighting and roll costs. The most market-like approach, production weighting, allocates heavily to consumables like oil at the expense of storables like gold. DBC threads the needle by capping energy’s economic dominance at 60%, yet allowing for a diversified portfolio. DBC aims to turn short-term contracts into a long-term investment carefully, by picking the cheapest of the tenors available for each of its contracts. This mitigates roll costs, but in cases where DBC selects long-term contracts, it can sacrifice responsiveness to short-term price movements. Note that DBC’s approach tends to trail our vanilla benchmark with its steep expense ratio creating a high hurdle to break-even. DBC's awesome liquidity, however, helps it win Analyst Pick. Expect a K-1 at tax time.

Analyst Report







Analyst Report



This ETF is one of the largest and most popular options for investors looking to achieve broad-based commodity exposure. DBC has the potential to add valuable return enhancement and diversification benefits to traditional stock-and-bond portfolios, but investors should be aware that this ETF invests in futures contracts. That exposes DBC to the nuances of contango, and may complicate the tax picture somewhat. DBC is a fine option for broad commodity exposure, but investors might also want to take a look at "later generation" products such as USCI.

                3 Commodity Charts to Watch in 2017 (DBC, JJC)            


    By Casey Murphy | January 3, 2017 — 10:16 AM EST    






Share





















































Commodity traders generally start the year by analyzing key charts to get an overall sense of where prices could be headed in the months ahead. Generally, diversified exchange-traded products are a favorite, but other niche funds are also used to provide insight into specific commodities and for getting a true sense of what commodities are driving the trend. In the article below, we’ll take a look at the charts and see what is in store for 2017. 
PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund
One of the most popular products used by active traders for gauging the direction of the commodities market is the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC). This diversified ETF is comprised of 14 of the most heavily traded commodities. Based on the chart below, the recent break above the dotted trendline suggests that prices are likely to head higher over the next several months. Referring to this chart, traders will likely use the upward curves of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages as confirmation that the long-term trend is shifting upward. Traders will utilize this level ($15.22 and $14.72 respectively) as the foundation for a bullish strategy by using them as guides for placing buy and stop-loss orders. (For more, see: Charts Suggest Commodities Are Poised to Have a Strong 2017). 

Copper
The surge in copper prices toward the end of 2016 was thanks to the election results in November. Based on the chart of the iPath Bloomberg Subindex Total Return ETN (JJC), the bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages in November, known as a golden cross, undoubtedly sparked the interest in many commodity traders because this technical signal generally marks the beginning of a long-term uptrend. If the hopes of increased infrastructure spending turn into a reality in the coming months, then the recent pullback toward the support of the 50-day moving average ($28.22) could be an ideal entry point. (For more, see: Base Metals Are Starting To Shine)

Silver
While base metals have excelled in recent months, precious metals have felt the opposite effect.  Consistent resistance by the bears since mid-2016 has dominated the trend heading into 2017 and based on the chart of the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), it appears as though the level to watch will be the 50-day moving average.  Based on the chart shown below, it is clear to see the impact of the 50-day moving average and how the bears have been using it as a gauge for where to enter. Also, the bearish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving average back in December suggests that the long-term direction is downward and most bullish will likely remain on the sidelines until the price crosses above either $16.12 or $16.86 depending on their risk tolerance. (For more, see: The Downtrend in Precious Metals Is Poised to Continue).

The Bottom Line
While diversified commodity funds such as DBC suggest that prices could be headed higher for the first few months of 2017, it appears as though much of the strength is coming from segments such as base metals as shown by the chart of JJC. Active traders may want to analyze specific funds when it comes to determining allocation just in case there are clear signals of near-term resistance such as that shown on the chart of SLV. (For more, see: 3 Commodity ETFs That Point to Higher Prices).
At the time of writing, Casey Murphy did not own any of the products mentioned in this article.
