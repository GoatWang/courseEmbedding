CITY OF INDUSTRY, California, January 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCQB:SGMD) today announces the signing of a new contract to become the exclusive manufacturer of the SmelPro™ cannabis transport system, which enables nearly smell-proof and discrete shipping of cannabis. Additionally, the company has acquired an option to purchase the Company marketing the innovative product.








The SmelPro™ product is a significant improvement over currently available transport units used in the cannabis sector. SmelPro™ utilizes the proprietary polyamide sandwiched tri-liners developed for Sugarmade's CannaShroud product, combined with active carbon filtration to virtually eliminate all odors. The units are designed to be easy to carry, or to be worn as a backpack, and will initially be available in a choice of three colors, plus camouflage.
Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade commented, "We worked for months with our factory contacts to design advanced features into SmelPro™. All closures utilize very low airflow technology, but to further reduce odor we added a unique Velcro closure. We also designed SmelPro™ with quality and field survivability in mind by using ultra-high quality materials and reinforcements. Thus, we are confident users will get years of service out of SmelPro™. All of our units from our initial manufacturing run are already spoken for and interest is strong. We are so excited about this product, we also acquired rights not only manufacture, but also rights to acquire the entire company and all of its intellectual property."
Sugarmade recently announced two other new products in the cannabis packaging sector, CannaShroud™, which is a unique security-oriented odor control transport system and DabBox, a unique concentrate packaging product for processors and dispensaries. The Company has begun receiving orders for both products with shipments from manufacturing sites expected this week.
About Sugarmade, Inc. (OTC:SGMD)
Sugarmade, Inc. is a product and brand marketing company investing in products and brands with disruptive potential. Sugarmade's brands include CarryOutSupplies.com, Sugarmade Tree Free Paper, FreeHand ThumbTray and CannaShroud™, the world's first Cannabis specific shipping systems. During early 2017, the Company will be launching Sriracha Stix, a revolutionary culinary seasoning product under official license from Irwindale, California-based Huy Fong Foods, Inc., the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.

Investor Relations
 
Dear Investors,
 
Thank you for your interest in our company. We trade under the stock symbol “SGMD” on the over-the-counter market.
 
Sugarmade, Inc. is a City of Industry, California-based, publicly traded company engaged in the promotion of brands and product that hold disruptive potential to current markets.
 
CarryOutSupplies.com supplies custom and generic printed paper products to the quick service restaurant industry.  Our specialty is printed yogurt and ice cream paper cups for small sized operators in this space.  It’s a little known fact that we one of the largest providers within this market sector.
 
The Company is also in process of introducing Sriracha Seasoning Stixs under our licensing agreement with Irwindale, California-based Huy Fong Foods, Inc., the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.
 
Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are encapsulated Huy Fong Sriracha Sauce and other seasonings in the form of a “stick” which are inserted into meat, fish and poultry prior to cooking. Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are a hard solid at room temperature, but as heat is applied the sticks begin to liquefy allowing the meat fibers to act like a sponge absorbing all the delicious Sriracha flavors.
 
Sugarmade plans to announce several unique Sriracha blend formulations under our distribution agreement with Seasoning Stixs International with products available to Sriracha lovers worldwide by the end of this year.
 
Sugarmade, Inc. and CarryOutSupplies.com hold a product supply and licensing agreement to bring the FreeHand® ThumbTray™ to the western part of the United States. The patent pending FreeHand product uses a strategically placed hole in the bottom of the tray that when combined with the powerful leverage of the thumb makes balancing a FreeHand ThumbTray loaded with food AND beverage practically effortless.
 
The company trades under the symbol “SGMD” on the over-the-counter market and is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with which it files periodic financial and other reports.
 
If you plan on being in the Los Angeles area and would like to meet with us, please do not hesitate to call to set up an appointment. We would love to have you stop by the office or give us a call to discuss how we are addressing this market in order to create value for all of our investors, management team members, directors of the board, and other stakeholders.
 
Sincerely,
 
Jimmy Chan
CEO

Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) Pops on New Product Acquisition

By Jermaine Farmer -  January 26, 2017

Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) is a penny stock that has started to garner attention as the stock bounces up the chart. The stock’s recent upward thrust is tied to the company’s announcement of the signing of a new contract to become the exclusive manufacturer of the SmelPro cannabis transport system, which enables nearly smell-proof and discrete shipping of cannabis. Additionally, the company has acquired an option to purchase the Company marketing the innovative product.
The chart shows 22% tacked on to share pricing for the listing in the past week, but this action is running counter to the larger trend in the name. However, SGMD has a history of dramatic rallies. In addition, the name has benefitted from a jump in recent trading volume to the tune of nearly 370% over what the stock has registered over the longer term.
Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) trumpets itself as a product and brand marketing company investing in products and brands with disruptive potential.
Sugarmade’s brands include: 1) CarryOutSupplies.com, which supplies generic and customer printed items to the quick service restaurant industry, 2) CannaShroud and DabBox, which are unique cannabis packaging products and 3) Sugarmade Paper a tree free office and copy paper made from sugarcane waste.
The Company will soon be launching Sriracha Stix, a revolutionary culinary seasoning product under official license from Irwindale, California-based Huy Fong Foods, Inc., the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. The Company has also recently acquired international paper contracts from Bao Coc International Paper and Plastics Limited, located in Vietnam.
SGMD is currently in development of several other innovative product lines, which are planned for mid-2017 introduction.
According to company materials, “Sugarmade, Inc. is a product and brand marketing company investing in products and brands with disruptive potential. Sugarmade’s brands include CarryOutSupplies.com, Sugarmade Tree Free Paper, FreeHand ThumbTray and CannaShroud™, the world’s first Cannabis specific shipping systems. During early 2017, the Company will be launching Sriracha Stix, a revolutionary culinary seasoning product under official license from Irwindale, California-based Huy Fong Foods, Inc., the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.”

As noted above, the stock is on the move in recent days, and the catalyst is clear: the move to takeover the deal space for SmellPro. This is a product that obviously has a market to the extent people want to move large amounts of pot around without the distinctive scent giving it away.
We can think of several reasons why this might be beneficial. In any case, this is another peripheral cannabis patch play. These have been doing quite well lately.
According to the company’s release, the SmelPro product is a significant improvement over currently available transport units used in the cannabis sector. SmelPro utilizes the proprietary polyamide sandwiched tri-liners developed for Sugarmade’s CannaShroud product, combined with active carbon filtration to virtually eliminate all odors. The units are designed to be easy to carry, or to be worn as a backpack, and will initially be available in a choice of three colors, plus camouflage.
Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade commented, “We worked for months with our factory contacts to design advanced features into SmelPro. All closures utilize very low airflow technology, but to further reduce odor we added a unique Velcro closure. We also designed SmelPro with quality and field survivability in mind by using ultra-high quality materials and reinforcements. Thus, we are confident users will get years of service out of SmelPro. All of our units from our initial manufacturing run are already spoken for and interest is strong. We are so excited about this product, we also acquired rights not only manufacture, but also rights to acquire the entire company and all of its intellectual property.”
Now commanding a market cap of $12.4M, SGMD has virtually no cash on the books, which is balanced by about $1.2M in total current liabilities. SGMD is pulling in trailing 12-month revenues of $4.1M. However, the company is seeing declines on the top line on a quarterly y/y basis, with revenues falling at -19.6%. You can bet we will update this one again as new information comes into view.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Cannabis
Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) Is A Cannabis Runner

Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) is up a little over 30% this week, on the company’s announcement that it has acquired the manufacturing rights for a cannabis transportation product. This is one that we have covered on a couple of occasions in the past, and one that – as with the majority of companies in the cannabis space – ran up on the back of the early November ballots in the US. Just as with the majority of companies in the space, however, Sugarmade has since given back a large portion of its post-recreational-legalization run, and currently trades at around $0.07 a share.

While the highs seemed a little overenthusiastic given the scope of this company’s operational activity right now, current prices look as though they may represent something of a discount to inherent value, especially with the latest announcement taken into consideration. As such, there may be some value in a near-term exposure.
Here is why.
By way of a brief introduction, Sugarmade is a packaging company that – across the last few months – has sort of pivoted towards the cannabis space. Its goal, and the niche in which it is trying to establish itself, is designing and commercializing safe, secure and odorless packaging solutions for the recreational and medical side of the cannabis space. For us, this is a decent market opportunity. Cannabis is going to have to be transported, and not only that, but transported safely and securely. A key part of this is ensuring handlers are unable to smell the contents, and it is this specific element of the packaging that Sugarmade is focusing on right now. Last time we looked at the company, we highlighted its CannaShroud product, which is a sort of plastic, envelope-style packaging designed to stop the smell of cannabis from escaping when transported, mailed etc.
The just announced manufacturing rights acquisition involves a similar product (at least in concept) but with the concept expanded to a backpack. It’s called SmelPro, and according to the marketing material, the bag utilizes the proprietary polyamide sandwiched tri-liners developed for Sugarmade’s CannaShroud product, combined with active carbon filtration to virtually eliminate all odors. The units are designed to be easy to carry, or to be worn as a backpack, and will initially be available in a choice of three colors, plus camouflage.
Right now, there is not much information available on the product, apart from that which the press release detailed. A quick Google search reveals a couple of non-reported bits of info, including a competition run at this site (48HoursLogo.com) that seemingly seeks to find a logo for the new product (see image below for the winner) and – as per the business brief listed on this site – the finished product will be a 50 gallon bag. In the brief, the listing states that the bag is for sporting, hunting, dirty laundry, storage, etc., but we suspect this is just an attempt to hide accurate use-case by the company for competition purposes.
Secondary to the manufacturing rights acquisition, Sugarmade has also picked up an option to acquire the entire company that develops the product if and when it chooses to do so. This suggests to us that SmelPro is going to be a core feature of the company’s retail operations going forward.
Bottom line, this one is a pretty tough one to figure out. When all is said and done, it is a retail entity with a focus on odor proof packaging, and there is nothing particularly inspirational or enthusing about that. However, with the recreational marijuana industry set to expand dramatically over the next five years, there is no denying that products such as those that Sugarmade is bringing to market right now will be in demand. As such, with quarterly revenues of circa $1.2 million (last two reported quarters) and a market capitalization of just $13 million, there looks to be some run room for the stock this year.
Cash is not great, and if the company is to continue acquiring assets at its current rate, it’s going to be diluting shareholders, but so long as these assets can induce value-add, this dilution should be offset.
