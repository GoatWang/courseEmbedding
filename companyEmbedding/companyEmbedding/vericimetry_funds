History
Founded in 1955 by John C. van Eck, Van Eck Associates Corporation was among the first U.S. investment managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its tradition of responding to the needs of investors by offering innovative investment strategies in emerging markets equity and fixed income, natural resources and commodities, gold and precious metals, liquid alternatives, and other specialized, global asset classes.
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006 when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today we offer more than 50 ETFs that span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of our ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region or sector. VanEck is one of the largest ETP providers in the U.S. and worldwide.

Historical performance is no guarantee of future results. Share price, yield and return on an actual investment will fluctuate, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your share.
ETF Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at the NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called "creation units" and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing.

FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

Vericimetry Funds Selects UMB Fund Services | Business Wire
























































Vericimetry Funds Selects UMB Fund Services






April 17, 2012 09:54 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UMB 
      Fund Services, Inc. (UMBFS) announced that it has been selected to 
      provide services to Vericimetry Funds’ initial mutual fund, the 
      Vericimetry U.S. Small Cap Value Fund.
    


      UMBFS will provide accounting, administration, transfer agency, 
      statutory distribution and fulfillment services for the fund. In 
      addition, custody services will be provided by UMBFS’ affiliate, UMB 
      Bank, n.a.
    

      “As we conducted our search for a service provider, the compelling 
      factor that drew us to UMB was their experience helping emerging 
      managers with their fund launches,” said Carlos Elizondo, chief 
      operating officer for Vericimetry Advisors, the SEC-registered 
      investment adviser to the Vericimetry Funds. “Not only was UMB able to 
      guide us through the process, but we connected well with their people. 
      We especially appreciated having direct access to their service-line 
      leaders and senior executives.”
    

      Headquartered in Los Angeles, Vericimetry Advisors was founded in 2011 
      by a core group of seasoned investment management professionals. Its 
      chief executive officer, Dr. Glenn Freed, is an academic with 
      demonstrated experience in the financial services industry. As a former 
      executive with Dimensional Fund Advisors, he delivered customized 
      quantitative investment solutions to both the financial advisory and the 
      institutional markets for much of the prior decade.
    

      “In forming Vericimetry, we sought to forge new ground into 
      quantitatively structured investment strategies,” said Dr. Freed. “We 
      assembled a team with extensive money management experience and rooted 
      in academia, whose collective educational and collaborative approach 
      serves an exclusive group of elite financial advisors. Our first 
      strategy seeks to deliver the small cap and value equity risk premiums. 
      As we continue to introduce new strategies, UMB Fund Services is 
      well-equipped to be a partner we can grow with into the future.”
    

      “We’re pleased that Vericimetry has chosen UMBFS as its service 
      provider,” said John 
      Zader, chief executive officer of UMBFS. “Our capabilities and 
      expertise will be an excellent fit with their needs, and we look forward 
      to partnering with them as they seek to build assets and grow their 
      business.”
    

About UMB Fund Services


      UMB Fund Services, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis., offers a complete 
      line of products and services to the fund industry, including

      n.a.; alternative investment services through JD Clark & Co.; and 
      managed account services. It currently serves approximately 200 clients 
      with combined assets of more than $200 billion. For the past two years, 
      the company has been named one of the top 10 midsize employers in 
      southeastern Wisconsin by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. UMB 
      Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: UMBF), the parent company of UMBFS, is a 
      financial services holding company with more than $13.5 billion in 
      banking assets, headquartered in Kansas City, Mo.

Client Overview



Vericimetry provides its investment strategies exclusively to select fee-only financial advisors whose investment approach integrates Vericimetry’s  strategies into their holistic wealth management solutions.  Vericimetry works closely with financial advisors in both the development and implementation of these strategies.
Financial Advisors
Vericimetry works with a select group of financial advisors who act as “institutional investors” by closely coordinating their investment decisions with Vericimetry’s investment decisions. Vericimetry believes an institutional investment framework improves the investment process by not straining to accommodate the needs of retail investors, thus keeping trading and operational costs low while providing our clients with targeted solutions and building deep relationships.
Individual Investors
Individual investors should expect independent investment advice from their financial advisors.  Vericimetry works with fee-only financial advisors that act as fiduciaries for their clients.  We strongly believe that having client-financial advisor “fee transparency” is critical to ensuring the fiduciary relationship.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

Huge community of friends, family and followers to start

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Keys to Success

More than 39,000 social media shares
Local and major national news media coverage of Safyre’s story
Several photos and two videos in the fundraiser gallery depicting Safyre’s positive attitude and courageousness

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.


Read MoreCollapse Description


Keys to Success

Nearly 7,000 social media shares
More than 40 photos and 15 videos in the fundraiser gallery showing Bonsai’s daily progress and interaction with other dogs
Local and major national news media coverage of Bonsai’s story
Fifteen fundraiser updates expressing gratitude for the support from donors and sharing news of Bonsai’s recent surgeries and status of his mobility device

Risk Premiums



Vericimetry believes in providing broad asset class exposure to the size and value risk premiums. In implementing such a strategy, we have our own unique approach to most effectively capture these risk premiums.
Size: It has been observed and well documented in the academic literature that over longer periods of time, stocks with small capitalization tend to outperform their larger peers.  Yet many portfolios are formed based on cap weighting, giving the highest weights to those stocks with the lowest size premium. Considerations of liquidity, turnover and capacity do make cap weighting a reasonable base case scenario.  At Vericimetry, we seek to enhance our small cap premium by:

Lowering our upper market capitalization size boundary when defining our small cap universe;
Extending our lower market capitalization size boundary deeper into the set of small cap stocks; and
Allowing deviation from cap weighting, with greater deviations for the smaller stocks.

We believe in a flexible and efficient implementation, not forcing any stocks into a strategy, but rather trading patiently as liquidity allows.
Value: The empirical case for investing in Value stocks is even stronger than that of Size. In particular, over longer time periods, stocks that are traded at a “discount” with respect to some financial factors have provided higher returns than growth stocks.  At Vericimetry, we use a multiple factor approach to define our Value stocks since it has been shown that no single factor (e.g., Book-to-Market) can consistently provide the highest risk permia among other risk factors. Vericimetry uses a composite score of various risk-premia factors (e.g., Book to market, Earnings to price, Sales to price or Cash flow to price) to define a Value stock.

Risks of Investment: please read about the principal risks of investing in the Fund which include common stock, market and small company risk.


As with any investment, Fund shareholders are subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The principal risks affecting shareholders’ investments in the Fund are set forth below.
Common Stock Risk: Stocks may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time. Price changes may occur in the market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular company, industry, country or sector of the market. Common stock is subordinate to preferred stock upon the liquidation or bankruptcy of the issuing company.
Concentration Risk: Because the Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in securities of companies in the financial services industry, developments affecting the financial services industry will have a disproportionate impact on the Fund.
Market Risk: The value of the Fund’s investments may decline due to market fluctuations caused by equity market dynamics, geo-political issues, adverse economic conditions or other broad market or security-specific risks.
Small & Microcap Company Risk: Small company securities tend to be less liquid and more difficult to sell than those issued by larger companies. Small company stocks can be more volatile and may underperform the market or become out of favor with investors. Microcap company securities may be very sensitive to changing economic conditions and market downturns because the issuers often have narrow markets, fewer product lines, and limited managerial and financial resources, resulting in volatile stock prices and a limited ability to sell them at a desirable time or price.
Value Investment Risk: Value securities may underperform the market or become out of favor with investors, and the Fund could lose money if the Adviser’s assessment of a company’s value is incorrect.
Management Risk: The investment strategies, practices and risk analysis used by the Adviser may not produce the desired results.


The Vericimetry Fund is distributed by UMB Distribution Services, LLC, 235 W Galena Street, Milwaukee, WI 53212.

Freed, Glenn. “To Roth or Not to Roth? That is Not the Question.” EliteAdvisorForum. Web. May 12, 2011.
 Read Full Article | Key Takeaways



Roth conversion planning requires a deep understanding of a client’s tax situation.
Clients must share their tax returns with you in order for you to conduct a thorough analysis. Now is a great time to ask clients for copies of their recently filed tax returns.
Converting a portion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is a form of “tax diversification.” The Roth conversion removes the uncertainty of the future income taxes associated with a pool of assets by paying income taxes at the current tax rates.
Roth conversion planning involves tax planning. An advisor can do tax planning, but the advisor should protect him or herself from being construed as the one giving tax advice. Only the client’s tax professional can give tax advice.



Freed, Glenn. “The Tax-Centric Advisor’s Investor Planning Framework.” EliteAdvisorForum. Web. March 9, 2011.
 Read Full Article | Key Takeaways



One of the keys to being an elite tax-centric advisor is creating an investor planning framework to enhance your clients’ wealth.
The elite advisor acts as the quarterback to make sure that all of the important planning issues are considered for each of their clients.
The investor planning framework can serve as a roadmap for servicing your clients.
Tax-centric advisors focus on planning with a view toward minimizing taxes and maximizing their clients’ wealth.



Freed, Glenn. “The Asset Location Decision.” EliteAdvisorForum. Web. January 13, 2011.
Read Full Article | Key Takeaways



Strategic asset location is a source of “tax alpha” for your clients.
Creating an asset location framework is key to delivering “tax alpha.”
Strategic asset location is both a “science” and an “art.” The art of working with clients on asset location is as important as the science of asset location.
Your client’s liquidity needs are important considerations in the asset location decision.



Freed, Glenn. “Getting Your Clients to Take What the Tax Terrain Gives You.” EliteAdvisorForum. Web. November 13, 2010.
Read Full Article | Key Takeaways



Clients expect their financial advisors to have a strategic investment plan to deal with an uncertain tax policy environment.
Behavioral taxation: Not all of your clients will act rationally when subjected to paying taxes.
Financial advisors need to lay out the tax terrain so that their clients can start making rational decisions.
Working with an expert tax team is critical to getting your clients to make the right decisions.

Implementation



Vericimetry’s broadly diversified asset class investment strategies allow us to efficiently trade in the equity markets.  Through quantitatively structured implementation and cost conscious trading techniques, Vericimetry’s investment implementation seeks to enhance returns for the investor by focusing on factors critical to investment performance: reasonable investment management fees, low portfolio turnover, low trading costs and maximum use of tax efficient investment techniques.
Reasonable Investment Management Fees | Vericimetry believes that public equity stock market prices reflect, on average, a fair price to make an investment. Public equity market prices reflect a highly competitive market among well-paid investment professionals. Vericimetry believes it is not necessary to spend time and money gathering and analyzing company level information to make the investment decisions. Instead, Vericimetry spends its time building strategies based on rigorous academic research and quantitative modeling to achieve broadly diversified investment portfolios. Vericimetry’s quantitative investment philosophy results in investors experiencing cost effective investment management fees that are substantially less than active management investment fees and that are quite reasonable for the level of risk exposure we seek to deliver.
Low Portfolio Turnover | A key component of Vericimetry’s quantitatively structured investment philosophy is low portfolio turnover. High portfolio turnover typically imposes high transaction costs that can reduce investment performance. By focusing on persistent risk characteristics, Vericimetry’s quantitative approach leads to a structured portfolio design with low turnover to deliver returns appropriate for a given asset class.
Low Trading Costs | Vericimetry’s quantitatively structured investment philosophy focuses on minimizing trading costs and their resulting negative impact on investment performance. Many active stock-selecting investment managers believe their selection skills outweigh their typically high trading costs. Passive index investment managers believe that their primary objective of adhering to an index is of more importance than the transaction costs of tracking that index. Vericimetry’s quantitatively structured investment philosophy includes trading flexibility that is designed to result in low trading costs.
Tax Efficient | Investor-level tax considerations are an important element of Vericimetry’s investment philosophy.  Vericimetry’s quantitative approach aims to incorporate tax-efficient techniques into its investment process to allow both tax-exempt and taxable investors to consider the importance of reducing the impact of taxes on their portfolio.  Active investment managers often consider investment performance only on a pre-tax basis, ignoring the impact of potentially significant adverse tax implications on overall investment returns.  Passive index investment managers focus on exactly replicating the benchmark, irrespective of tax consequences.  Vericimetry’s philosophy incorporates the goal of achieving low investor taxes into its investment process – seeking to enhance after-tax investment performance.

Methodology



Vericimetry’s distinctive investment methodology utilizes both academic thought and proprietary quantitative research to deliver targeted asset class returns to investors. These asset class strategies are designed to complement and enhance the current core equity investment strategies used by financial advisors who provide globally diversified asset allocation solutions. Vericimetry works closely with these financial advisors in both the development and implementation of our investment strategies.
The asset class strategies are designed for the institutional investor.  Vericimetry enables approved financial advisors to act as “institutional investors” by closely coordinating their investment decisions with Vericimetry strategies. An institutional investment framework allows Vericimetry’s quantitative investment philosophy to deliver superior market returns by not straining to accommodate the needs of retail investors.  This framework allows us to keep trading and operational costs low while providing our clients with targeted solutions and building deep relationships.

Fund Summary and Key Points
The VanEck CM Commodity Index Fund (the "Fund") seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (the “CMCI”). CMCI is a next-generation commodity index diversified across maturities, minimizing its exposure to the front end of the futures curvesBy spreading its exposure across multiple maturities and maintaining a constant maturity per commodity, CMCI seeks to mitigate the impacts of negative roll yield in contango environmentsDiversified across five commodity sectors and 27 commodity components; energy allocation typically around 35%In contrast with many “enhanced” commodity funds, offers “pure” commodity exposure by investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments and more conservative fixed income securities, such as U.S. Treasury Bills

Investment Approach

The VanEck CM Commodity Index Fund is a passively-managed mutual fund that seeks to track the CMCI by primarily investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments and conservatively-managed fixed income instruments. 


The Fund may invest in instruments linked to the value of a particular commodity or commodity futures contract, or a subset of commodities or commodity futures contracts, through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund formed in the Cayman Islands.

Important Disclosure 
Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics. 
†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distribution. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge. See the 
                 
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading
            expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 0.95% for Class A, 0.65% for Class I, and 0.70% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
            expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (CMCI) is a Total Return rules-based composite benchmark index diversified across 27 commodity components from within five sectors, specifically energy, precious metals, industrial metals, agricultural and livestock. The S&P® 500 Index consists of 500 widely held common stocks covering industrial, utility, financial and transportation sectors. The S&P® Goldman Sachs Commodity Total Return Index (SPGSCITR) is a composite index of commodity sector returns, representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures. The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond (BbgBarc US Agg Bond) Index is composed of the mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and government/credit bonds. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.

UBS and Bloomberg own or exclusively license, solely or jointly as agreed between them, all proprietary rights with respect to the Index. In no way do UBS or Bloomberg sponsor or endorse, nor are they otherwise involved in the issuance and offering of the Fund, nor do either of them make any representation or warranty, express or implied, to the holders of the Fund or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in the Fund or commodities generally or in futures particularly, or as to results to be obtained from the use of the Index or from the Fund.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.

You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. Commodities are assets that have tangible properties, such as oil, metals, and agriculture. Commodities and commodity-linked derivatives may be affected by overall market movements and other factors that affect the value of a particular industry or commodity, such as weather, disease, embargoes or political or regulatory developments. The value of a commodity-linked derivative is generally based on price movements of a commodity, a commodity futures contract, a commodity index or other economic variables based on the commodity markets. Derivatives use leverage, which may exaggerate a loss. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in commodity-linked derivatives, risks of investing in wholly owned subsidiary, risk of tracking error, risks of aggressive investment techniques, leverage risk, derivatives risks, counterparty risks, non-diversification risk, credit risk, concentration risk and market risk. The use of commodity-linked derivatives such as swaps, commodity-linked structured notes and futures entails substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value, lack of a secondary market, increased volatility, correlation risk, liquidity risk, interest-rate risk, market risk, credit risk, valuation risk and tax risk. Gains and losses from speculative positions in derivatives may be much greater than the derivative’s cost. At any time, the risk of loss of any individual security held by the Fund could be significantly higher than 50% of the security’s value. Investment in commodity markets may not be suitable for all investors. The Fund’s investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investment in traditional securities. For a description of these and other risk considerations, please refer to the Fund’s 
        
    prospectus, which should be read carefully before you invest. Again, the Fund offers investors exposure to the broad commodity markets, currently, by investing in commodity-linked swaps.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.
