Ownership
            of a thoroughbred racehorse can be one of the most wonderful and
            exciting   things
            that can ever happen to  a person. Follow along with us -- from
            the initial selection of the sire and dam, to the unfolding of the
            foal's potential as a racehorse, through the training, and then on
            to the ultimate enjoyment of having the racehorse join with you in
            the Winner's Circle.
Most people only watch and bet on a racehorse, but an
          owner has the ongoing satisfaction of not only seeing his horse win,
          but watching its offspring follow in its parents' hoof prints.
          We sincerely hope that you will take advantage of our web site links
          and read about our philosophy on this wonderful sport of thoroughbred
          racing.
If you would like to be part of us, we will provide you
          with all the necessary information. We look forward to your joining
          us in our efforts to become one of the premier racehorse farms in the
          United States.

              In our opinion, the two most important 
              racehorses in the racehorse industry have been Northern 
              Dancer and Mr. Prospector.  
              Northern Dancer was not only a champion racehorse, 
              winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, but is most 
              renowned for his tremendous impact on thoroughbreds of the modern 
              era.  At the Breeder's Cup Racing Series in 1999, the announcer 
              stated that 9 out of the 13 champions racing in the Breeder's Cup's 
              1-mile race were from the male lines of Northern Dancer.  
              What an amazing contribution this single horse has made to the thoroughbred 
              racehorse in modern times!  We have developed  
               Northern Dancer 
              into the broodmare side of our breeding program. 

The 
              next legend of the industry is Mr. Prospector, 
              whose son, Fusaichi Pegasus, won the Kentucky Derby 2000; 
              and when he enters stud for his first year, his stud service will 
              reportedly be over $100,000.  Again, Fusaichi Pegasus 
              is a son of Mr. Prospector, out of a Northern Dancer female line 
              (Danzig). 
Our 
              thoroughbreds' offspring are designed to possess these power 
              genetics.  We intend to mate not just any Mr. Prospector 
              sire with any Northern Dancer broodmare.  The sire and 
              dam we choose must possess our Five-Point 
              Real Conformation ranking, with 
              proven genetics as to their offspring probabilities. The result 
              of this will be to "fix" the Mr. Prospector and 
              Northern Dancer bloodlines.  We intend to improve upon 
              these bloodlines in the development of our own elite racehorse family.

What We Do

Our purpose is to produce horses that can race at the top level and reproduce themselves consistently.
Here are some advantages of our farm . . .
We start with the very best stock that others have attained.
We exceed what is considered the best in conformation.  We've established an advanced Five-Point Real Conformation system that tells us the following:


The horse possessing extreme speed at a specific distance on a specific track surface.


The horse having a burst of speed from a specific distance to the finish line.


Conformationally-speaking, the horse racing at a certain distance on a particular racing surface. 


 The horse having cosmetically attractive appearance.


 The horse having conformation that will not interfere with its racing career. 


Our Five-Point Real Conformation system was designed using a scientific method of statistical analysis, until a theoretic racehorse conformation model was developed; this theoretic model was then tested against both the greatest racehorses known and the racehorses that are known failures at the track.  The results of our finding are the farm's trade secrets.
Once our Five-Point Real Conformation system was established, the next step was to establish a system of genetic probabilities--specifically, what are the chances of a certain sire or a certain dam passing on their superior genetic racehorse abilities?  We now know what can be expected of a foal bred from a particular sire and dam, as well as the probabilities associated with these expectations.
An unexpected and surprising benefit 
              to the farm is that we can now select genetic "power sires" 
              without regard to stud fees.  Based on our Five-Point Real Conformation system, we have 
              found that many of the choice stallions are not necessarily the 
              highest priced stud horses.  For instance, Richly 
              Blended is one of our choices of 
              stud horses in the United States.  The few we ranked above 
              him had stud fees ranging from over $15,000 to over $100,000, and 
              many of those that we ranked below him had stud fees in the $30,000 
              to $40,000 range.  Yet Richly 
              Blended's 
              stud fee is only $4,000.  What an unexpected and surprising 
              benefit! 

We can now genetically "fix" our Five-Point Real Conformation system to a particular group or family of racehorses. In so doing, our horses will be able to compete at the highest level on an ongoing basis rather than just one-horse-in-a-lifetime competing at the highest level.
We are a vertically structured company.Since we don't need a number of horses and a number of breedings and a number of employees who can feed, maintain and race our horses to compete on the top level, we can accomplish the breeding, racing and training of our horses with only a few people.  Also, we can provide the company's other necessary services ourselves, without hiring outside help.  This cuts our costs, thus potentially increasing profits for the farm.
The company considers its shareholders as 
              owners -- we know that these owners are interested in seeing the 
              farm succeed and the Nevada 
              Classic Thoroughbreds race 
          at the highest levels of competition.

NEVADA CLASSIC THOROUGHBREDS, INC. 
 (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)

UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENT
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
company uses SOP 85-3, breeding horses under development. The horse
evaluation is adding in direct costs to the value of the horses
under development. The value is the lower of cost or established
market value, until breeding maturity, then the horses are
depreciated through the life of the breeding career. Pursuant to
discussions with staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in
January of 2006 and in keeping with SOP 85-3 regarding evaluations
of breeding stock, the following accounting practices have been
adopted and adjustments as of September 30, 2010.

Note 2:
PREFERRED STOCK

No special
rights or preferences have been assigned to the preferred
stock.

NOTE 3:
DEVELOPMENT STAGE OPERATIONS

The
Company is in the development stages of operations. According to
the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the Financial
Accounting Foundation, a development stage company is defined as a
company that devotes most of its activities to establishing a new
business activity. In addition, planned principle activities have
not yet commenced.

Note 4:
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF AN INACTIVE REGISTRANT

Under 17
CFR 210.3-11, the Company does not need to provide an audited or
reviewed quarterly report.

Reg.
17CFR210.3-11

Receipts from all sources for the fiscal year are not in excess of
$100,000;

(b) The
registrant has not purchased or sold any of its own stock, granted
options therefore, or levied assessments upon outstanding
stock;

(c)
Expenditures for all purposes for the fiscal year are not in excess
of $100,000;

(d) No
material change in the business has occurred during the fiscal
year, including any bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment or
succession or any material acquisition or disposition of plants,
mines, mining equipment, mine rights or leases; and

(e) No

~~PAGE
8~~

Note 5:
LONG TERM LIABILITIES - NOTES PAYABLE

In the
minutes of the Company, the Company's officers and directors would
pay the expenses of the Company up to June 30, 2010, or until the
Company can pay its operation costs as determined by the Company's
officers and directors. After June 30, 2010, the Company would
reimburse the officers and directors for any direct expenses paid
into the Company.

The
payback of the long-term liabilities will be within a five-year
period with a simple yearly interest rate of 5% on any outstanding
balance.

Note 6:
SALARY - BY COMMON STOCK

In the
corporate minutes the salary paid to the Chief Executive Officer is
donated to the company by the Chief Executive Officer until the
Company can pay its operation costs as determined by the Company's
officers and directors. 

ITEM 2:
PLAN OF OPERATION

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements, including the notes thereto,
appearing elsewhere in this report.

The
company in its developmental stage is now revising its analysis of
the prospective stallions for purchase.

The
company has elected to purchase racing colts and develop them into
breeding stallions, as its primary function. This function is the
heart of the thoroughbred industry, where the most expensive horses
are bought and sold, and thus, the most important sector of the
thoroughbred industry for profit to the company. If the analysis of
the prospective stallions is reasonably accurate, then the company
believes that it has the ability to purchase top breeding and
racing stallion prospects at a fraction of the cost of producing
and maintaining breeding stock to potentially accomplish the same
purpose. It appears obvious that, as long as the company enjoys its
PGMRN advantage, that of identifying potential top breeding and
racing stallions, it can purchase these stallion prospects at a
much lower price than it can produce them at this point in time.
Therefore, the company is going to specialize in selecting these
prospects until such time as it is more economical to produce such
stallions. Having the ability to purchase breeding and racing
stallion prospects at a substantially lower price than it would
cost to produce them, is a substantial benefit to the company and
eliminates the high risk of breeding and maintaining
broodmares.

The
company's future plan of operation is to dispose of its marketing
of its horse products division of Internet horse product marketing.
This disposal could come by advertising, outright sale, spin-off,
merger, or any other means the company has in its arsenal to
liquidate this asset to, instead, specialize in only the purchase
and sale of breeding and racing stallion prospects, as noted
above.

In
general, any other assets not specifically used for this purpose
will be eliminated. Furthermore, these assets have been used and
will more than likely

~~PAGE 9~~
be sold at a substantial loss to the company. None of the officers
or directors of the company will purchase such assets for their own
interests; rather, these assets will strictly be advertised and
sold to others outside the company at current market
prices.

RESULT OF
OPERATION

Power
Genetics Mathematical Racing Numbers(tm) (PGMRN)

The
minimum objective of the racing and breeding of stallion prospects
is to produce race horses that win graded-stakes races. The maximum
the company is hoping for is that the horses can compete and win in
the classic races.
