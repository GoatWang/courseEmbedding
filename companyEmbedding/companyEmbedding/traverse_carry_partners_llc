Project:
Repair Drywall



Chris did an excellent job on my garage attic project, which turned out to be very challenging.  He spent a lot of time getting to the root of why the issue occurred and set up a good plan to get it done.  He even killed a bat in my attic for me!  He will be returning to do some more jobs in the spring.

Project:
Repair Drywall



I have used Chris for drywall projects at my home for almost 20 years.  Chris has helped me with large and small jobs and has delivered the same great service no matter the size or cost of the project.His commitment to excellence with drywall finishing is obvious as he always asks for feedback.  He has even redone work for me when I was not completely satisfied.  The last job was repairing my garage ceiling and he matched the texture exactly!  I will not use any other drywall contractor, and highly recommend C&C Finishers.

Chris was great. First off if you are looking for a wham bam thank you maam, you have the wrong guy. Chris will take time and do the job correctly, if you are not happy with the way it turns out he will rip it all down and fix it. I would hire him in a heart beat. He will be a little more, but is willing to do it right. Thanks Chris!!

Quality of work is excellent.  I am so very pleased with the outcome.  Clean-up was completed in an orderly fashion.  Work was thorough.   I would recommend him for any ceiling/wall work needed.  He seems to be a master of his trade.

Chris is a professional and did a good job. However, his helpers did a fair job, they were not experienced in hanging sheets and roto zipping the plug and switch housing was not done very well. In fact I repaired 3 plug cut outs my self.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate.

            HomeAdvisor's Terms and Conditions for a full description of how we screen Service Professionals


**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals.

Brian Danlovich
CECA Supply has been selling Pettibone Equipment into the Sahara desert for nearly 10 years. With temperatures cresting 130 F in the summers, our clients needed equipment built to withstand those dry, hot & sandy conditions. The pipe yards in North Africa demand a lot from the equipment they use, and Pettibone has consistently risen to meet their needs.

American Energy–Midstream LLC (AE-MidCo), will change its name to Traverse Midstream Partners LLC and transition to a standalone company, the company said June 23.It is part of the American Energy Partners LP (AELP) group of companies, and was founded in June 2014. The changes will become effective July 1. The Energy & Minerals Group provided $500 million in equity to the company, and additional equity came from AELP chairman and CEO Aubrey. K. McClendon, other AELP management members and affiliated parties. McClendon is chairman of Traverse Midstream.Traverse Midstream has a 35% nonoperating interest in Rover Pipeline LLC, which is majority owned and operated by  Energy Transfer Partners LP. The 710-mile Rover Pipeline will serve shippers from the Marcellus and Utica to nationwide markets, and to the Union Gas Dawn Hub in Ontario, Canada, through its connection to Vector Pipeline. Rover has 15-year and 20-year fee-based contracts to carry more than 3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas. Transportation from the supply regions to the Midwest hub near Defiance, Ohio, is scheduled to begin by year-end 2016. Mid-2017 will see the remaining markets in service, AE-MidCo added.Traverse Midstream also has a 25% nonoperating interest in the Ohio River System, including a 52-mile, 36-inch gas gathering trunk line that will deliver 2.1Bcf/d of gas to Rockies Express Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission on the southern end, and an additional 1.4Bcf/d through a 12-mile, 30-inch lateral to the interstate grid on the line’s northern end, the company said. Ohio River  will serve Monroe, Belmont, Jefferson and Harrison counties in eastern Ohio, and is scheduled to be in service in third-quarter 2015. This project is also majority owned and operated by ETP, AE-MidCo added."I am very pleased today to see our second platform company announce its transition to becoming a fully independent standalone company. Along with Ascent Resources Corporation's announced separation two weeks ago, today's Traverse Midstream announcement serves as a reminder of the successful collaboration between EMG and AELP in starting, funding and developing first-class companies dedicated to a particular play, basin or strategy,” he said. “I've worked with Dave Shiels over the last five years and have 100% confidence in his executive abilities and I look forward to his leadership making Traverse Midstream one of the industry’s most successful midstream companies.”American Energy-Midstream LLC is based in Oklahoma City.

BARAGA, MI — Pettibone/Traverse Lift, LLC announces the addition of Leavitt Machinery to its dealer network for all material handling product lines. Leavitt will carry Pettibone equipment at its location in Washington State.
“We are excited to welcome Leavitt Machinery to the Pettibone family,” said Scot Jenkins, President of the Pettibone Heavy Equipment Group. “Leavitt has a tremendous reputation for providing premium equipment solutions to the material handling industry, making them a perfect match with Pettibone’s long-standing commitment to quality. We look forward to a long and productive partnership.”
Leavitt Machinery’s full-service branches provide cost-effective new and used equipment sales, emergency repairs and planned maintenance, long- and short-term equipment rentals, operator safety training and extensive parts support. The company’s primary emphasis with Pettibone will be promoting the Cary-Lift product line for pipe handling in oil and gas applications, as well as for tire handling in mines and quarries. The company will also carry Pettibone’s Extendo and Traverse telehandler lines for the construction market, and the Speed Swing loader for railway maintenance.
“We take pride in delivering a wide variety of material handling equipment options to our diverse array of customers,” said John Mutis, Senior Vice President of Sales for Leavitt Machinery. “Pettibone’s rugged and innovative machines are a great complement to our existing product lines. We expect to achieve great success with their equipment, particularly in demanding load handling applications.”
