How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Gregg F Orlen carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Gregg F Orlen currently holds license CS-002135 (Building Licenses, Construction Supervisor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Gregg F Orlen



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Gregg F Orlen



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
