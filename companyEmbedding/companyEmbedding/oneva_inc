What Customers Are Saying:




"The fact that it’s being brought about by a woman, and a minority woman at that is pretty cool.  ... There’s a need for it in the market. Whether you’re at the young end and need child care or at the other end looking at elder care or find yourself in that sandwich generation where you need both, the need is high."
- Fernando Hernandez, Microsoft Director of Supplier Diversity and Global Procurement, told TechCrunch this about Oneva




"Thanks. My wife and I are happy with the service from Georgia. She is caring and loving. We will consider service from Oneva, preferably  from Georgia or with similar personality & skill set. Thanks for help."
- Enterprise Employee




"Rashida was great, service was great! Love how you guys keep me updated when the caregiver is on the way. I will definitely be signing up for house cleanings on a regular basis, and would love to have Rashida back again. Thanks!"
- Enterprise Employee




"I liked the service [housecleaning]. Oneva made it very smooth experience. Looking forward for my future appointments."
- Enterprise Employee




"Penninah was great--she was warm, professional and detail-oriented. She took great care of Zach and straightened up the house after he went to sleep. It was such a treat to come home to a clean house. We'd love to work with her again."
- Oakland, CA

Business Information Technology Solutions Inc. Contract Award Announcement
Customer: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), VA Center for Innovation (VACI)
September 2015 – Falls Church, VA
Title: OneVA Pharmacy Implementation
PROJECT DETAILS: Business Information Technology Solutions, Inc. (BITS) has been awarded a sole-source prime contract in support of the VACI for the development of a software product which will modify the existing VistA software to allow pharmacies at OneVA locations to make changes and address prescriptions through a middleware model that meets VA standards. BITS previously completed a VACI project demonstrating this was possible and has been awarded this follow-on contract for a rapid development cycle to take it to the next level for proposed national deployment of prescription portability. Some modifications, such as the removal of controlled substances from the active refill list, will be made to the previously completed prototype. BITS will provide all the documentation, complete with all testing activities and training for the enhanced software product in accordance with Initial Operating Capability requirements for delivery of this capability. The BITS Team will provide a tailored set of Project Management Accountability System documents consistent with this approach.

What Customers Are Saying:




"The fact that it’s being brought about by a woman, and a minority woman at that is pretty cool.  ... There’s a need for it in the market. Whether you’re at the young end and need child care or at the other end looking at elder care or find yourself in that sandwich generation where you need both, the need is high."
- Fernando Hernandez, Microsoft Director of Supplier Diversity and Global Procurement, told TechCrunch this about Oneva




"Thanks. My wife and I are happy with the service from Georgia. She is caring and loving. We will consider service from Oneva, preferably  from Georgia or with similar personality & skill set. Thanks for help."
- Enterprise Employee




"Rashida was great, service was great! Love how you guys keep me updated when the caregiver is on the way. I will definitely be signing up for house cleanings on a regular basis, and would love to have Rashida back again. Thanks!"

"Penninah was great--she was warm, professional and detail-oriented. She took great care of Zach and straightened up the house after he went to sleep. It was such a treat to come home to a clean house. We'd love to work with her again."
