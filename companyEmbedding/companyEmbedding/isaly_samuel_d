The fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers- products, one might say, as opposed to services.   Sam Isaly’s Orbimed Advisors is a large health care fund investing in companies at various stages from venture capital to the public markets. The fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers- products, one might say, as opposed to services.The nature of healthcare investments requires Orbimed Advisors to take on significant regulatory risks and make sure they are up to date on major announcements and other events which can have an enormous impact on an individual stock’s price. Of course, the fund also has to ensure that its analysts understand the regulatory environment as well as the science behind a company’s product line. Samuel Isaly himself has been covering healthcare for over 40 years, roughly half of which has come as an investment manager and half of which came as an analyst for companies such as Chase Manhattan , Merrill Lynch, and Legg Mason.Orbimed Advisors’ grand strategy is to run a portfolio that is more or less balanced between large healthcare companies and smaller-cap companies where the investment team believes that future growth is not being reflected in the current price. When we look at its most recent portfolio, we see a fairly small number of positions worth over $100 million and then a fairly broad range of healthcare stocks. In addition, while there were some large increases or decreases many of Orbimed’s top picks remained the same and we’d assume that most of them are still close to the top of the portfolio.

AIFM & Portfolio Manager








In July 2014, the Company adjusted its operational arrangements to ensure compliance with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, (‘AIFMD’). Frostrow Capital was appointed as the designated Alternative Investment Fund Manager for the Company. Under a portfolio management agreement with Frostrow Capital, OrbiMed was appointed to manage the Company’s portfolio of investments.  These arrangements were put in place to ensure that the relationship between the Company, OrbiMed and Frostrow Capital LLP is compliant with the requirements of AIFMD.
OrbiMed Capital LLC
OrbiMed is owned by six principals, including Samuel D. Isaly, who between them have many years experience of valuing companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare sectors.
The OrbiMed Public Equity Investment Team continues to expand. Led by founding partner, Samuel D. Isaly, now over 80 investment professionals cover all aspects of research, trading, finance, and compliance. This includes over 20 degree holders with MD and/or PhD credentials, healthcare industry veterans, and finance professionals with over 20 years of experience.
The firm has a global investment horizon and the OrbiMed footprint now spans three continents with offices in New York, San Francisco, Herzliya, Shanghai, and Mumbai.
Investment Strategy and Process
The Team works constantly to identify sources of alpha generation with a focus on fundamental research. In healthcare, there are many primary sources of alpha generation, especially in therapeutics. Clinical events such as the publication of new clinical trial data is a prominent example and historically has been the largest source of share price volatility. Regulatory events, such as new drug approvals by US, European or Japanese regulatory authorities are also stock moving events. Subsequent new product launches are carefully tracked and forecasted. Other sources include legal events and, of course, M&A activity.
The Team has a global focus with a universe of coverage that covers the entire spectrum of companies, from early stage companies with pre-clinical assets to full integrated biopharmaceutical companies. The universe of actively covered companies is approaching 1,000.
OrbiMed emphasises investments in companies with underappreciated products in the pipeline, high quality management teams and adequate financial resources. A disciplined portfolio construction process is utilised to ensure the portfolio is focused on high conviction positions. Finally, the portfolio is subject to rigorous risk management process to moderate portfolio volatility.

Isaly advertising art in the mid-1960s featured the Swiss Lad, a skyscraper cone and the tag line "Peak of Quality" as an allusion to the family operated company's Swiss heritage.


Isaly's was a chain of family-owned dairies and restaurants started in Mansfield (Richland County), Ohio with locations throughout the American Midwest from the early 20th century until the 1970s. It is known today for its iconic chipped chopped ham and for creating the famous Klondike Bar ice cream treat, popularized by the slogan "What would you do for a Klondike Bar?". The company was founded by William Isaly, grandson of Swiss immigrants who settled in Monroe County, Ohio in the 19th century. By the early 1960s, the company boasted retail outlets that stretched from Pennsylvania to Iowa.
Isaly's early success was attributed to its loose company structure, which allowed for easy expansion without corporate overhead. William Isaly's first dairy was established in Mansfield, Ohio where he acquired the Mansfield Pure Milk Company. Isaly expanded the core business from processing milk for sale to other grocers, to operating his own retail stores with milk, ice cream, bread and lunch counter service. Isaly also pioneered the idea of the modern convenience store by opening at least one outlet that also sold gasoline to motorists.
The first expansion of the business took the company to Marion, Ohio after acquiring the Marion Pure Milk Company in 1914. Operated by Charles Isaly, the Marion operation was quickly modernized, and business grew accordingly. From Marion, the company expanded to Youngstown, Ohio and by 1918 had a dairy and new headquarters on Mahoning Ave. The Youngstown area was the largest Isaly's market boasting at one time almost 130 stores.[1] In 1929 they expanded to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (on the Blvd. of the Allies). Expansion continued through the 1930s and 1940s with additional dairies built from Columbus, Ohio (at North High Street and Arcadia Avenue) west to Iowa and 310 stores. Pittsburgh residents so highly regarded Isaly's that the company was and still is mistakenly considered a Pittsburgh original.
In its advertising, the dairies used the mnemonic phrase "I Shall Always Love You Sweetheart" to help with the spelling of the Isaly’s name. In Marion, Ohio, Isaly's fielded an amateur basketball team that played against the Marion, Ohio-based Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians and the Buffalo Silents - a team composed of deaf/mute players.
In the 1930s, Isaly's began a commercial building program that employed high style art deco / Art Moderne designed production facilities and retail outlets, most of which were designed by architect Vincent (Shooey) Schoeneman. The Youngstown dairy facility represented the apex of this project, with the streamline building (with exterior by architect Charles F. Owsley) dominated by a five-story glass block tower.
In addition to the Klondike Bar, the dairies were also known for their unique Skyscraper Cones, created in Youngstown by plant supervisor Sam Jennings[2] which eschewed round ice cream scoops, instead using a patented design that resulted in a long, inverse cone shaped dip.
The company also had great success in selling chipped chopped ham, sliced (shaved) razor thin for sandwiches. The sandwich was featured on the PBS special Sandwiches That You Will Like. The company also marketed "immunized milk for infants, supplied by special isolated herds of cattle."
Shifting consumer demands, declining sales for home-delivered milk, as well as corporate consolidation led to the closing of Isaly facilities beginning in the 1960s. According to Brian Butko, author of Klondikes, Chipped Ham, & Skyscraper Cones: The Story of Isaly's, it was the loose company structure – in an era of growing corporate homogeneity - that left Isaly's unable to compete on the wholesale and retail levels, leading to the closure of its dairies beginning in the mid-1960s.
Several members of the Isaly family attempted to continue to operate food-service operations. In Pittsburgh, Isaly outlets were converted to the "Sweet William" brand. In Ohio, restaurants operated under the "Isaly Shoppe" name until the mid-1990s when the final outlet closed in Marion, Ohio.
Since 1984, the Isaly's name has enjoyed a comeback of sorts, but one not overseen by members of the Isaly family. Delicatessen Distributing Incorporated of Evans City, Pennsylvania purchased the Isaly trademark name and markets the original quality luncheon meats, cheeses and sauces under the Isaly name in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. The concern also distributes Isaly brand ice cream (except Klondikes) to stores in Western Pennsylvania. The Klondike Bar product line is now owned by Unilever.
There are at least three Isaly's still in operation in southwestern Pennsylvania in the areas of West View, Turtle Creek, and East Allegheny (city neighborhood of Pittsburgh), all retaining most of the classic interior. In June 2012, ownership of the West View Isaly's changed hands. The new owners have kept everything in the store intact but slightly changed the name to "I Shall Always Love You Sweetie", reflecting on Isaly's acronym. To punctuate this, periods have been added after each letter in the classic Isaly's storefront. A former Isaly's franchise in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, which operated under the name "Bricker's Restaurant" after its Isaly's contract ended and continued to serve much of the Isaly's menu, closed in 2012.[3]

Isaly's & Klondike by Brian Butko - Bibliography



















 













 
 
 

























Bibliography
Having the bibliography cut from my book to save space was perhaps the hardest sacrifice, so I'm especially glad to present it here. Following are most, though not all, of the articles, correspondence, documents, and interviews used for the book. The numerous closures and sales of Isaly's branches left only a faint trail of documentary evidence. Over a period of nine years, I was able to assemble a wide cross-section, but much of it is in archives or private collections, and therefore not in my possession. If you're publishing further research and you've used information from here, please credit this site or my book, Klondikes, Chipped Ham, & Skyscraper Cones: The Story of Isaly's by Brian Butko.

According to Isaly Family Reunion 1995: descendants of William Eugene Isaly and Louisa Katherine Luedy Isaly, prepared by Samuel D. Isaly, of the eight grandparents of William and Katherine Luedy Isaly, six were probably born in Canton Berne (the other two in nearby Alsace). Carl Marty, referred to in a caption, was married to Verena Isely, born Dec. 25, 1861, but she is descended from what is called the Wisconsin branch of the Iseli family (for more, see the Iseli worldwide family website). Her sisters were Rosina Isaly Rufer and Magdalena Isaly Ritschard, all of whom lived in Monroe, Wisc., as of a Jan. 1965 program celebrating Verena's 103rd birthday the month before. In 1962, they held a family reunion in Wisconsin for descendants of Christian and Verena Beunker Isely: "Of the 14 children of the early pioneers, four are living with William Isely, 82, the youngest. Mrs. Carl Marty Sr., Monroe, is the oldest [100]," as per, "Isely Farm Setting for Family Reunion Program Next Sunday," n.s. [assumed Wisconsin], July 12, 1962. Carl Marty was also a cheese industry pioneer, and according to "Cheese Industry Art," Milk Products Journal, Jan. 1962, after retirement, he painted 600 cheese making scenes in oils, some distributed by The Swiss Colony, Monroe, Wis.

Mohler's envlope indeed has the farm logo and his father listed as superintendent. An attempt to contact Mohler was unsuccessful.

Extensive research was done by Linda Isaly Coughlin and Ellen Stoll Isaly on Swiss genealogy, and their 1985 Report on the Swiss Family Iseli, detailing their trip to Walkringen, where Christian lived, was very helpful. They also believe Verena's last name should be Zwygart, and not Fream as reporrted on the 1983 family tree. Rev. and Mrs. Bricker also provided a baptismal record they unearthed on a visit to Switzerland.

(It's believed that Verena's name was mistakenly misspelled Verona in a translation of the original document.) William and Louisa had a fifth son, George, who died before the dairy companies were formed.
