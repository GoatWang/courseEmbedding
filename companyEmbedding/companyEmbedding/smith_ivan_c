The original GENUINE Smith brand of 
  wood restoration products:
Invented by Steve Smith and manufactured by Smith & Co.
Steve Smith in 1972 invented this modern technology that restores deteriorated wood.  The entire scientific foundation is shown at www.woodrestoration.com


Smith's Clear 
      Penetrating Epoxy Sealer™ Also known as CPES™


Restoration 
      Kits now available!


Smith's Fill-It 
      Epoxy Filler™


MultiWoodPrime™


In 1976, studying a seventy-year-old chemistry text, Steve Smith found some 
  lost-technology in the field of concrete sealers.  This led to the introduction 
  of Smith's Permanent Concrete Sealer.  In the next few years, he designed 
  a permanent-bonding technology for cement and stucco that was solvent-free, 
  odor-free and green-as-you-can-get.  Doing the job once eliminates all 
  the environmental pollution of coming back again and again to do the job over 
  again.
The first-ever approval by the Swedish government for such a product was given in 1992.
Those products are now brought together under the Permanetrix™ 
  brand of long-lasting bonding primers and sealers for mineral surfaces.



Smith's Permanent 
      Stucco Primer™ Does for stucco what CPES does for wood.


Smith's Damp Concrete 
      Primer™


Smith's Permanent 
      Concrete Sealer™


Smith's Paving 
      Brick Sealer™



Other Smith & Company products solve problems and offer new opportunities:
In 1974 Steve Smith developed the first epoxy adhesive to reliably bond oily hardwoods.  His original Tropical Hardwood Epoxy and a popular expanded family of epoxy products are used today by not only individual boat-builders, but furniture restorers, specialty wood millworks, manufacturers of archery bows, baseball bats, speaker cabinets and many other high-performance wood products.


Smith's 
      Tropical Hardwood Epoxy Glue™ (glues any wood)


Smith's Oak & Teak Epoxy 
      Glue™ (highest performance on oak and teak)


Smith's Layup 
      & Laminating  Epoxy (for fiberglass layup)


 


Wood Vitality™ gives Fresher-Treated 
      Wood™ - Give your wood deck some rot resistance! Wood Vitality 
      is a two step waterborne product that impregnates wood with zinc borate, 
      a very well-known, almost insoluble material that is safe for humans and 
      does not interfere with any later wood-treatment or staining or finishing 
      product. Rot fungi, mold and insects don't like it. Not at all. It is essentially 
      harmless to us humans and our pets.


Mold Resist™ 
      – a unique, non-hazardous waterborne product, solvent-free and odor-free, 
      that discourages mold and mildew growth on any porous surface.


Smith's High Build Epoxy Paint™ - A moisture diffusion barrier coating 
      used in the repair 
      and prevention of gelcoat blisters (osmotic blisters, fiberglass 
      pox, etc.) on fiberglass/polyester boats, as well as coating steel boat 
      hulls, exterior architectural steel, outdoor ponds and other applications.


Epifanes Gloss Varnish - Now in stock! Please call 1-800-234-0330 to place 
      your order today.


Smith & Co. now offers what we believe to be the best traditional marine spar varnish available, for use when cost, weather, and applicator qualifications do not allow use of our Five Year Clear™. We tested it, and other varnishes in our laboratory under high-intensity ultraviolet light. Epifanes varnish held its gloss the best and lasted the longest. Skeptical?


Industrial primers,      adhesives and self-priming glue

Item Description: Michael Joseph Ltd, London, 1967. Hardcover. Book Condition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. Jacket by Ivan Lapper (illustrator). 1st Edition. First edition, first impression. Some edge wear and chipping to top and bottom of jacket and spine, corners slightly rubbed. Not price clipped (25s), no inscriptions, internally clean tight and square, overall a vg++ copy for its age. 175pp. The final Horatio Hornblower story tells of Napoleon's plans to invade England. Set in 1805, 'Hornblower and The Crisis' finds Horatio Hornblower in possession of confidential dispatches from Bonaparte after a vicious hand to hand encounter with a French brig. The admiralty rewards Hornblower by sending him on a dangerous espionage mission that will light the powder trail leading to the battle of Trafalgar . The book was unfinished at the time of Forester's death, but the author left notes, included here, telling us how the tale would end. Also included are two further stories 'Hornblower and the Widow McCool' and 'The Last Encounter', that tell of Hornblower as a very young and very old man, respectively.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Shares of fertilizer, seeds and nutrients producer Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (SMG) tumbled 5% Tuesday, after the company missed earnings estimates for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts at Raymond James said there was a tough comparison in the base period for the U.S. business after an early start to spring in 2016. The 3% decline in sales was mostly due to a 7% decline in the U.S. consumer business, which rose 16% in the year-earlier period in warmer weather, they wrote in a note.

Surname meaning for "Smith"
English: occupational name for a worker in metal, from Middle
English smith (Old English smið, probably a
derivative of smitan ‘to strike, hammer’). Metal-working was
one of the earliest occupations for which specialist skills were
required, and its importance ensured that this term and its
equivalents were perhaps the most widespread of all occupational
surnames in Europe. Medieval smiths were important not only in making
horseshoes, plowshares, and other domestic articles, but above all for
their skill in forging swords, other weapons, and armor. This is the
most frequent of all American surnames; it has also absorbed, by
assimilation and translation, cognates and equivalents from many other
languages (for forms, see Hanks and Hodges 1988).
