caption “Treasury Constant Maturities,” for the
maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no
maturity is within three months before or after
 November 1, 2019, yields for the two published
maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury
Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be
interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line
basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release

removal from service and any related repayment or retirement of
Indebtedness had occurred as of the first day of such period, with

giving rise to the need to make the calculation described above or
any other Indebtedness incurred after the first day of the relevant
Four Quarter Period bears interest at a floating rate, then, for
purposes of calculating interest expense, the interest rate on such
Indebtedness will be computed on a pro forma basis by applying the
average daily rate which would have been in effect during the
entire Four Quarter Period. For purposes of the

Additional Notes are established by action taken pursuant to a
resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate
record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any
Assistant Secretary of QCP and delivered to the Trustee at or prior
to the delivery of the Officer’s Certificate or an indenture
supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the Additional
Notes.
 

The Initial Notes and any Additional
Notes may, at the Issuers’ option, be treated as a single
class for all purposes under this Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided that if the Additional Notes are not
fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax

if applicable.
 

Section 2.02
                            
Form and Dating
.  Provisions relating to the
Initial Notes are set forth in Appendix A , which is
hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this
Indenture.  The (i) Initial Notes and the Trustee’s
certificate of authentication and (ii) any Additional Notes
and the Trustee’s certificate of authentication shall each be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, which is
hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this
Indenture.  The Notes may have notations, legends or
endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to
which the Issuers or any Guarantor is subject, if any, or usage (
provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in
a form acceptable to the Issuers).  Each Note shall be dated
the date of its authentication.  The Notes shall be issuable
only in registered form without interest coupons and in
denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, provided that Notes may be issued in denominations
of less than $2,000 solely to accommodate book-entry positions that
have been created by participants of the Depository in
denominations of less than $2,000.
 

Section 2.03
                            
Execution and
Authentication . 
The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery upon
a written order of the Issuers signed by one Officer of the Issuers
(a) Initial Notes for original issue on the date hereof in an
aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000, and (b) subject to
the terms of this Indenture, Additional Notes in an aggregate
principal amount to be determined at the time of issuance and
specified therein.  Such order shall specify the amount of
separate Note certificates to be authenticated, the principal
amount of each of the Notes to be authenticated, the date on which
the original issue of Notes is to be authenticated, whether the
Notes are to be Initial Notes or Additional Notes, the registered
holder of each of the Notes and delivery instructions. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or
Appendix A , any issuance of Additional Notes after the
Issue Date shall be in a principal amount of at least $2,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 

One Officer shall sign the Notes for
the Issuers by manual or facsimile signature.
 

If an Officer whose signature is on
a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid
nevertheless.
 
40 





 

A Note shall not be valid until an
authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate
of authentication on the Note.  The signature shall be
conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this
Indenture.
 

The Trustee may appoint one or more
authenticating agents reasonably acceptable to the Issuers to
authenticate the Notes.  Any such appointment shall be
evidenced by an instrument signed by a Responsible Officer, a copy
of which shall be furnished to the Issuers.  Unless limited by
the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may
authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so.  Each
reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee
includes authentication by such agent.  An authenticating
agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent
for service of notices and demands.
 

Section 2.04
                            
Registrar and Paying
Agent .
 

(a)                                 
The Issuers shall maintain
(i) an office or agency where Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer or for exchange (the “
Registrar ”) and (ii) an office or agency where
Notes may be presented for payment (the “ Paying Agent
”).  The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes
and of their transfer and exchange.  The Issuers may have one
or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying
agents.  The term “ Registrar ” includes
any co-registrars.  The term “ Paying Agent
” includes the Paying Agent and any additional paying
agents.  The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee as
Registrar, Paying Agent and the Notes Custodian with respect to the
Global Notes.
 

(b)                                 
The Issuers may enter into an
appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not
a party to this Indenture.  The agreement shall implement the
provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent.  The
Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address
of any such agent.  If the Issuers fail to maintain a
Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall
be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to
Section 7.07.  The Issuers or any of their domestically
organized Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar.
 

(c)                                  
The Issuers may remove any Registrar
or Paying Agent upon written notice to such Registrar or Paying
Agent and to the Trustee; provided , however , that
no such removal shall become effective until (i) if
applicable, acceptance of an appointment by a successor Registrar
or Paying Agent, as the case may be, as evidenced by an appropriate
agreement entered into by the Issuers and such successor Registrar
or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee
or (ii) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall
serve as Registrar or Paying Agent until the appointment of a
successor in accordance with clause (i) above.  The
Registrar or Paying Agent may resign at any time upon written
notice to the Issuers and the Trustee; provided ,
however , that the Trustee may resign as Paying Agent or
Registrar only if the Trustee also resigns as Trustee in accordance
with Section 7.08.
 

Section 2.05
                            
Paying Agent to Hold Money in
Trust .  On or prior
to each due date of the principal of and interest on any Note, the
Issuers shall deposit with each Paying Agent (or if QCP or a
Subsidiary is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto) a sum sufficient
to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due.  The
Issuers shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to
agree in writing that a Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the
benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by a Paying Agent
for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes, and
shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Issuers in making
any such payment.  If QCP or a Subsidiary of the Issuers acts
as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying
Agent and hold it in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto.  The Issuers at any time may require a Paying Agent
to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any
funds disbursed by such Paying Agent.  Upon complying with
this Section 2.05, a Paying Agent shall have no further
liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
 
41 





 

Section 2.06
                            
Holder Lists
.  The Trustee shall preserve
in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent
list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. 
If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuers shall furnish, or
cause the Registrar to furnish, to the Trustee, in writing at least
five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date and at such
other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such
form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of
the names and addresses of Holders.
 

Section 2.07
                            
Transfer and Exchange
.  The Notes shall be issued in
registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender
of a Note for registration of transfer and in compliance with
Appendix A .  When a Note is presented to the Registrar
with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register
the transfer as requested if its requirements therefor are
met.  When Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request
to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes of other
denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested
if the same requirements are met.  To permit registration of
transfers and exchanges, the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee
shall authenticate Notes at the Registrar’s request. 
The Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all
taxes, assessments or other governmental charges in connection with
any transfer or exchange pursuant to this Section 2.07. 
The Issuers shall not be required to make, and the Registrar need
not register, transfers or exchanges of Notes selected for
redemption (except, in the case of Notes to be redeemed in part,
the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or transfers or exchanges
of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to
be redeemed or between a Record Date and the Interest Payment
Date.
 

Prior to the due presentation for
registration of transfer of any Note, the Issuers, the Guarantors,
the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may deem and treat
the Person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute owner
of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of
and interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note is overdue, and none of the
Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 

Any holder of a beneficial interest
in a Global Note shall, by acceptance of such beneficial interest,
agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Note
may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by
(a) the Holder of such Global Note (or its agent) or
(b) any holder of a beneficial interest in such Global Note,
and that ownership of a beneficial interest in such Global Note
shall be required to be reflected in a book entry.
 

All Notes issued upon any transfer
or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture shall evidence
the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such transfer or
exchange.
 

The Trustee shall have no obligation
or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any
restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under
applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any
Note (including any transfers between or among Depository
participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note)
other than to require delivery of such certificates and other
documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do
so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture,
and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to
form with the express requirements hereof.
 

None of the Trustee, Registrar or
Paying Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or
not taken by the Depository.

Section 2.08
                            
Replacement Notes
.  If a mutilated Note is
surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Note claims that
the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Issuers
shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note
if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial
Code are met, such that the Holder (a) satisfies the Issuers
and the Trustee within a reasonable time after such Holder has
notice of such loss, destruction or wrongful taking and the
Registrar does not register a transfer prior to receiving such
notification, (b) makes such request to the Issuers and the
Trustee prior to the Note being acquired by a protected purchaser
as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code (a
“ protected purchaser ”) and (c) satisfies
any other reasonable requirements of the Issuers and the
Trustee.  If required by the Trustee or the Issuers, such
Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond or security sufficient in
the judgment of the Trustee, with respect to the Trustee, and the
Issuers, with respect to the Issuers, to protect the Issuers, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar, as applicable, from
any loss or liability that any of them may suffer if a Note is
replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment. 
The Issuers and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their
expenses in replacing a Note (including without limitation,
attorneys’ fees and disbursements in replacing such
Note).  In the event any such mutilated, lost, destroyed or
wrongfully taken Note has become or is about to become due and
payable, the Issuers in their discretion may pay such Note instead
of issuing a new Note in replacement thereof.
 

Every replacement Note is an
additional obligation of the Issuers.
 

The provisions of this
Section 2.08 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully
taken Notes.
 

Section 2.09
                            
Outstanding Notes
.  Notes outstanding at any
time are all Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those
canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those
described in this Section as not outstanding. Subject to
Section 14.16, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because
the Issuers or an Affiliate of the Issuers holds the
Note.
 

If a Note is replaced pursuant to
Section 2.08 (other than a mutilated Note surrendered for
replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and
the Issuers receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced
Note is held by a protected purchaser.  A mutilated Note
ceases to be outstanding upon surrender of such Note and
replacement thereof pursuant to Section 2.08.
 

If a Paying Agent segregates and
holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption
date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and
interest payable on that date with respect to the Notes (or
portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be,
and no Paying Agent is prohibited from paying such money to the
Holders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then
on and after that date such Notes (or portions thereof) cease to be
outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
 

Section 2.10
                            
Cancellation
.  The Issuers at any time may
deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation.  The Registrar
and each Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes
surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or
payment.  The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Notes
surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or
cancellation and shall dispose of canceled Notes in accordance with
its customary procedures.  The Issuers may not issue new Notes
to replace Notes they have redeemed, paid or delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation.  The Trustee shall not authenticate
Notes in place of canceled Notes other than pursuant to the terms
of this Indenture.
 

Section 2.11
                            
Defaulted Interest
.  If the Issuers default in a
payment of interest on the Notes, the Issuers shall pay the
defaulted interest then borne by the Notes ( plus interest
on such defaulted
 
43 





 
interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful
manner.  The Issuers may pay the defaulted interest to the
Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. 
The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record
date and payment date, which specified record date shall not be
less than 10 days prior to the payment date for such defaulted
interest, and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each
affected Holder a notice that states the special record date, the
payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. The
Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
defaulted interest proposed to be paid on the Notes and the date of
the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuers shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate
amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest,
or make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit
prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled to such defaulted interest as provided in this
Section 2.11.
 

Section 2.12
                            
CUSIP Numbers, ISINs,
Etc .  The Issuers
in issuing the Notes may use CUSIP numbers, ISINs and
“Common Code” numbers (if then generally in use), and
the Trustee shall use any such CUSIP numbers, ISINs and
“Common Code” numbers in notices of redemption as a
convenience to Holders; provided , however , that any
such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers, either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of a redemption that reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes and
that any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or
omission of such numbers.  The Issuers shall advise the
Trustee of any change in any such CUSIP numbers, ISINs and
“Common Code” numbers.
 

Section 2.13
                            
Calculation of Principal Amount
of Notes .  The
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, at any date of
determination, shall be the principal amount of the Notes at such
date of determination.  With respect to any matter requiring
consent, waiver, approval or other action of the Holders of a
specified percentage of the principal amount of all the Notes, such
percentage shall be calculated, on the relevant date of
determination, by dividing (a) the principal amount, as of
such date of determination, of Notes, the Holders of which have so
consented, by (b) the aggregate principal amount, as of such
date of determination, of the Notes then outstanding, in each case,
as determined in accordance with the preceding sentence,
Section 2.09 and Section 14.16 of this Indenture. 
Any calculation of the Applicable Premium made pursuant to this
Indenture or the Notes shall be made by the Issuers and delivered
to the Trustee pursuant to an Officer’s
Certificate.

Section 3.02

than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time pursuant to
Section 5 or Section 6 of the Notes, the Trustee shall
select Notes for redemption as follows:
 

(x)                                 
in compliance with the requirements
of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are then listed (as notified to the Trustee in writing by the

than $2,000.
 

Section 3.03
                            
Notice of Redemption
.  At least 30 days but not
more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Issuers shall give
a notice of redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, or as
otherwise provided in accordance with the procedures of the
Depository, to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its
registered address as recorded in the register (with a copy to the
Trustee), except that redemption notices may be given more than 60
days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article Eight
hereof.  In connection with any redemption of Notes (including
with the Net Cash Proceeds of an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including any
related Equity Offering.  In addition, if such redemption or

any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur
and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers
in their sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed.  At the Issuers’ written
request, the Trustee shall forward the notice of redemption in the
Issuers’ name and at the Issuers’ expense to the

payment of the redemption price upon surrender to the Paying Agent
of the Notes redeemed;
 

(6)

herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given,
whether or not the Holder receives such notice.  In any case,
failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice to the
Holder of any Note designated for redemption in whole or in part
shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any other Note.
 

At the Issuers’ written
request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption to the
Holders in the name of the Issuers and at its expense; provided
that the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee, at least five

Section 4.03
                            
Conduct of Business
.  QCP will not, and will not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any
activity or business that is not a Permitted Business. So long as
QCP and its Restricted Subsidiaries are in compliance with
Section 4.10, QCP and its Restricted Subsidiaries may elect to
change the property manager at some or all of its properties
subject to the Master Lease to any other property manager selected
by QCP in its reasonable discretion. At any time prior to the
Spin-Off Completion Date, QCP, Parent and the Issuers will not
engage in any activities that are not related or incidental to the
Transactions and the completion thereof or otherwise as
contemplated in Article Thirteen.
 

Section 4.04
                            
Liens .
 

(a)                                 
QCP will not, and will not permit
any Issuer or other Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary to, directly
or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien
(except Permitted Liens) on any asset or property of QCP, such
Issuer, such Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary securing
Indebtedness.
 

(b)                                 
For purposes of determining
compliance with this Section 4.04 , (A) a Lien
securing an item of Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by
reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted
Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination
thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or
more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof)
described in the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the
Issuers may, in their sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or
later divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later
time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) in any manner that complies with this
Section 4.04 and will be entitled to only include the
amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured
by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of
permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the
definition of “Permitted Liens” and, in such event,
such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) will be treated as being Incurred or existing pursuant to
only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving
pro forma effect to such item (or portion thereof) when
calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness that may be
Incurred pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or portion
thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to any revolving
loan Indebtedness or commitment to Incur Indebtedness that is
designated to be Incurred on any Deemed Date pursuant to
Section 4.08(3), any Lien that does or that shall secure such
Indebtedness may also be designated by QCP or any Restricted
Subsidiary to be Incurred on such Deemed Date and, in such event,
any related subsequent actual Incurrence of such Lien shall be
deemed for all purposes under this Indenture to be Incurred on such
prior date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any
“Permitted Lien.”
 

(c)                                  
With respect to any Lien securing
Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also
be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.
The “ Increased Amount ” of any Indebtedness
shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in
connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms
or in the form of common stock of QCP, accretion of original issue
discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies.

Event of Default information contained in the Officer’s
Certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 4.05, the
Trustee shall have no duty to review, ascertain or confirm the
Issuers’ compliance with or the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant made in the Indenture.
 

Section 4.06
                            
Waiver of Stay, Extension or
Usury Laws .  The
Issuers and each Guarantor covenants (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead,

of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that
would prohibit or forgive such Issuer or such Guarantor from paying
all or any portion of the principal of and/or interest on the Notes
or the Notes Guarantee of any such Guarantor as contemplated
herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or
which may affect the covenants or the performance of this

hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law,
and covenants that it shall not hinder, delay or impede the

suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no
such law had been enacted.

applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached their obligations under the Change of Control
provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.
 

(b)

make an Offer to Purchase as a result of a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Offer to Purchase in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this
Indenture applicable to an Offer to Purchase made by the Issuers
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Offer to Purchase or if notice of redemption has been given

anything to the contrary contained herein, an Offer to Purchase may
be made in advance of a Change of Control, subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, the
consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Offer to
Purchase is made.

(c)                                  
If Holders of not less than 90% in

mitigate risks to which QCP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
are exposed in the conduct of their business or the management of
their liabilities and not for speculative purposes and (ii) do
not increase the Indebtedness of the obligor outstanding at any
time other than as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency

of fees, indemnities and compensation payable
thereunder;
 

(D)

(5)                                 
Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 4.08 ,
 

(i)                                     
the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that QCP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant
to this Section 4.08 shall not be deemed to be

guarantees, Liens or obligations
with respect to letters of credit supporting Indebtedness otherwise

in the event that an item of
Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories
of permitted Indebtedness described in items (A) through

pursuant to clauses 4.08(1), 4.08(2) and 4.08(3), the Issuers
shall, in their sole discretion, be entitled to classify all or a
portion of such item of Indebtedness (and may later reclassify such
item of Indebtedness). At the time of Incurrence, classification or
reclassification, the Issuers will be entitled to divide and
classify an item of Indebtedness in more than
 
53 





 
one of the categories of Indebtedness described
in clauses 4.08(1), 4.08(2) and 4.08(3) or items

or paragraph above (or any portion thereof) when calculating the
amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred, classified or
reclassified pursuant to any such clause or paragraph (or any
portion thereof) at such time. At any time that QCP or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries would be entitled to have Incurred any then
outstanding Indebtedness under clauses 4.08(1), 4.08(2) and
4.08(3), such Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to those clauses. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Indebtedness Incurred and outstanding under the
Credit Facility on or prior to the Spin-Off Completion Date shall
be deemed to have been Incurred under item (A) of clause
4.08(4) and may not be reclassified. Indebtedness permitted by
this Section 4.08 need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness, but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this Section 4.08 permitting such
Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal
amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once
and any obligations arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of
credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness shall not
be double counted; and
 

(iv)                              
in connection with (x) the
Incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of revolving loan
Indebtedness under this Section 4.08 or (y) any
commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness under this
Section 4.08 and the granting of any Lien to secure
such Indebtedness, the Issuers may designate such Incurrence or
issuance and the granting of any Lien therefor as having occurred
on the date of first Incurrence of such revolving loan Indebtedness
or commitment (such date, the “ Deemed Date ”),
and any related subsequent actual Incurrence or granting of such
Lien will be deemed for all purposes under this Indenture to have
been Incurred or granted on such Deemed Date, including, without
limitation, for purposes of calculating the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable), satisfying
any Debt Incurrence Test and calculating Specified EBITDA,
Consolidated EBITDA and any measure contained in the definitions
thereof (and all such calculations on and after the Deemed Date
until the termination of such commitment shall be made on a pro
forma basis giving effect to the deemed Incurrence or issuance,
the granting of any Lien therefor and related transactions in
connection therewith).
 

For purposes of determining
compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal
amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt;
provided , however , that if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S.
dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the amount of
any reasonable premium (including reasonable tender premiums),
defeasance costs and any reasonable fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of such new Indebtedness. The
principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the
date of such refinancing.
 

A change in GAAP that results in an
obligation existing at the time of such change, which is not at the
time of such change classified as Indebtedness, becoming
Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness.
