  DASH CAM: YOUR EYEWITNESS THAT NEVER BLINKS
  

  You’re a good driver; you don’t speed, run red lights, or talk on your cell phone. Amongst most driving related incidents, did you know hit and runs are very common and insurance companies specialize in denying these claims? Also, minor or major, get into an accident and expect the other party to lie to the police or even better – flee the scene. Since the insurance company won’t pay unless the offender is found and sued, you are at fault, nice right?  
  
  

  Well that was before, thanks to dashboard cameras or simply “dashcams”, you can now have the best eye witness money can buy – and that’s a non biased video of proof; beyond a doubt the best evidence possible to back up your word. 64% of vehicular accidents are word versus word alone, forget about the others that are witnessed by a 3rd party.  Great, now you have to rely on what someone “thought” they saw…

  

  Nearly three million motorists are now recording their journeys with in-car cameras, according to a new RAC study. In fact, 25% believe fitting a dash cam will improve their driving, while 69% of those who have had an accident, involving a dispute over who was responsible, think having one would have been useful. Now motorists are starting to see the value of dashboard cameras, an increasing number of insurers are accepting footage when reviewing claims and some companies are offering discounts to those policyholders that have a fully-functioning dash cam installed in their vehicle.

  

  DASHBOARD CAMERAS PROVIDE INVALUABLE FOOTAGE
  

  In-car cameras have captured hysterically blatant fraud attempts, inept parking jobs and police stops gone awry. But video needn’t go viral to deliver a measure of justice for drivers who record their miles on the road.
  

  While merely owning a dash cam may not lower your car insurance rates all by itself, the footage that the camera provides may turn out invaluable in certain situations, keeping accident claims or moving violations off your record
  

  EYEWITNESS EVERYTHING WITH VEHICLE CAMERAS
  

  If dash-cam footage helps police find a hit-and-run driver or an insurance adjuster properly assign fault, the savings can be big.

  

  A collision claim to fix damage from a parking-lot scuffle costs you not only your deductible but goes on your record; a single at-fault claim for less than $1,000 raises rates about 18 percent on average, according to data gathered for Insurance.com by Quadrant Information Services.

  

  Find the car that hit you and took off, and the accident goes on that driver’s record.

  
HAVE A RECORD OF YOUR ACCIDENT

  Drivers often have completely different memories and descriptions of an accident. With video proof that you weren’t the driver responsible for a car crash you can save yourself from being found at fault by a car insurance company -- and receiving the higher auto insurance rates that go with that finding.

  

  Your dash cam footage can also expedite your claim, as it may prevent you from having drawn-out discussions with insurance companies about who was at fault.

  
GET OUT OF A TICKET

  If you’re stopped for a traffic violation you didn’t commit, offer up your dash cam footage to the law enforcement officer before the ticket is written. If the officer won’t watch it, bring the footage to court to contest the ticket.

  

  VEHICLE DASH CAMS FIGHT INSURANCE FRAUD
  

  The FBI estimates that the cost of insurance fraud is more than $40 billion per year. When auto insurers unknowingly settle fraudulent claims, all motorists pay hundreds of dollars extra each year because companies divide the cost of claims among consumers.

  

  REVIEW YOUR TEENAGER’S DRIVING SKILLS
  

  Drivers under the age of 25 have some of the highest car insurance rates due to their lack of experience behind the wheel and tendency to crash and cause claims. Anything you can do to keep your young driver from getting in an accident or from getting a ticket -- either of which is bound to raise your already high rates into the stratosphere -- is well worth the effort.

  
Falcon Zero’s Mission

    Falcon Zero was established in 2012. We dedicate our time and vision towards one common goal – make driving safer and cheaper. Simple. And with the power of dashcams this goal will be quickly reached. 


  As the world’s leading dash camera suppliers with the highest number of car cameras sold world-wide, more and more people are beginning to see the big advantages of having a dash cam in their car. Not only does a dash cam give you a nice feeling of having some kind of safety, it has also proven to increase the safety awareness of people driving their car.

  

  Dash cameras are often compared to radar detectors in the fashion that your investment will most likely pay itself back within the first year. Drive safe. Drive protected.
