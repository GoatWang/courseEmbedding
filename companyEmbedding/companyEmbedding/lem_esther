I learned to stand my ground and fight for what I believed in.
“Why the $%?*! would we waste good money on that?”
Those words, spoken by the CFO of the company where I was employed, erased all of the good feelings we’d developed during a week-long team building session in the French countryside.
Let me back up.
As the Vice President of Marketing, running the only “invest/grow” category in the company, I was struggling to identify ideas that would accelerate growth. We needed a new brand launch, and I felt that Axe – a successful global male brand – would be the perfect candidate. After all, in focus groups, guys were stealing the product. They loved the ads. But quantitative testing showed modest results at best. During that off-site event, I proposed the launch opportunity repeatedly, but everyone knocked it down.
On the last day, we had a group session with all the senior executives in one location. I knew this was my final shot at making something big out of something small. While the idea of speaking up in the group session (knowing that none of the senior executives had expressed support) made my stomach turn, I felt the topic had to be debated. “Why not invest in growing the category and launch Axe?” I asked.
Crickets.
That led to the CFO’s question. “Why the $%?*! would we waste good money on that?”
Even more crickets.
Then, another executive spoke up, acknowledging this inappropriate behavior. He asked to hear my case, right then and there. It was a watershed moment for me; I learned to stand my ground and fight for what I believed in. And after a few rounds of discussion, my points had not only been heard, but also accepted.
Axe did launch that year, and it proved to be an overwhelming success. It blew away our goals and turned out to be a catalyst for company growth. A second launch followed and the category became a “darling” for the company. I felt victorious.
I’m often asked why I, a female, thought I could market Axe, the only male brand at the company. “Why not?” I reply. “Throughout my entire career, I’ve only ever worked for men marketing female brands.”

ESTHER LEM, UNILEVER
Managing a Historic Men's Product Launch


	By  

Jack Neff.
	

	
	
 Published on June 03, 2002. 







18 of 20 > GO TO Next 2002 Woman to Watch

After years of men in a male-dominated package goods industry managing brands sold mainly to women, an odd turnabout is taking place, and Esther Lem is at its core. As vice president for brand development for antiperspirants and deodorants for Unilever in North America, she finds herself presiding over one of the biggest men's personal-care launches in U.S. history.

Unilever in August begins the $90 million launch of its Axe men's deodorant and body spray brand in the U.S. The Axe introduction follows the $35 million launch in March of a male-positioned Degree gel antiperspirant aimed at boosting the gender-neutral brand's appeal among guys.

Target mindset
"I've had an absolutely wonderful last 18 months getting into the headset of an 18-year-old guy, and I've got to tell you, it's a lot of fun," says Ms. Lem, 45. "I didn't understand it when I was an 18-year-old female, but I certainly understand it now."

Born in Canada, Ms. Lem came to Unilever in 1998 from account management for WPP Group's  Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, Toronto, then brand management with the former Warner-Lambert Co. in Canada. Once at Unilever, she began overseeing a wide range of home- and personal-care brands in Canada.

Ms. Lem in 2000 came to the U.S., where she and other Unilever marketing executives have been focused squarely on the young male psyche as they prepare for the company's biggest personal-care launch of any kind since the 1997 debut of the Thermasilk hair care brand, which topped $100 million in sales in its first year. 

Golf handicap
The married mother of 5-year-old daughter, Ms. Lem says she has a 20 golf handicap she doesn't expect to get any better as she concentrates on increasingly time-consuming duties at Unilever.

She describes her career as having several smaller successes leading to progressively larger challenges. Axe is by far her biggest challenge yet as Unilever strives to overtake Procter & Gamble Co. in the U.S. "We're going for leadership in this category," she says.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
