You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

About


              At Ella Paradis, the team believes that enjoying your sex life is a “lovestyle.” To that end, the online shop offers more than 8,500 adult toys as well as lingerie, bedroom accessories and more, providing everything you need to spice things up. Here, the staff maintains an open mind about sexual pleasure, removing the stigma from shopping for sex toys. They also hand-select only the highest quality brands made with body-safe materials, and put your sexual health, wellbeing and happiness at the forefront of every product recommendation. At Ella Paradis, you can always expect easy access to the things you want, along with the promise of an anonymous purchasing environment. 

For some extra fun in the bedroom, try the We-Vibe 4 Plus, a couple’s vibrator that can be controlled through an app on your iPhone or Android. Or, slip into a satin bra and thong set from René Rofé and light up a scented massage candle, which creates a romantic atmosphere as it slowly melts into delicately scented massage oil. Also on offer are couple’s games like Drink or Dare adult dice as well as bondage accessories like handcuffs and blindfolds, ensuring you’ll end up with a much-improved “lovestyle.”

Terms and Conditions For All Promotional Vouchers Purchased Through Gilt City, Inc.
Terms & Conditions


The following terms and conditions apply to all promotional vouchers ("Vouchers") purchased through Gilt City, Inc. or its affiliated companies ("Gilt City"), except as otherwise specified on any particular Voucher and except as otherwise required by law.  In the event of a conflict between these terms and conditions and the actual Voucher, the Voucher itself will control.  All persons purchasing, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Voucher (each, a "Customer") agree to these terms and conditions.
All Vouchers are promotional in nature and are issued by the participating merchant or vendor ("Vendor") through Gilt City as a service provider. The Vendor is the holder and issuer of the Voucher and under no circumstances shall Gilt City be deemed the holder, issuer or seller of the Voucher. The law applicable to the Voucher shall be the law of the state where the Vendor interaction with the Customer occurs. As the holder and issuer of the Voucher, Vendor is solely responsible for the value and redemption of the Voucher and for any and all bodily injury, illness, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or relating to any Customer and the compliance with all laws, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws relating to the Vouchers. Each Customer hereby knowingly waives and releases Gilt City and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives, from any and all injuries, liabilities, damages, claims and rights of any nature whatsoever arising from any act or omission of the Vendor in connection with the Voucher, the provision of the services and products relating to the Voucher, and compliance by the Vendor with applicable law, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws. Gilt City's sole role is as a service provider for the Vendor, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant law relating to any Voucher is solely determined by and complied with by the Vendor.
The Vouchers are coupons that provide a discount price from the actual or retail cost from the Vendor.  That discount is available until the expiration date stated on the face of the Voucher.  After that time, the amount originally paid by the Customer to Gilt City (the "Purchase Value") will be valid for goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years in all states.  If the Customer is located in a state which requires the Vendor to honor the Purchase Value of the Voucher beyond five years, the applicable law of Customer's state governs.  For example, a Voucher purchased for a particular service of the Vendor at the discounted price of $50 (actual retail price of $100) with an expiration date on the discount of six months from a specified date, may be used for the particular service for six months from such specified date; thereafter, the Customer may use the $50 value of the Voucher to purchase other goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years, longer if required by applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Vouchers that are redeemable for specific ticketed events, once the event date passes the Voucher expires.  Customer's acceptance of any redemption of a Voucher constitutes an acceptance of the redemption and a waiver of any claims associated with the Voucher.  The Voucher may not be redeemed for products or services other than those specified on the Voucher or as otherwise specifically permitted by this paragraph and may not be used to pay account balances or for products or services purchased from the Vendor prior to the purchase of the Voucher.
Vouchers are transferable without notice to Gilt City or Vendor. No resale of Vouchers is permitted unless such resale is permitted pursuant to applicable law. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash (in whole or in part) and have no cash value except as required by applicable law. If cash redemption is required by applicable law, the Customer will only be entitled to cash redemption based on the amount paid by the Customer to Gilt City for the Voucher, not the actual or retail cost from the Vendor. Vouchers may not be combined with any other offer, coupon, promotion or discount or certificate and must be used in a single visit to Vendor except as required by applicable law. Limit one Voucher per person per visit or purchase. Neither Gilt City nor Vendor is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers. If you lose your Voucher, go to the "My Account" section of the Gilt City site and print your certificate. The Vendor will accept the first Voucher presented with the unique number printed on the Voucher. Treat your Voucher as you would cash. Vouchers are subject to any limitations stated on the Voucher or by the Vendor. The issuance of any credits for the Vouchers are at the sole discretion of the Vendor except as required by applicable law. All restaurant Vouchers are valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated on the Voucher. Vouchers may not be used for alcohol, prior balances, shipping or handling, tips or gratuities or other fees except as expressly provided on the Voucher or as allowed by the Vendor and as permitted by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated on the Voucher or disclosed in connection with the purchase of the Voucher by Customer, the Voucher price does not include sales, value added or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Vendor at the time you redeem the Voucher. Any attempted redemption of a Voucher in violation of these terms and conditions will render the Voucher void.
All purchases of Vouchers and other interactions with Gilt City are subject to our Privacy Policy.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
