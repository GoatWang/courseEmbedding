Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the portfolios' performance results would be less favorable. All results assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.  The performance is as of the date shown; it may not include the entire investment portfolio and is subject to change.
		





Initial Class shares have no sales charge.
		





The returns for the portfolio shown do not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with variable products, such as mortality and expense risk charges, separate account charges, and sales charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts. Such expenses would reduce the overall returns shown. Please refer to the variable product's annual report for performance that reflects the deduction of the fees and charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts.
		





 Withdrawals of earnings or other taxable amounts are subject to income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals reduce the death benefit.
		





Prior to January 1, 2008, the MFS® Variable Insurance Trust II portfolios were formerly known as the MFS®/Sun Life Series Trusts.
		





No representation is made, and no assurance can be given, that any investment's results will be comparable to the investment results of any other product with similar investment objectives and policies, including products with the same investment professional or manager. Differences in portfolio size, investments held, contract and portfolio expenses, and other factors can be expected to affect performance.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The portfolio may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the portfolio.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, currency, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.
