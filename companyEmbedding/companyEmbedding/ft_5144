                    A Chick-fil-A restaurant proposed for Okeechobee Road would be the largest on the Treasure Coast, according to building plans submitted to the city. According to TCPalm Planning Director Rebecca Grohall said "Chick-fil-A is experiencing an 'If you build it, the people will come.' People look for a Chick-fil-A sign, and if they stop, maybe they would want to see what else Fort Pierce has to offer," 

Chick-fil-A also is considering opening a restaurant in St. Lucie West, on the north side of St. Lucie West Boulevard between California Boulevard and Country Club Drive, Port St. Lucie officials have said.

Stealth® Mi6™ rubber is for flat pedal riders who want the benefits of riding flats without giving up the performance of clips. Impacts were designed for DH champs and flat pedal specialists Sam Hill and Brook MacDonald. The new fast drying upper on the Impact has been slimmed down but provides more protection than the original Impact, shaving 25 percent off the weight.
