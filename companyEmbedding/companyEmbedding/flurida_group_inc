(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K.  Our Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.  Overview  Our business is the sale of appliance parts in Asia, Europe, Australia, North and South America. The main products that we sell to these markets are icemakers, motors, ice water dispensing system, and appliance assemblies and stoves and damper. Beside of those products, every year we consistently develop and research the new products, for example high efficiency-motor, crush motor and module. In 2013 we have passed the all customer's testing procedure and relative identifications. We intend to start mass production in 2014.  These parts are manufactured in China by Chuzhou Fuda Mechanical & Electronics Co., Ltd ("ChuZhou Fuda") and Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. ("Zhong Nan Fu Rui"). Chuzhou Fuda Mechanical & Electronics Co., Ltd., which is related and managed by shareholder and director Jianfeng Ding, is an appliance components and sub-assemblies manufacturer established on March 18, 2008. Chuzhou Fuda is located in Chuzhou City, Anhui Province, China. The plant space is around 100,000 sq. ft. with 18 molding machine up to 800 metric ton and 6 assemblies lines for appliance components and assemblies.  Zhong Nan Fu Rui was established in 2005 specializing in home appliance components and subassemblies manufacturing, and located in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. On September 18, 2007, amended June 25, 2008 and further amended on August 4, 2008, Flurida Group, Inc. signed a long-term distribution agreement with Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Zhong Nan Fu Rui is a Chinese manufacturing company which is related and managed by shareholder and director Jianfeng Ding. Although this Agreement expired in 2012, we continue to operate under the same terms as the written agreement.  We sell the following main types of appliance parts:  · Automatic Refrigerator Build-in Icemaker: The automatic refrigerator build-in icemaker is designed for household refrigeration products, such as refrigerator, under-counter refrigerator, freezer to make the ice cubes automatically  · Shade Pole Motor and Motor Assembly for Refrigerator or Freezers: The shade pole motor and motor assembly is a key part for refrigerators or freezers. Flurida Group Inc's motor part is designed and specified for the refrigerators or freezers made by Electrolux, an US company with headquarter in Charlotte, NC. Flurida also supplies the motors and motor assemblies to Electrolux Europe facilities in Italy and Hungary.  · Damper: A damper controls the rate of airflow from freezer into the refrigerator section. These dampers are being sold to users in China to build refrigerators.  We are an "emerging growth company" ("EGC") that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("the JOBS Act"), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) reporting and disclosure rules (See "Emerging Growth Companies" section above). We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Flurida Group purchased the parts from Wako Electronics, Inc., an US Company located at Louisville, KY 40299. Flurida Group also sold Rocker Switch, the key parts for icemakers, to ChuZhouFuDa.

Flurida Group, Inc. adds averaged 5% - 10% margin based on the cost of purchase, then sold to them, so, $ 2,412,372, and $ 1,100,387 were sold and invoiced to ChuZhouFuDa, and Qingdao Fubida Electronic respectively for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.  In summary, for the period of January 1 to December 31, 2013, the Company incurred the total gross sales of $ 25,374,242. And the Company had sales discount and return of $ 115,081, so, a total of $ 25,259,161 net sales were recorded.  In both fiscal year period ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 sales, more than 80% of total revenues were generated through Electrolux controlled subsidiaries in various countries. Electrolux Group operated its each subsidiary independently in each country, and all the sales orders and sales contracts were negotiated and signed independently. Accordingly, we believe that lack of one or a few subsidiaries of Electrolux sales order may have effect on our overall sales revenue, but the effects were slightly reduced in 2013 vs 2012. We signed long-term distribution agreement with various Electrolux subsidiaries, the risk of loss the contracts with Electrolux is significantly low.  Cost of Revenue  Our Costs of Goods Sold, as we expected will increased slightly due to increasing Chinese Yuan's currency exchange rate, labor costs, and raw materials. We anticipate this trend to continue and may adjust our unit price upward to reduce the impact of rising costs.  At the period ended December 31, 2012, the Company had ending inventory $ 2,278,467 that was majority purchased from ChuZhou FuDa.  From the period January 1 to December 31, 2013, Flurida Group, Inc. purchased Stoves from Zhong Nan Fu Rui and Qingdao FuDa Electronic at total cost of $ 302,103 for FOB shipping point at Qingdao, China.  The Company purchased Icemakers, motors, and parts from ChuZhou FuDa at total cost of $ 21,129,471 for FOB shipping point at Nanjing, China.  To manufacture the related refrigerator appliance parts, Chu Zhou Fu Da and Qingdao Fubida Electronic., needs key parts made in USA, which were purchased through Flurida Group, Inc. in USA. The costs of purchasing the parts were $3,367,289 in the period of January to December, 2013.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the Company had total purchase of $ 24,798,863.  At the periods ended December 31, 2013, the company had total ending inventory at a value $3,818,684.  For the period of January 1 to December 31, 2013, the company had freight cost and other related cost of $ 11,852.  Therefore, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred a total cost of goods sold of $ 23,270,498 which was increased 60 % comparing to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 cost of goods sold of $14,547,943.

As of December 31, 2013, the company had income taxes payable of $134,710.  Net Income (Loss)  We had a net income of $328,177 and $155,091 for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 respectively.  Commitments and Contingencies  The Company has signed a long-term distribution agreement with Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Zhong Nan Fu Rui is a Chinese manufacturing company which is related and managed by shareholder and director Jianfeng Ding. Also, on June 2008, the company signed a consigned inventory agreement with an US company, Electrolux Home Products DE Mexico and Anderson, S.A.DEC.V (Electrolux).  Foreign Currency Translation  The Company has determined the United States dollars to be its functional currency for Flurida Group USA and European Euro to be its functional currency in European business. Assets and liabilities were translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Statement of operations amounts were translated to U.S. dollars using the first date of each month during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders' equity.  Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31 At December 31 2013 2012 Current Ratio* 1.43 1.77 Cash $ 1,116,298 $ 194,265 Working Capital** $ 2,114,879 $ 1,637,866 Total Assets $ 7,313,737 $ 4,226,739 Total Liabilities $ 5,101,544 $ 2,393,148 Total Equity $ 2,212,193 $ 1,833,591 Total Debt/Equity*** 2.31 1.31  * Current Ratio = Current Assets /Current Liabilities ** Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities *** Total Debt / Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity.  The Company's overall working capital was increased in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 comparing to fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, due to the overall increase of the cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory; and, the Company's current ratio was decreased as December 31, 2013 comparing to 2012 due to the increase of the accounts receivable and accounts payable.  Currently the Company has a sales agreement with Electrolux, such agreement require the Company to supply the motors, ice makers, and other parts based on Electrolux's needs. However, due to the consignment arrangement with Electrolux, the Company would keep certain level of consignment inventory to meet the Electrolux's requirements. In addition, due to the consignment terms with Electrolux, the sales would be recognized when the Electrolux withdraw the products or the consignment inventory at Electrolux's warehouse for 60 days. In our due course of business dealing with Electrolux's consignment sales, all the sales incurred in 2012 were for the products withdrew before the 75 days terms,  Our activities for generating cash flows were operating activities in 2013 and 2012. The Company entered into a promissory note secured renewal loan agreement ("Loan Agreement") in the principal amount of $ 4,000,000 with East West Bank located in El Monte, CA. The maturity date of the Note was extended to July 10, 2014 with 4% annual interest rate. The loan is secured by all company inventories, accounts, equipment and general intangibles and certain other assets of the Company. The outstanding loan amount on this Loan Agreement is $ 1,900,000 as of December 31, 2013. The Company may only draw up to $ 2,000,000 on Sight Letters of Credit with maximum expiration date of 90 days from issuance, $ 2,000,000 on Standby Letters of Credit with maximum expiration date of one year from issuance and up to $ 4,000,000 on Clean Advance for up to 365 days. The remaining terms of the original loan are unchanged.  The management will continue to improve our current business on marketing, customer services and general administrative activities effectiveness; we still continually focus on developing our new products electronic ice maker.  We set up a R&D center at our California location. The primary function of an R&D group is to discover and create new knowledge about scientific and technological topics for the purpose of uncovering and enabling development of valuable new products, processes, and services. We are working on various products but none are fully developed and ready to market and we cannot assure you that any of the products we are working on will ever be fully developed or that we will be able to market or sell them in the future.  Specifically, the management still believes that within the operating activities, the efforts of collecting accounts receivables and making payments of accounts payables still are the primary factors for the changes of cash flows in the year 2013 and will continue in later years.  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 1,116,298 at December 31, 2013 and $ 2,114,879 of working capital and $ 194,265 at December 31, 2012 and $1,637,866 of working capital.  The total debt of $ 5,101,544 for December 31, 2013 included total of $ 2,326,317 for Chu Zhou Fu Da, $ 4,366 for Qingdao FuDa, $ 77,905 for Fulu Finance Management Limited, $ 234,104 for US suppliers, $ 156,796 for salary and payroll tax payable, and $ 53,823 for all other account payable, $ 134,710 income tax liabilities, and $ 138,522 unearned revenue $ 1,900,000 loan from the Bank, and $ 75,000 Other Payable.  Our independent auditor has indicated that our customer concentration may raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations. However, due to the close relationship between the Company and its supplier, Chuzhou Fu Da and Zhong Nan Fu Rui, which is closely related and directly managed by shareholder and director Jianfeng Ding. Besides, as of December 31, 2013, the cash and cash equivalent balance was $ 1,116,298, the management believes that the revenues will be generated and its cash flows will be maintained to cover its operational costs and the risk of going concern in long term is significantly low.  Interest Rate Risk  We do not have significant interest rate risk, as our debt obligations (i.e., notes payables to shareholders which can be converted to common stocks). The annual interest rate of notes payable is 8%, and the interest expense would be accrued if the notes were not converted to common shares, and the notes holders request the Company for repayment of principles plus the interest. Seven non-affiliated loan holders asked the Company for repayment of notes plus interest on April 1, 2008. All remaining loan holders converted their loans to common shares on April 15, 2008.
