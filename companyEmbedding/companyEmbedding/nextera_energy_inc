NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) is a Fortune 200 energy company with about 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, revenues of approximately $17 billion, and about 13,800 employees in 27 states and Canada. NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) is a Fortune 200 energy company with about 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, revenues of approximately $17 billion, and about 13,800 employees in 27 states and Canada. NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) is a Fortune 200 energy company with about 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, revenues of approximately $17 billion, and about 13,800 employees in 27 states and Canada. NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
