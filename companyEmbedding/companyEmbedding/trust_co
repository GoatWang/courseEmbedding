A trust company is a corporation, especially a commercial bank, organized to perform the fiduciary of trusts and agencies. It is normally owned by one of three types of structures: an independent partnership, a bank, or a law firm, each of which specializes in being a trustee of various kinds of trusts and in managing estates. Trust companies are not required to exercise all of the powers that they are granted. Further, the fact that a trust company in one jurisdiction does not perform all of the trust company duties in another jurisdiction is irrelevant and does not have any bearing on whether either company is truly a "trust company". Therefore, it is safe to say that the term "trust company" must not be narrowly construed.
The "trust" name refers to the ability of the institution's trust department to act as a trustee – someone who administers financial assets on behalf of another. The assets are typically held in the form of a trust, a legal instrument that spells out who the beneficiaries are and what the money can be spent for.
A trustee will manage investments, keep records, manage assets, prepare court accounting, pay bills (depending on the nature of the trust) medical expenses, charitable gifts, inheritances or other distributions of income and principal.[1]

Estate administration[edit]
A trust company can be named as an executor or personal representative in a last will and testament. The responsibilities of an executor in settling the estate of a deceased person include collecting debts, settling claims for debt and taxes, accounting for assets to the courts and distributing wealth to beneficiaries.
Estate planning is usually also offered to allow clients to structure their affairs so as to minimize inheritance taxes and probate costs. In the United States, one of the primary profit centers for a trust company is commissions earned from selling various types of insurance products designed to minimize the estate tax charged to a person.
A trust officer may provide guardian and conservator services, acting as guardian of a minor's property until adulthood or as conservator of the estate of an adult unable to handle his or her own finances.
Environmental and historic preservation trusts[edit]
Some trust companies are formed not merely for the benefit of a minor or an individual trustee, but for the preservation of nature or historic sites.
Asset management[edit]
A trust department provides investment management, including securities market advice, investment strategy and portfolio management, management of real estate and safekeeping of valuables.
Escrow services[edit]
The trust company may also provide escrow services, invest education or retirement funds or hold 1031 Exchange proceeds where cash from the sale of US real estate is held in trust (for tax purposes) until used to buy replacement land. The trust company also provide escrow facilities as an intermediary when it is for good to hold with it (on-behalf)something valuable till specific performance by parties not done as per agreed terms.
Corporate trust services[edit]
Trust companies may also perform corporate trust services. Corporate trust services are services which assist, in the fiduciary capacity, in the administration of the corporation's debt. For example, in a normal bank loan, the lender normally lends money to the company (usually with conditions called "covenants"), accepts payments from the company monthly, and monitors the financial conditions of the company to ensure that it is meeting all its agreed upon conditions (for example, that its ratio of profits to expenses stays above a certain amount). However most large companies borrow money not from banks, but by selling bonds. When the company sells bonds, a corporate trust company can handle the acceptance of payments from the company (which it passes on to the bondholders), and is the entity which monitors the company to ensure it is meeting covenants. In the event of the company's bankruptcy, the corporate trust company represents the interests of the bondholders and acts to recover as much of the loan proceeds as possible.

What size/style axe should I get?
Finding the right axe is a blend of your personal preferences and the task you'll be using it for. Most Trust Co. axes are of the "felling axe" variety – which are designed cut down trees with a slender shape that can cut against the grain. But, you can use them just as well making kindling for a backyard fire.
So that's maybe a long way of saying "it's up to you."
Can I send you an axe I have to be restored?
From time to time we do custom restorations. If you've got an axe that needs some loving care, drop us a line at info@trustco.us with some info and pictures so we can size up the job. 
How do I return my product?
Please contact us at orders@trustco.us to arrange your return.
Do you ship internationally?
Yes, if your country is not listed, please contact us for specific shipping costs: info@trustco.us
Can I put a custom mark/message on my product? How do I do that?
You absolutely can customize your Trust Co product with a name, logo, or some other meaningful inscription. 
If you're interested in a custom mark, you must contact us before you buy your product.info@trustco.us
We work with a partner company in Portland, OR to do all specialized marks, and need to determine pricing and lead time on a case-by-case basis. Bare minimum, it adds 4 weeks to the shipping turn around. If you're interested in a custom mark, contact us before you buy your product.
How do I care for my Trust Co. axe?
For a lifetime (or more) or use start with these basic steps:

Keep your axe clean and dry
Rub the handle down with linseed oil once or twice a year
Sharpen the blade as needed, using a metal file and some lubricating oil (wear protective gloves)

What happens if my Trust Co. product needs repairs?
 
Where is your shop located? How can I visit?

We Are Trustco Bank
Trustco, your Home Town Bank.
Trustco Bank has been the low cost provider of high quality products and services since opening for business in 1902 in the upstate town of Schenectady, New York. Throughout this time Trustco Bank has remained true to core banking principles and did not get caught up in any of the latest banking fads that have caused so many other banks to close their doors over the years. In 2002, the company began a large expansion, opening over 80 new branches in Central Florida, Massachusetts, downstate New York, New Jersey, and Vermont.Today, Trustco Bank has 144 branch locations, 51 of which are in the state of Florida. The Bank believes in old school, personal service and welcomes each customer by name as they enter the branch. Offering a wide variety of great deposit and loan products, the bank specializes in residential mortgage lending. As of December 31, 2013, Trustco Bank's assets were $4.6 Billion. Trustco Bank has paid dividends to its shareholders for over 100 consecutive years, and has remained profitable throughout its history, including the recent financial crisis. In May 2015, SNL Financial rated Trustco Bank the 12th best performing savings bank in the country. Trustco Bank is traded on the NASDAQ under TRST.

A captive is an insurance company which is typically owned (entirely or shared) by its parent company. Though it is your company, via insurance and reinsurance arrangements it is also a legitimate insurance company. As both the owner and insured you control the underwriting, claims and investment decisions of the insurance company. A number of different types of captives exist:

Single parent or group: All operations (underwriting, claims, actuary, etc.) maintained by your company.
Group captive: Pooling resources with other like-minded companies to share the overhead expense.
Rent-a-captive: Access to captive resources though usually with limited flexibility and ROI.
Agency captive: Owned by insurance agencies, usually for large blocks of business or specialty risk. Agent retains all benefit.
In addition to these basic captives, it's important to keep in mind that captives can be domiciled on or off-shore and can even maintain fronting arrangements with traditional insurers.  Such arrangements allow for clients to control their own program but purchase the rights to utilize another highly rates insurance company's name for contract purposes.

For most clients, a Member-Owned Group Captive is the ideal first step in this process. Group Captives provide the benefits of:
Potential Lower Costs
Control of Service & Management
Access to Data & Strategic Loss Control
Profit Sharing & Tax Advantages
While these benefits do look attractive Trustco clients do need to keep in mind a few items:
Long-term Commitment: Both financial and organizationally
Active Management: Executive team must be committed to safety and engaged in the process
Favorable Loss Ratio: Traditionally loss ratios of 50% or lower
Minimum Premium: Combined Liability & Work Comp premiums of $200,000
If you know you are wanting more control and a taste of the profits a group captive may be the best first step for you!
Dividend Programs
         For clients who meet the Group Captive profile but do not want the downside risk of the captive, or additional overhead, a Dividend Program may be ideal.  Dividend programs can also apply to Property Premiums along with Liability.  A sample dividend program may include:
         Loss Ratio of 0%-10%: 15% Net Premium Returned
Loss Ratio of 10%-20%: 10% Net Premium Returned 
Loss Ratio of 20%-30%: 5% Net Premium Returned 

In addition to no additional overhead a Dividend Program has the following benefits over a captive:
Reduced Timeframe: Captives take 3-5 years to provide dividends, ours are delivered next year.
Commitment: Captives generally require 3-5 years to receive captive contribution back.  They also require substantial management change.  Dividend programs can be changed annually at client discretion.
No Downside: If you suffer a catastrophic loss you will owe no additional funds or recapitalization.
Customized: Group captives require group consensus; our dividend programs allow you to customize as you see fit.
Alternative Risk
For clients with a pool of risks another option there are also Risk Retention Groups and Risk Purchasing Groups.  These function somewhat similarly, except that RRGs & RPGs pool insurance purchasing power and the group's data to negotiate exclusive rates, coverage, and control.  Though they function similarly the key difference is a captive maintains a portion of the risk while RPGs & RRGs transfer it all to an insurance company.

Stock Throughput

Modern-day insurance began at Lloyd's Coffee House in the 1700s where merchants would negotiate terms to manage the risk of their products being shipped.  At the time piracy was an issue, along with weather conditions and the uncertainty of foreign ports.  In some respects not much has really changed, though we as a people gotten much more sophisticated in causing disruptions.  Stock Throughput insurance is a the modern-day version of original cargo insurance.

Am I at Risk?
Stock Throughput's coverage is self contained in its name; its role is to cover your inventory & stock all throughout the entire process. For some clients this may include sourcing berries in Bolivia, shipping some to the US and others to Japan, processing them at third-party manufacturer's who forward parts on to a bottling company, who holds the bottles and provides fulfillment. From there it may be stored in owned or third-party warehouses and eventually delivered to the end user. Throughout this process the product is occasionally in client's control, but it is always a supply chain risk to the client should something go awry. In our experience we are yet to see a third-party provide full coverage for clients good's in the care. Though you may not have control of it, nor have taken title, it may still harm you financially in a loss.
Coverage
Coverage includes strikes, riots, war, and other civil unrest. Should your company  be shipping, manufacturing, or sourcing goods overseas they are covered anywhere in the world. When we say anywhere we do include, China, Afghanistan, Iraq, and even the bottom of the Arctic Ocean! Perishable goods distributors  are covered for spoilage caused by any virtually anything. Earthquakes, flood, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks... all can be covered.
Clients utilizing third party manufacturers, outsourced warehousing & fulfillment may also insure their products while in the Care, Custody or Control of others.  This can apply anywhere in the world regardless of political status.  Additionally further coverage is available should a crucial supplier or manufacturer suffer a loss which delays the client's business. Other equipment can all be insured at replacement value, not actual (depreciated) value. 
Market Segments
Coverage is available to all customers, however those that gain the highest benefit are outlined below. Coverage is provided SALES VALUATION, thus your profit is included should any physical harm befall inventory.  Traditional coverage insures at book value, we prefer to make you whole. Target industries include:

Manufacturers
Wholesalers
Retailers
Distributors
Import/Export
Technology
Oil & Gas
Energy
Mining
Perishable Goods

Cost 
Due to combining Property, Cargo & Inland Marine policies into one Stock Policy most of our clients recognize a net premium decrease. For clients who do not have existing coverage this can often be procured at $1 per $1,000 of product, or 0.1%.
 Let us show you how we can extend your stock coverage with no increased costs by contacting us!

Financial: Credit Insurance

Guaranteed Payment

Example
          Company's profit margin is 5% and one of its customer's default on a debt of $100,000, the company will have to produce additional sales of $2,000,000 to make up for the lost profits. More importantly, the lost cash flow could be devastating.
Every business should have a strategy in place to manage bad-debt losses. On average 40% of a company's assets are in the form of trade debts. Predicting which clients will default, even with DnB reports and bank references, is very difficult. Close to 50% of all payment defaults arise from customers with whom stable and long-term trade relationships have been established. 
A trade credit insurance policy helps manage your accounts receivable and compensates you in the event of non-payment.
Trade Credit  or Accounts Receivable Insurance can guarantee between 80% up to 100% of your invoice amount is paid. Payment can be guaranteed due to insolvency, protracted default (disputed payments) or political risk & currency devaluation. For most policies, claims are paid within 60 days of filing and notification of claim.
Strategic Marketing
You're Approved! 
  We've all been there, you're offering the client the best deal, it meets all their needs, but you can't get credit terms negotiated!  At Trustco, we like to provide the tools to transform this obstacle into an advantage.  With Trustco's Trade Credit Insurance you can send your salesforce out to prospects & clients with payment terms pre-approved!  No longer worry about structuring trade and focus on what makes you unique! 
Pre-Approval
  If you are already offering credit terms to a large block of clients Trustco can help you extend your offering and simplify the approval process. For many of Trustco's clients we provide a blanket limit that applies to all purchasers under $50,000. This means anyone with outstanding invoices of less than $50,000 can automatically be approved for trade terms! For some clients this means an immediate growth of 30% due to payment terms, for others it means reducing the number of people on the credit approval team.

HCIT Earthquake & Flood

Doesn't my homeowner's cover that?
Have you ever wondered what would happen if a devastating earthquake struck your neighborhood? At Trustco we've had many customers over the year wonder how their home is covered due from earthquakes, floods, landslides and other catastrophic events.  In 1975 Trustco formed the Homeowners Catastrophe Insurance Trust (HCIT).  HCIT provides an economical approach to covering these major perils, principally earthquake,  flood and landslide. The program provides property protection for losses from disasters such as these, most of which are not covered on homeowners' policies.

        Franchisor Benefits
Insurance Compliance: Utilizing TrustCert our Franchisors are able to verify that franchisee insurance is (1) current, (2) accurate, and (3) contains required endorsements.  This is provided whether Franchisee purchases coverage through our program or maintains independent insurance.
Group Pricing: For specialty groups or high-risk operations a franchise program can dramatically decrease costs (and availability).  For all groups, large participation can quickly reduce rates.
Simplified Procurement: Because we underwrite the group individual enrollment becomes simply.  Most groups recognize a one page policy where they make their requests and confirm their franchise status
Dividend Opportunities: For some groups in certain jurisdictions dividend options are available.  Thus as your franchise continues to purchase coverage and maintain good safety the Franchisor (or designated beneficiary) can reap the benefits
