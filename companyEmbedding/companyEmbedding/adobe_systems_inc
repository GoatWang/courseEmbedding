Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

SoftMan Products Co. v. Adobe Systems





Court
United States District Court for the Central District of California


Full case name
SoftMan Products Company, LLC v. Adobe Systems Inc., et al.


Decided
October 19, 2001


Citation(s)
171 F. Supp.2d 1075; 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17723; 45 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d (Callaghan) 945


Case history


Prior action(s)
Preliminary injunction entered for plaintiff, 9-10-01


Subsequent action(s)
none


Case opinions


Plaintiff software company's product was sold rather than licensed to the defendant, who was therefore entitled to resell it in separate components. The defendant was not bound by the software "shrinkwrap license" (or End User License Agreement) because the terms of that license were never assented to. Preliminary injunction previously entered for the plaintiff was vacated, and a new injunction denied.


Court membership


Judge(s) sitting
Dean D. Pregerson


SoftMan Products Co. v. Adobe Systems Inc. was a lawsuit heard in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in 2001 by Judge Dean D. Pregerson.
Adobe Systems contended in a counterclaim that the original plaintiff, SoftMan, distributed unauthorized Adobe software, specifically Adobe Educational software and sold individual units the software titles that were purchased from Adobe as a single boxed "Collection". Adobe claimed that these actions are infringing Adobe's copyright and violate Adobe's terms of service. Adobe also alleged SoftMan of trademark violation by distributing incomplete versions of their software.
Judge Pregerson ruled that Adobe has sold its software instead of licensed the software. Thus under the first-sale doctrine, Adobe can not control how SoftMan resells those particular copies of Adobe software after the initial sale. The Court also found that SoftMan had not infringed on the EULA because SoftMan had never run the program and therefore never assented to the terms. In addition, the Court found that factual disputes exist on whether the separately sold copies are materially different from the original copies, which is central to Adobe's trademark claim. Since Adobe was unable to demonstrate a likelihood of success on both copyright and trademark claims, the Court denied Adobe's application for a preliminary injunction against SoftMan.

Background[edit]
Adobe produces a suite of publishing software. SoftMan sells various software through its website, including individual copies of Adobe software that was originally part of a bundle. Adobe claims such sales are unauthorized and SoftMan is infringing both Adobe's copyright and violating terms of service that is embedded in each Adobe Software. The users need to agree to these EULA to install the software. In addition, Adobe claims that SoftMan is distributing Adobe software that is not genuine, because unbundled software does not give the customers access to Adobe's support services. Based on the aforementioned claims, Adobe applied for a preliminary injunction.
Copyright and EULA claim[edit]
In response to Adobe's claim, SoftMan argues that first sale doctrine allows SoftMan to unbundle and sell the Adobe software without Adobe's restrictions. Adobe asserts that it does not sell any software, rather it licenses its end users the software. Furthermore, the EULA attached to each copy of the software prohibits the "licensee" to unbundle the software.
The court disagrees with Adobe's assertion. Since the purchaser pays a fixed fee to obtain the rights to use the software for an indefinite period of time and also accepts the risk commonly associated with a sale, the court determines the transactions between Adobe and SoftMan are sales. Thus, first sale doctrine applies and Adobe's copyright claims are rejected.
In response to Adobe's claim that SoftMan violated terms of service described in the EULA, the court decides that SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because there was no assent. However, the court declines to comment on the general issue of shrinkwrap licenses.
Trademark claim[edit]
Adobe claims that the software sold by SoftMan is not genuine and is infringing on its trademark. SoftMan admits that it repackages the unbundled Adobe Software using Adobe logo. This is not considered trademark infringement under the first sale doctrine. However, the first sale doctrine does not protect any product that is "materially different" from the genuine product. Adobe argues that the resold software lacks customer and technical support that comes with original bundle. SoftMan disputes this and claims individual software can be registered separately and receive support. Since this dispute exist and not issuing an injunction is likely not going to cause irreparable injury to Adobe, the preliminary injunction is denied.

This matter comes before the Court on the counter-claimant Adobe's application for a preliminary injunction. After reviewing and considering the materials submitted by the parties, and hearing oral argument, the Court adopts the following order.
I. Background
The counter-claimant Adobe Systems Inc. ("Adobe") is a leading software development and publishing company. The counter-defendant SoftMan Products Company ("SoftMan") is a Los Angeles-based company that distributes computer software products primarily through its website,  www.buycheapsoftware.com. Adobe alleges that since at least November 1997, SoftMan has distributed unauthorized Adobe software, including Adobe Educational software1 and unbundled Adobe "Collections."2 By distributing the individual pieces of Adobe Collections, Adobe contends that SoftMan is infringing Adobe's copyright in these products and violating the terms of Adobe's licenses. While SoftMan agrees that it is breaking apart various Adobe Collections and distributing the individual pieces of them as single products, SoftMan claims that it is entitled to distribute Adobe software in this manner. There is no direct contractual relationship between Adobe and SoftMan.
Adobe distributes its products through "licensing" agreements with distributors.3 Each piece of Adobe software is also accompanied by an End User License Agreement ("EULA"), which sets forth the terms of the license between Adobe and the end user for that specific Adobe product. The EULA is electronically recorded on the computer disk and customers are asked to agree to its terms when they attempt to install the software. (SoftMan Opp. at 4.)
Adobe alleges, among other things, that SoftMan has infringed on Adobe's trademark by distributing incomplete versions of Adobe software. The central difference between these allegedly incomplete products and the genuine Adobe software is that when SoftMan unbundles a Collection and resells its component parts, such individual pieces of software may not be accompanied by the registration information which would entitle the bearer access to Adobe's customer support and technical services. Adobe alleges that customers may be confused about the connection between authentic Adobe software and the unauthorized versions distributed by SoftMan because a consumer may acquire a product from SoftMan as a "Retail" version when, in fact, it is a piece of an unbundled Adobe Collection.
On August 27, 2001, this Court granted a temporary restraining order and seizure order against SoftMan. On September 10, 2001, the Court entered a preliminary injunction, to be in effect for the duration of the Court's review of the supplemental briefing submitted by the parties following oral argument.
II. Legal Standard
"A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show `either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor.'" Micro Star v. Formgen Inc., 154 F.3d 1107,  1109 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Sys., Inc., 886 F.2d 1173, 1174 (9th Cir. 1989)). In granting a preliminary injunction, a district court must find that the movant demonstrated either: (1) a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury if relief is not granted, or (2) the existence of serious questions going to the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1046 (9th Cir.1999). Irreparable injury may be presumed from a showing of likelihood of success on the merits of a trademark infringement claim. Id. at 1066 (citing Metro Publ'g v. San Jose Mercury News, 987 F.2d 637, 640 (9th Cir.1993)). The traditional test for granting preliminary injunctive relief also applies in the context of a trademark action. This test requires the plaintiff to demonstrate: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a significant threat of irreparable injury; (3) that the balance of hardships favors the plaintiff; and (4) whether any public interest favors granting an injunction. Dollar Rent A Car v. Travelers Indem. Co., 774 F.2d 1371, 1374 (9th Cir.1985); see also Schwarzer, et al., Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, § 13:44 (1999). The Ninth Circuit also uses an alternative test which requires the plaintiff to demonstrate "serious questions going to the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor." See First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 809 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1987).
III. Discussion
A. Copyright Infringement Claim
1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits
To prevail on its copyright infringement claim, Adobe must show (1) that it owns the copyright to the product at issue, and (2) that SoftMan infringed Adobe's copyrights in these products. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175. With respect to the second element, Adobe may prove infringement by showing that SoftMan has violated one of Adobe's exclusive rights guaranteed to copyright holders under 17 U.S.C. § 106(3).4 Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984).
a. Copyright Ownership
Adobe's products consist of original material which is copyrightable subject matter under 17 U.S.C. § 102. There is no dispute that Adobe is the registered owner of the copyrights for all the products in question in this action.
b. Unauthorized Copying of a Protected Work
Copyright infringement exists when any of the rights granted under 17 U.S.C. § 106 are violated. Buck v. Jewell-La Salle Realty, 283 U.S. 191, 51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed. 971 (1931). Title 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) grants a copyright holder the exclusive right to distribute, and to authorize distribution of, its copyrighted work. Adobe chooses to distribute copies of its products through licensing agreements with various distributors and dealers.5 It  is not disputed that SoftMan has no licensing agreement with Adobe.
In addition, each piece of Adobe software is accompanied by the EULA.6 Once the products are distributed to the enduser, the EULA prohibits the individual distribution of software that was originally distributed as part of a Collection. Specifically, the Adobe EULA provides that the end user may "transfer all [his] rights to the Use of the Software to another person or legal entity provided that (a) [he] also transfer this Agreement, the Software and all other software or hardware bundled or pre-installed with the Software."7 (Palma Decl., Ex. 1.)
In this case, Adobe alleges that by distributing unbundled Collections, SoftMan has exceeded the scope of the EULA and has infringed Adobe's copyrights, specifically Adobe's § 106 right to distribute and control distribution. SoftMan contends that the first sale doctrine allows for the resale of Adobe's Collection software.
(1) First Sale Doctrine
The "first sale" doctrine was first analyzed by the United States Supreme Court in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339, 28 S.Ct. 722, 52 L.Ed. 1086 (1908). The Court held that the exclusive right to "vend" under the copyright statute applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work. The doctrine has been codified at 17 U.S.C. § 109(a). It states in relevant part: "the owner of a particular copy ... lawfully made under this title ... is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy." 17 U.S.C. § 109(a). One significant effect of § 109(a) is to limit the exclusive right to distribute copies to their first voluntary disposition, and thus negate copyright owner control over further or "downstream" transfer to a third party. Quality King Distrib. v. L'anza Research Int'l, Inc., 523 U.S. 135, 142-44, 118 S.Ct. 1125, 140 L.Ed.2d 254 (1998). (See Rice Decl. ¶ 11.) The first sale doctrine vests the copy owner with statutory privileges under the Act which operate as  limits on the exclusive rights of the copyright owners.
Adobe argues that the first sale doctrine does not apply because Adobe does not sell or authorize any sale of its software. Adobe characterizes each transaction throughout the entire stream of commerce as a license.8 Adobe asserts that its license defines the relationship between Adobe and any third-party such that a breach of the license constitutes copyright infringement. This assertion is not accurate because copyright law in fact provides certain rights to owners of a particular copy. This grant of rights is independent from any purported grant of rights from Adobe. The Adobe license compels third-parties to relinquish rights that the third-parties enjoy under copyright law.9
In short, the terms of the Adobe EULA at issue prohibit licensees from transferring or assigning any individual Adobe product that was originally distributed as part of a Collection unless it is transferred with all the software in the original Collection. This license provision conflicts with the first sale doctrine in copyright law, which gives the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted work the right to dispose of that copy without the permission of the copyright owner.
(2) Sale v. License
(a) Historical Background
Historically, the purpose of "licensing" computer program copy use was to employ contract terms to augment trade secret protection in order to protect against unauthorized copying at a time when, first, the existence of a copyright in computer programs was doubtful, and, later, when the extent to which copyright provided protection was uncertain. (See Rice Decl. ¶ 6.) Computer program copy use "licensing" continued after federal courts interpreted the Copyright Act to provide substantial protection for computer programs as literary works. (Id. at ¶ 7.) In Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, the Third Circuit examined the historical development of the use of licensing in the software industry and concluded that subsequent changes to the Copyright Act had rendered the need to characterize the transaction as a license "largely anachronistic." 939 F.2d 91, 96 n. 7 (3d Cir.1991).10
 (b) Adobe Sells its Software
A number of courts have held that the sale of software is the sale of a good within the meaning of Uniform Commercial Code. Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp., 925 F.2d 670, 676 (3d Cir.1991); Step-Saver, 939 F.2d at 99-100; Downriver Internists v. Harris Corp., 929 F.2d 1147, 1150 (6th Cir.1991). It is well-settled that in determining whether a transaction is a sale, a lease, or a license, courts look to the economic realities of the exchange. Microsoft Corp. v. DAK Indus., 66 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.1995); United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180 (9th Cir.1977). In DAK, Microsoft and DAK entered into a license agreement granting DAK certain nonexclusive license rights to Microsoft's computer software. The agreement provided that DAK would pay a royalty rate per copy of computer software that it distributed. Subsequently, DAK filed a petition for bankruptcy, and failed to pay the final two out of a total of five installments. Microsoft filed a motion for the payment of an administrative expense, claiming that it should be compensated for DAK's postbankruptcy petition use of the license agreement. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the economic realities of the agreement indicated that it was a sale, not a license to use. Thus, Microsoft simply held an unsecured claim and not an administrative expense. The court found that the agreement was best characterized as a lump sum sale of software units to DAK, rather than a grant of permission to use an intellectual property. The court in DAK noted:
Because we look to the economic realities of the agreement, the fact that the agreement labels itself a "license" and calls the payments "royalties," both terms that arguably imply periodic payment for the use rather than sale of technology, does not control our analysis.
DAK, 66 F.3d at 1095, n. 2. Other courts have reached the same conclusion: software is sold and not licensed. See, e.g., RRX Indus., Inc. v. Lab-Con, Inc., 772 F.2d 543, 546 (9th Cir.1985); Applied Info. Mgmt., Inc. v. Icart, 976 F.Supp. 149, 155 (E.D.N.Y.1997) (finding that whether a transaction denominated a "license" was in fact a sale conveying ownership was a disputed question of fact); Novell, Inc. v. CPU Distrib., Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 9975 (S.D.Tex.2000). In Novell, a software manufacturer was pursuing a discount retailer for copyright infringement. Like Adobe, CPU argued that it purchased the software from an authorized source and was entitled to resell it under the first sale doctrine. Novell claimed that it did not sell software but merely licensed it to distribution partners. The court held that these transactions constituted sales and not a license, and therefore that the first sale doctrine applied. 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 9975 at *18.
Adobe frames the issue as a dispute about the ownership of intellectual property. In fact, it is a dispute about the ownership of individual pieces of Adobe software. Section 202 of the Copyright Act recognizes a distinction between tangible  property rights in copies of the work and intangible property rights in the creation itself.11 In this case, no claim is made that transfer of the copy involves transfer of the ownership of the intellectual property within. (See SoftMan's Suppl. Brief at 9-10) ("Adobe has ownership rights in the copyright of [its] software."). What is at stake here is the right of the purchaser to dispose of that purchaser's particular copy of the software.
The Court finds that the circumstances surrounding the transaction strongly suggests that the transaction is in fact a sale rather than a license. For example, the purchaser commonly obtains a single copy of the software, with documentation, for a single price, which the purchaser pays at the time of the transaction, and which constitutes the entire payment for the "license." The license runs for an indefinite term without provisions for renewal. In light of these indicia, many courts and commentators conclude that a "shrinkwrap license" transaction is a sale of goods rather than a license.12
The reality of the business environment also suggests that Adobe sells its software to distributors. Adobe transfers large amounts of merchandise to distributors. The distributors pay full value for the merchandise and accept the risk that the software may be damaged or lost.13 The distributors also accept the risk that they will be unable to resell the product.14 The distributors then resell the product to other distributors in the secondary market. The secondary market and the ultimate consumer also pay full value for the product, and accept the risk that the product may be lost or damaged. This evidence suggests a transfer of title in the good. The transfer of a product for consideration with a transfer of title and risk of loss generally constitutes a sale. VWP of Am., Inc. v. United States, 175 F.3d 1327, 1338-39  (Fed.Cir.1999). Professor Raymond Nimmer writes:
Ownership of a copy should be determined based on the actual character, rather than the label, of the transaction by which the user obtained possession. Merely labeling a transaction as a lease or license does not control. If a transaction involves a single payment giving the buyer an unlimited period in which it has a right to possession, the transaction is a sale. In this situation, the buyer owns the copy regardless of the label the parties use for the contract. Course of dealing and trade usage may be relevant, since they establish the expectations and intent of the parties. The pertinent issue is whether, as in a lease, the user may be required to return the copy to the vendor after the expiration of a particular period. If not, the transaction conveyed not only possession, but also transferred ownership of the copy.
Raymond Nimmer, The Law of Computer Technology § 1.18[1] p. 1-103 (1992). The Court agrees that a single payment for a perpetual transfer of possession is, in reality, a sale of personal property and therefore transfers ownership of that property, the copy of the software.
Other commentators have urged courts to look at the substance rather than the form of licensing agreements. See, e.g., David A. Rice, Licensing the Use of Computer Program Copies and the Copyright Act First Sale Doctrine, 30 Jurimetrics J. 157 (1990). In particular, the following factors require a finding that distributing software under licenses transfers individual copy ownership: temporally unlimited possession, absence of time limits on copy possession, pricing and payment schemes that are unitary not serial, licenses under which subsequent transfer is neither prohibited nor conditioned on obtaining the licensor's prior approval (only subject to a prohibition against rental and a requirement that any transfer be of the entity), and licenses under which the use restrictions principal purpose is to protect intangible copyrightable subject matter, and not to preserve property interests in individual program copies. Id. at 172.
Adobe relies primarily on two cases to support its proposition that software is licensed and not sold. In Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers & Elecs., Inc., 846 F.Supp. 208, 212 (E.D.N.Y.1994), the court assumed without analysis that the transaction was a license rather than a sale and held that distribution outside the scope of a license agreement constituted copyright infringement. The Court finds Harmony's facts to be distinguishable. In that case, the defendants were selling counterfeit Microsoft products. Here, Adobe does not allege that SoftMan sells counterfeit Adobe software.
Adobe also relies on Adobe Sys. Inc. v. One Stop Micro, Inc., 84 F.Supp.2d 1086, 1093 (N.D.Cal.2000). The court held that One Stop's distribution of Educational versions of Adobe software to non-educational end users was outside the scope of Adobe's license and in violation of Adobe's exclusive right to distribute under § 106(3). In One Stop, an unlicensed reseller admitted to adulterating the packaging for Adobe Educational software and transferring it as retail Adobe products for prices below the street price of the retail product. Id. The court further held that One Stop could not claim to have title for first sale purposes while the end user only obtained a license. The Court finds the facts of One Stop to be distinguishable from the instant case. In One Stop, the issue was peeling off and destroying the "Education version" stickers on software, as well as destroying bar code and serial numbers on the software, and then reselling it as commercial software. Id. at 1088. To the extent that the court in One Stop found that the transaction at issue was in fact a license, and not a  sale, this Court simply declines to adopt that analysis. In One Stop, the court placed great weight on the declarations of Adobe's experts that licensing is the preferred method of distributing software. The Court understands fully why licensing has many advantages for software publishers. However, this preference does not alter the Court's analysis that the substance of the transaction at issue here is a sale and not a license.
(c) EULA Terms
Adobe argues that the EULA requires construction of the transaction as a license rather than a sale. The Court finds that SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because there was no assent to its terms.
i) Assent
Adobe contends that the EULA limits the consumer's ability to transfer the software after buying it. According to SoftMan, a hard copy of the EULA agreement is not enclosed with the individual Adobe software disk. Instead, consumers are asked to agree to its terms as part of the installation process. (Dracup Decl. ¶ 7.)
Courts have required that assent to the formation of a contract be manifested in some way, by words or other conduct, if the contract is to be effective. E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts § 3.1 (2d ed.2000). As the court noted in Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 150 F.Supp.2d 585 (S.D.N.Y.2001): "The case law on software licensing has not eroded the importance of assent in contract formation. Mutual assent is the bedrock of any agreement to which the law will give force. Defendants' position, if accepted, would so expand the definition of assent as to render it meaningless." Id. at 596.
In the instant case, the Court finds that there is only assent on the part of the consumer, if at all, when the consumer loads the Adobe program and begins the installation process. It is undisputed that SoftMan has never attempted to load the software that it sells. Consequently, the Court finds that SoftMan is not subject to the Adobe EULA.
Adobe fails to offer a compelling rationale for how SoftMan becomes subject to Adobe's licenses if SoftMan never loads the software onto computers. Adobe claims that the EULA is enforceable against SoftMan because the boxes containing Adobe software (including Collections) clearly indicate that use is subject to the consumer's agreement to the terms contained in EULA inside. See, e.g., ProCD, 86 F.3d at 1451. Like the CD boxes in ProCD, Adobe's EULAs state that the product can be returned if the terms are not agreed to by the end user. The Adobe Collections boxes state: "NOTICE TO USERS: This product is offered subject to the license agreement included with the media." (Navarro Decl. at p. 2.) However, the existence of this notice on the box cannot bind SoftMan. Reading a notice on a box is not equivalent to the degree of assent that occurs when the software is loaded onto the computer and the consumer is asked to agree to the terms of the license.
Adobe further asserts that whether SoftMan is characterized as a distributor or reseller, SoftMan would be bound by the terms of these license agreements, which state that Adobe retains ownership of its software products, as well as the media upon which these software products are distributed. It is undisputed that SoftMan is not a signatory to any licensing agreements. Yet Adobe claims that although SoftMan has never signed an agreement with Adobe, the terms of Adobe's distribution agreements all apply to SoftMan.
In One Stop, the court stated that although One Stop was not a signatory to an  Adobe licensing agreement, it was nevertheless subject to the restrictions of those agreements. 84 F.Supp.2d at 1092. The court found that by obtaining Adobe software from a party to an Adobe licensing agreement, One Stop was bound by any restrictions imposed by that agreement. Id. at 1093. In Harmony, the court found that "to the extent that defendants bought their Microsoft Products from authorized Microsoft licensees, they were subject to the same licensing restrictions under which those licensees operated." Harmony, 846 F.Supp. at 213. The Court declines to adopt the analysis of these cases.
The Court finds that Adobe's EULA cannot be valid without assent. Therefore, SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because it has never loaded the software, and therefore never assented to its terms of use.
ii) Shrinkwrap Licenses In General
Whether contracts such as Adobe's EULA, often referred to as "shrinkwrap" licenses, are valid is a much-disputed question.15 A number of courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license have found them to be invalid, characterizing them as contracts of adhesion, unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. Step-Saver, 939 F.2d 91; Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd., 847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir.1988). These courts have refused to recognize a bargain in shrinkwrap license that is not signed by the party against whom it is enforced. In Step-Saver, the Third Circuit found that the terms of a contract were formed when the parties shipped, received and paid for the product. Therefore, the software shrinkwrap agreement constituted additional terms to the contract, and under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-207 (governing commercial counter-offers), these terms were invalid without express assent by the purchaser. In contrast, other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license is valid and enforceable. ProCD, 86 F.3d at 1453; Harmony, 846 F.Supp. at 212.
The Court finds it unnecessary to reach the question of the general validity of shrinkwrap licenses at this stage because the Court has determined that SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because there was no assent to its terms.
2. New York Times Co., Inc. v. Tasini
Adobe claims that even if there was a first sale of the Adobe Collections, SoftMan's unbundling of the Collections and redistribution of the individual component parts still constitutes copyright infringement. Adobe cites New York Times Co. Inc. v. Tasini, ___ U.S. ___, 121 S.Ct. 2381, 150 L.Ed.2d 500 (2001), for the proposition that the distribution of an individual component of a collective work infringes the copyright in the underlying individual work.
In Tasini, the Court held that print and electronic publishers infringed on the copyrights of freelance authors when the publishers placed the authors' articles in electronic databases. The Court rejected the publishers' assertions that they were protected by the reproduction and distribution privilege accorded collective work copyright owners by 17 U.S.C. § 201(c).16  Adobe's reliance on Tasini is misplaced. The critical distinction is that Tasini does not address, as does the instant case, the fate of an individual copy of any work under the first sale doctrine. The Tasini Court reaffirmed that the owner of the copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work.17
In contrast, what Adobe alleges here is quite different. In this case, Adobe seeks to control the resale of a lawfully acquired copy of its software. Adobe's position in this action would be more akin to a journalist who claimed that ownership of the copyright to an article allowed him or her to control the resale of a particular copy of a newspaper that contained that article. The Court finds that Tasini is not applicable to the facts at issue.
3. Copyright Infringement Conclusion
In short, the transfer of copies of Adobe software making up the distribution chain from Adobe to SoftMan are sales of the particular copies, but not of Adobe's intellectual rights in the computer program itself, which is protected by Adobe's copyright. SoftMan is an "owner" of the copy and is entitled to the use and enjoyment of the software, with the rights that are consistent with copyright law. The Court rejects Adobe's argument that the EULA gives to purchasers only a license to use the software. The Court finds that SoftMan has not assented to the EULA and therefore cannot be bound by its terms. Therefore, the Court finds that Adobe has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright infringement claim.
a. Irreparable Injury
Since the Court finds that Adobe has not made a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of its copyright claim, no presumption of irreparable harm is raised. See Micro Star, 154 F.3d at 1109. Parties seeking pretrial injunctive relief must demonstrate they will be exposed to some "significant risk of irreparable injury" if such relief is denied. Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. Coalition for Econ. Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1410 (9th Cir.1991). Before a preliminary injunction may issue, the court must identify the harm which a preliminary injunction might cause the defendant and balance it against plaintiff's threatened injury. Armstrong v. Mazurek, 94 F.3d 566, 568 (9th Cir.1996).
Adobe contends it will suffer irreparable injury for the following reasons: dilution of customer goodwill, price erosion of Adobe software due to SoftMan's resale activities, the Adobe name will be tarnished and consumers may stop acquiring Adobe products, loss of annual sales,18 and dilution of trademarks. Adobe also contends that it is faced with a "Hobson's Choice" between upholding distribution agreements and denying consumers Adobe  services (satisfying Adobe's "legitimate" distribution partners at the expense of customer goodwill), or providing services to consumers holding so-called "pirated" products.
Irreparable injury and probability of success on the merits "are not really two entirely separate tests, but that they are merely extremes of a single continuum." Benda v. Grand Lodge of Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 584 F.2d 308, 315 (9th Cir.1978). In this case, the Court finds that Adobe has not demonstrated probable success on the merits of its copyright claim. Nor has Adobe made a showing of irreparable injury sufficient to obtain preliminary injunctive relief. Adobe presents no specific evidence relating to dilution of customer goodwill or the direct loss of annual sales. There must be evidence of actual injury to support claims of "irreparable injury." Speculative losses are insufficient. Goldie's Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, 739 F.2d 466, 472 (9th Cir.1984); Caribbean Marine Serv. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir.1988). Significantly, Adobe also admits that it discovered SoftMan's allegedly unauthorized distribution of Adobe software in November 1997. (Adobe Mot. at 6.) This delay further supports the Court's conclusion that Adobe has failed to demonstrate immediate threatened harm. The Court finds that Adobe has failed to show that it will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief.
b. Balance of Hardships
In deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the Court may also balance the potential hardships that each party may suffer if the Court grants or denies Adobe's motion. See International Jensen, Inc. v. Metrosound U.S.A., 4 F.3d at 819, 827 (9th Cir.1993). Given that neither Adobe nor SoftMan has submitted any evidence of economic loss except broad, general statements, the Court considers the balance of hardships to be a neutral factor.
c. Public Interest
Traditionally, courts have looked to public policy considerations in determining whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief. Chalk v. United States Dist. Court, Cent. Dist. of Cal., 840 F.2d 701, 711 (9th Cir., 1988) ("We recognize that the public interest is one of the traditional equitable criteria which a court should consider in granting injunctive relief."). In this case, the Court finds that important public policy considerations weigh on each side.
The Court finds that the provisions contained in Adobe's EULA purport to diminish the rights of customers to use the software in ways ordinarily enjoyed by customers under copyright law. Therefore, these restrictions appear to be inconsistent with the balance of rights set forth in intellectual property law.19 Commentators have noted that the arguments for enforcing this balance are particularly persuasive in the context of shrinkwrap licenses because the balance of rights in intellectual  property law is already tilted heavily in favor of the intellectual property owner. "The only countervailing forces favoring users are those rights specifically granted to users by federal law. In this context more than any other, therefore, it is justifiable to fear that removing or eviscerating those user rights may bring the whole edifice crumbling down."20
This is an area fraught with conflicting policy considerations. Software publishers are desirous of augmenting the protections offered under copyright law. In this case, through the use of licensing, Adobe seeks a vast and seemingly unlimited power to control prices and all channels of distribution. On the other hand, in the absence of copyright law violations, the market can often best regulate prices and all subsequent transactions that occur after the first sale. Sound policy rationales support the analysis of those courts that have found shrinkwrap licenses to be unenforceable. A system of "licensing" which grants software publishers this degree of unchecked power to control the market deserves to be the object of careful scrutiny.
For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of the counter-defendants.
B. Trademark Claims
1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits
To prevail on its trademark infringement claims under the Lanham Act, Adobe must prove: (1) that it is the owner of a protectible trademark, and (2) a likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source, sponsorship, or origin of the goods. Ocean Garden, Inc. v. Marktrade Co., Inc., 953 F.2d 500, 506 (9th Cir.1991).
a. Validity of Adobe's Marks
Under the Lanham Act, registration of a trademark "shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff, who would have to establish his right to exclusive use," to the defendant, who must rebut the presumption of the plaintiff's right to protected use. Vuitton et Fils S.A. v. J. Young Enters., Inc., 644 F.2d 769, 775 (9th Cir.1981). All of Adobe's trademarks at issue in this suit are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. SoftMan does not dispute that the Adobe trademarks are valid, protectible marks.
b. Likelihood of Confusion
Courts apply an eight-factor test in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists between the plaintiff's mark and the allegedly infringing mark. The relevant factors may include:
1. strength of the mark;
2. proximity of the goods;
3. similarity of the marks;
4. evidence of actual confusion;
5. marketing channels used;
6. type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser;
7. defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and
8. likelihood of expansion of the product lines.
AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir.1979). In applying the Sleekcraft factors, the Ninth Circuit has cautioned that although all of the factors are relevant, some factors may be more significant depending upon the facts of the case at bar. See Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1053. Further, the Sleekcraft court noted that it did not provide an exhaustive list of relevant factors. "Other variables may come into play depending on  the particular facts presented." Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 348 n. 11.
Evidence of actual confusion is not necessary in order to establish a likelihood of confusion. See id. at 353 (stating that failure to prove actual confusion is not dispositive); Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss & Co., 799 F.2d 867, 874 (2d Cir.1986). "In assessing the likelihood of confusion to the public, the standard used by the courts is the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution." Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353. As the Sleekcraft court explained, "[w]hen the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another's, reviewing courts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose: that is, that the public will be deceived." Id. at 354. The court also noted that, "[g]ood faith is less probative of the likelihood of confusion, yet may be given considerable weight in fashioning a remedy." Id.
In the instant case, the parties do not dispute that SoftMan is reselling genuine, albeit repackaged, Adobe software. The resale of genuine trademarked goods generally does not constitute infringement. See, e.g., NEC Elecs. v. CAL Circuit Abco, 810 F.2d 1506, 1509 (9th Cir.1987). Under the first sale doctrine, resale by the first purchaser of the original article under the producer's trademark is generally neither trademark infringement nor unfair competition. See Sebastian Int'l, Inc. v. Longs Drug Stores Corp., 53 F.3d 1073, 1074 (9th Cir.1995). The rationale behind the rule is that "trademark law is designed to prevent sellers from confusing or deceiving consumers about the origin or make of a product, which confusion ordinarily does not exist when a genuine article bearing a true mark is sold." NEC Elecs., 810 F.2d at 1509 (sale of genuine trademarked product by seller unauthorized to sell not a violation of Lanham Act). Moreover, "[t]he `first sale' rule is not rendered inapplicable merely because consumers erroneously believe the reseller is affiliated with or authorized by the producer." Sebastian, 53 F.3d at 1076.
The first sale doctrine does not apply, however, when an alleged infringer sells trademarked goods that are materially different than those sold by the trademark owner. When the reseller's conduct goes beyond the mere resale of trademarked goods, such conduct may be sufficient to support a cause of action for infringement. Id. A materially different product is not genuine, and therefore its unauthorized sale constitutes trademark infringement. See Enesco Corp. v. Price/Costco Inc., 146 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that a non-conforming product is not genuine and "`... its distribution constitutes trademark infringement'" (quoting Warner-Lambert Co. v. Northside Dev. Corp., 86 F.3d 3, 6 (2d Cir.1996))). In this case, SoftMan's conduct goes beyond the mere resale of trademarked goods.
Clearly, not just any difference will cause consumer confusion. A material difference is one that consumers consider, on average, relevant to a decision about whether to purchase a product. See Martin's Herend Imps., Inc. v. Diamond & Gem Trading USA, Co., 112 F.3d 1296 (5th Cir.1997). In this case, the sale of software without access to customer support and technical services is a difference that an average consumer would consider relevant to a decision about whether to purchase a product.
According to both parties, the copies of Adobe software that SoftMan distributes are identical to lawful copies of these products. Adobe claims that SoftMan repackages and resells the Adobe software without "crucial registration elements such as a registration card." (Adobe Mot. at 13.) Adobe further argues that the copies lack customer support and technical support  information. Even if the software does contain these documents, Adobe claims, "customer service and technical support may be denied." (Id. at 17.) In short, Adobe contends that the crucial difference between the Adobe-packaged software and the SoftMan-packaged Adobe software is that the SoftMan version lacks the necessary registration capabilities. Adobe has submitted evidence that its investigators purchased Adobe products from SoftMan that lacked a registration and quick reference card. (Palma Decl. ¶ 12.) Without the ability to register a product, Adobe states that customers cannot receive technical support. Therefore, Adobe argues, customers who buy unbundled Adobe software from SoftMan may be deceived or confused as to whether they are entitled to the customer support and technical services normally associated with the purchase of software.
SoftMan disputes that unbundled collections of Adobe software are ineligible for support. According to SoftMan:
In fact, the registration process is individual to each program in the collection. Each program has an individual serial number. The number is the only thing required to register a program and become eligible for customer support. A consumer who purchases a collection can register the programs contained therein by listing each serial number on a registration card or by going on-line and entering each serial number at the designated web site. A consumer who purchases a single program from SoftMan can similarly register that program by entering the serial number contained on each disk in the designated web site.
(SoftMan Suppl. Brief at 13-14.)
The Court finds that customer support and technical services are intertwined functions that may be required to insure a "genuine" Adobe product. If the software sold by SoftMan lacked the capacity for registration, then the copies sold by SoftMan would not be "genuine" insofar as they failed to include access to Adobe's technical support and customer service. In such a case, when the altered products bear Adobe's name and are in fact actual Adobe-manufactured software, the Court concludes that these end-products, reshrinkwrapped by SoftMan, could create customer confusion and could infringe Adobe's trademarks.
There are a number of factual disputes to be resolved, however, before the question of whether a material difference exists between SoftMan's repackaged Adobe software and Adobe's standard software. Whether consumers in fact can and do access Adobe customer support when they buy Adobe software from SoftMan is disputed. At oral argument, Adobe's counsel seemed to indicate that customer service and support might be unavailable to consumers who purchased Adobe software from SoftMan, but that such decisions were made on an ad hoc basis. Adobe does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim because questions of fact predominate as to the central issue. In a situation where each party makes opposing representations as to a disputed fact going directly to Adobe's likelihood of success on the merits, the Court will assign no weight to this factor.
2. Irreparable Injury
The Court will not presume irreparable injury to Adobe in this case because Adobe fails to make a showing of likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim. Brookfield, 174 at 1066. For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that preliminary injunctive relief is not necessary in this case to prevent to irreparable injury in the form of harm to Adobe's trademark.21
 3. Public Policy
The Ninth Circuit has held that public policy favors granting an injunction when an infringing product is likely to cause consumer confusion. See Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, 611 F.2d 296, 300-02 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1227, 103 S.Ct. 1234, 75 L.Ed.2d 468 (1983). As discussed above, the Court does not find that Adobe has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the question of consumer confusion. Therefore, public policy considerations do not weigh in favor of granting Adobe's request for a preliminary injunction.
IV. Conclusion
As set forth above, the Court finds that Adobe has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark or copyright claims. The Court finds that Adobe has not demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, particularly in light of Adobe's own admissions that it has known about SoftMan's activities since 1997. The Court denies Adobe's application for a preliminary injunction. The Court hereby ORDERS that the preliminary injunction entered by this Court on September 10, 2001 be VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.


FootNotes 
1. SoftMan agrees that, at one point, it sold Adobe Educational software, but disputes that it has done so within the past year. (SoftMan Opp. at 6.)

2. "Collections" are sets of individual Adobe products, such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator on separate CD's, that are sold together in a larger Adobe Retail Box. These Collections are offered by Adobe at a discount from the individual retail products comprising the Collection. (Adobe Mot. at 3.) "An example of an Adobe Collection is the Adobe Publishing Collection, comprised of Adobe PageMaker, Acrobat, Photoshop and Illustrator, for $999. Separately, these products retails as follows: Pagemaker — $499, Acrobat — $249, Photoshop — $609 and Illustrator — $399." (Id.)

3. Specific agreements include the Adobe Authorized Reseller Agreement (for distribution of full Retail versions of Adobe software), the Adobe Off-Campus Educational Reseller Agreement ("OCRA") for distribution of Educational software, and the Original Equipment Manufacturer Agreements ("OEM") (for distribution of Adobe software coupled to hardware such as a scanner). (Snyder Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 2; Williams Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.)

4. Title 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) provides that the owner of a copyright has "the exclusive rights ... to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." 17 U.S.C. § 106(3).

5. These agreements are signed licenses between Adobe and the named distributor. Adobe's general distribution agreement provides in part: "Distributor acknowledges that the Software Products are to be licensed to End Users in accordance with the terms and conditions of the current End User License Agreement.... Distributor shall distribute the Software Products solely in the form and packaging in which they were obtained from Adobe." (Soriano Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 7.) Adobe's Reseller Agreement states that: "Reseller acknowledges that the structure and organization of the Software is proprietary to Adobe and that Adobe retains exclusive ownership of the Software and the Trademarks." (Navarro Suppl. Decl., at p. 3, ¶ 9.)
Most computer program and database product copies are distributed with standard form terms in a document characterized as a "license". The standard terms purport, among other things: to specify permitted uses of a copy, e.g., consumer or personal versus commercial; to prohibit certain uses of a computer program copy, e.g., reverse engineering of the computer program code; to forbid any use that is not expressly authorized, e.g., commercial processing of third party data or business records; and to bar transfer of a copy and the "license" to another person. (Rice Decl. ¶ 5.)

6. The EULA states in part: "The receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement (EULA) and any other terms and conditions upon which [the end user] legally purchased a license to the Software." (Adobe EULA ¶ 4, attached to Palma Decl., Ex. 1.) Adobe's EULA permits an end user, subject to certain restrictions, to transfer the software, media, and documentation to another end user. The restrictions relating to an end user's ability to transfer include that the EULA must also be transferred and that "[t]he Software and all other software or hardware bundled or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and prior verison, and all copies of font software converted into other formats." (Id.)

7. The parties have made much of the change to Adobe's EULA that occurred in April 2000. The Court finds that, under the current language of the EULA, Adobe's clear intent is to prohibit the unbundling activity. Therefore, assuming arguendo that the prior agreement did not prohibit the conduct at issue, the current EULA does clearly state that the "unbundling activities" are barred. (See Maier Decl. ¶ 3.)

8. "From Adobe's distributors through the end users, every party along the way receives only a license. Since no party can transfer more rights than it acquired, it follows that there was no "first sale" in the transfer to SoftMan, and SoftMan's unbundling of Adobe software is copyright infringement as a matter of law." (Adobe Suppl. Brief at 5.)

9. See, e.g., Mark A. Lemley, Intellectual Property and Shrinkwrap Licenses, 68 S. Cal. L.Rev. 1239 (1995) ("Software vendors are attempting en masse to `opt out' of intellectual property law by drafting license provisions that compel their customers to adhere to more restrictive provisions than copyright law would require.").

10. The court in Step-Saver explained: "When these form licenses were first developed for software, it was, in large part, to avoid the federal copyright law first sale doctrine.... Under this doctrine, one could purchase a copy of a computer program, and then lease it or lend it to another without infringing the copyright on the program.... Consumers, instead of purchasing their own copy of the program, would simply rent a copy of the program, and duplicate it.... [S]oftware producers wanted to sue the companies that were renting the copies of the program to individual consumers, rather than the individual consumers. The first sale doctrine, though, stood as a substantial barrier to successful suit against these software rental companies, even under a theory of contributory infringement. By characterizing the original transaction between the software producer and the software rental company as a license, rather than a sale, and by making the license personal and non-transferable, software producers hoped to avoid the reach of the first sale doctrine and to establish a basis in state contract law for suing the software rental companies directly. Questions remained, however, as to whether the use of state contract law to avoid the first sale doctrine would be preempted either by the federal copyright statute (statutory preemption) or by the exclusive constitutional grant of authority over copyright issues to the federal government (constitutional preemption). [Citations.] Congress recognized the problem, and, in 1990, amended the first sale doctrine as it applies to computer programs and phonorecords. [Citations.] As amended, the first sale doctrine permits only non-profit libraries and educational institutions to lend or lease copies of software and phonorecords. [citations.] (Under the amended statute, a purchaser of a copy of a copyrighted computer program may still sell his copy to another without the consent of the copyright holder.)." 939 F.2d at 96, n. 7.

11. "Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied." 17 U.S.C. § 202.

12. The term "shrinkwrap license" refers to the fact that the license begins when the purchaser reads its terms and tears open the transparent plastic wrapping, or "shrinkwrap," that encloses the software product. "Although early shrinkwrap licenses often were visible prior to purchase, and could be read before the purchaser tore open the software's wrapping, more recent variants place the license within the software's packaging or on the disk itself." Stephen P. Tarolli, The Future of Information Commerce under Contemporary Contract and Copyright Principles, 46 Am. U.L.Rev. 1639, 1647-48 (1997) (footnote omitted); see also ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447, 1450 (7th Cir.1996) ("The `shrinkwrap license' gets its name from the fact that retail software packages are covered in plastic or cellophane `shrinkwrap' ... vendors ... have written licenses that become effective as soon as the customer tears the wrapping from the package. Vendors prefer `end user license' ...").

13. "In purchasing Adobe software from authorized distributors, I always understood that SoftMan was obtaining title to the particular copies it purchased.... SoftMan paid fair value for the product and assumes the risk of loss or damage upon receipt. SoftMan also assumed the risk of loss if it was unable to resell the software." (Dracup Decl. ¶ 8.)

14. SoftMan points to the language of Adobe's distribution agreements, which includes sale terms and states that the distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage of the product. (Soriano Decl., Ex. 1 at 5.7-5.14.) Therefore, SoftMan argues, Adobe transfers title in the software to its distributors subject to a license restricting the distributor's rights and the manner in which the distributor may sell the software. In addition, SoftMan argues that even if title does not pass to the distributors, the distributors may still transfer title in individual copies subject to the terms of the EULA. A consumer may obtain good title from a distributor who has not perfected title. Unif. Comm.Code § 2-403(2).

15. The enforceability of use restrictions and transfer prohibitions set forth in standard form, non-negotiated, computer program copy "licenses" has been the subject of substantial academic and other controversy. (Rice Decl. ¶ 28.)

16. "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series." 17 U.S.C. § 201(c).

17. The Court held: "The publishers are not sheltered by § 201(c) ... because the databases reproduce and distribute articles standing alone and not in context, not `as part of that particular collective work' to which the author contributed, `as part of ... any revision' thereof, or `as part of ... any later collective work in the same series.' Both the print publishers and the electronic publishers, we rule, have infringed the copyrights of the freelance authors." Tasini, ___ U.S. at ____ _ ___, 121 S.Ct. at 2384-85.

18. Adobe alleges that SoftMan grossed $700,000 from the sale of Adobe products between October 2000 and May 2001. (Van Voorhis Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 7.)

19. Scholars have suggested that Congress contemplated that parties might attempt to contract out of a first sale right. "Congress was explicit in the context of section 109(a) that it intended for vendors who `contract around' the first sale doctrine to be limited to contract remedies. The approach of shrinkwrap licenses — to attempt to extend vendor rights by contract while retaining the panoply of copyright remedies — was explicitly disavowed by the Committee Note." Mark A. Lemley, Intellectual Property and Shrinkwrap Licenses, 68 S. Cal. L.Rev. 1239, 1283 (1995) (citing H.R. Rep. 94-1476 (1976) (providing that the parties may contract around the first sale doctrine in 17 U.S.C. 109(a), but limiting the copyright owner to contract rather than copyright remedies if they do so)).

20. Lemley, Intellectual Property, at 1283.

21. Adobe also brings claims for Unfair Competition under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and Unfair Competition under California Business & Professional Codes Section 17200 et seq. Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits the use of any false designation of origin which is likely to cause confusion as to the origin of the goods. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). Section 43(a) protects qualifying registered trademarks. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992). Adobe asserts that by unbundling Collections software and then reshrinkwrapping them and distributing them as individual pieces of Retail software, SoftMan is using Adobe's trademarks in a manner calculated to mislead and to deceive consumers concerning the affiliation, connection, or association of SoftMan with the true owner of the Adobe trademarks. For the reasons stated above relating to the existence of factual disputes on the question of consumer confusion (questions that preclude a finding that Adobe has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim), the Court finds that Adobe has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable injury on these additional claims. The Court denies Adobe's request for preliminary injunctive relief on these additional grounds.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
