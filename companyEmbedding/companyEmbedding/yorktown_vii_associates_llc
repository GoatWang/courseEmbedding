This Amendment No. 2 amends the Schedule 13D with respect to the Common Stock of Hallador
Energy Company, a Colorado corporation formerly known as Hallador Petroleum Company (the Company), previously filed by Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (Yorktown), with the SEC on

Schedule 13D.   


Item 5.
Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  Subparagraphs a and c of Item 5 in the
Schedule 13D are amended and restated in their entirety by the following:  (a) As of August 24, 2015, Yorktown, the General Partner

(c) On August 19, 2015, Yorktown distributed in-kind, on a pro rata basis and for no additional consideration, in accordance with its
limited partnership agreement, an aggregate of 700,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, to its limited and general partners (the Distribution). Upon the consummation of the Distribution by Yorktown, the General Partner distributed
in-kind, on a pro rata basis and for no additional consideration, in accordance with its limited partnership agreement, all 10,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company received in the Distribution to its limited and general partners (the
Subsequent Distribution). Upon the consummation of the Subsequent Distribution by the General Partner, the LLC distributed in-kind, on a pro rata basis and for no additional consideration, in accordance with its operating agreement, all
54 shares of Common Stock of the Company received in the Subsequent Distribution to its members.
