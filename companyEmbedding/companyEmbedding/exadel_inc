WALNUT CREEK, Calif., May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Exadel Inc. (www.exadel.com), a leading provider of software technology services to power software business value, today unveiled its new global development services following the recent acquisition of three companies located in Europe and North America. Exadel's Innovation Sourcing strategy focuses on four elements: technology innovation, business intelligence and analytics, right-shoring strategies and non-traditional solution development. The company utilizes its highly educated Eastern European workforce, a leading-edge innovation center in Boulder, Colo., technology development centers in Europe and the growing demand for strategic software solutions that drive business value. 








"We've seen the future of technology innovation in the global enterprise, and it increasingly is dependent on data-driven business value and creative solutions," said Fima Katz, CEO of Exadel. "We understand that digital business transformation requires premium services accessible around the world, and our global presence now allows us to utilize highly specialized resources no matter the project, and more importantly, no matter the scale of the project or location." 
During the past year Exadel acquired three companies, each elevating the Exadel advantage, beginning with a Software Innovation Center in Boulder, Colo., business intelligence and analytics in Poland, and an award-winning, custom software engineering firm in Europe. The growth strategy allows the company not only to provide its core services at scale, but also hone its focus on blending business practices, strategy and problem solving with technology solutions to provide comprehensive Innovation Sourcing services for the global enterprise.
Lisa Calkins, chief strategy officer at Exadel, is driving this strategic growth and development evolution. "The real-world challenges and opportunities that technology is providing businesses today are not just realized with more investment in development resources.  We need to approach these challenges differently," she said. "It may take brainstorming 100-plus new business ideas to come up with a handful of executive investment opportunities with new technologies. They may include moving into an adjacent market, experimenting with new business models or launching new products or services. It's really about taking an expert-generalist approach to solving challenges in unique ways that drive business. From there, it's about execution. These are the cornerstones of our strategy."
Calkins is using Exadel's physical and cognitive resources to pursue growth in leading-edge technologies, such as enterprise IoT, the healthcare and financial services sectors, blockchain, augmented reality (AR), emotional intelligence, wearables, sensors and more. These technologies add business value to Exadel's core services in enterprise application development, mobile development and product development.
Supporting the launch of its new set of capabilities, Exadel also facilitated a re-branding effort and full website re-launch, designed to serve its global customer base with translations coming in German, Polish, and more.
About ExadelExadel Inc. represents a new breed of innovation sourcing company that provides software solutions that drive innovation and mission-critical business value. With operations in the U.S. and Europe, leading global enterprises turn to Exadel to transform business objectives into technical strategy – helping them to win and differentiate in increasingly competitive markets.

      Exadel​.org for Open Source Projects       
Posted by Charles Cowens on March 8, 2010 		
		under Company, Products
 Edit 

The prod­uct di­rec­tion for Exadel is to move more and more to­wards open source. From the be­gin­ning, our Exadel Flamingo prod­uct has al­ways been open source in the sense of pub­lish­ing the source code along with the bi­na­ries in re­leases. With Exadel JavaFX Plug-In for Eclipse, we are now mov­ing fur­ther to a full open source model that in­cludes open­ing up the de­vel­op­ment process and not just the code for each re­lease.
To make the process of mov­ing prod­ucts to full open source eas­ier, we’ve cre­ated a dot-org ver­sion of our Web site to host these projects:

      Exadel Just Got a Mobile Merit Award for Appery​.io       
Posted by Charles Cowens on September 5, 2013 		
		under Announcements
 Edit 


We won! Mobile Merit Awards rec­og­nizes ex­cel­lence achieved in the global mo­bile in­dus­try each year. This year Exadel was rec­og­nized as the win­ner in the Mobile Services/​Enterprise Product or Service cat­e­gory for our Appery​.io mo­bile app plat­form.
For a while, we’ve noted the grow­ing gap as the de­mand for mo­bile in­no­va­tion in the en­ter­prise out­strips the ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ca­pac­ity of IT or­ga­ni­za­tions. Our Appery​.io mo­bile app plat­form is just one ex­am­ple of how we are clos­ing this gap. We also of­fer ser­vices to help or­ga­ni­za­tions use Appery​.io and, of course, a full gamut of en­ter­prise soft­ware de­vel­op­ment ser­vices in ad­di­tion to Appery.io-specific ser­vices.
Congratulation to our hard-work­ing global prod­uct de­vel­op­ment team!
