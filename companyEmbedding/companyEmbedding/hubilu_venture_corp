We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities being
registered pursuant to this registration statement on behalf of the Selling
Security Holders.


The real estate advisory and consulting services industry is highly competitive.
We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and
other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger
organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of
large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as real estate
brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, consultants as well as many
companies that have greater financial and other resources than us.

The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of
service, the quality of work product the clients desire and price. Our ability
to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality services
depends primarily on the level of training of our future staff, the utilization
of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver our services in an
effective and timely manner. We believe we will compete effectively in all of
these areas.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical,
managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more
effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than
we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect
our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to
obtain more experienced employees than we can.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on March
2, 2015. On March 4, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Correction to the
Certificate of Incorporation to correct our name to Hubilu Venture Corporation
from Hubilu Venture Corp. On March 5, 2015, our incorporator adopted


 our bylaws
and appointed our sole director. We were formed to provide consulting and
advisory services to real estate professionals and investors to assist them in
finding properties and evaluating them for purchase or leasing. We are not a
real estate brokerage firm and do not engage in real estate brokerage
activities. Our services are limited to research and analysis of real estate
properties and advising clients on the best use of their real estate assets.
---

We are a development stage enterprise that commenced operations in March 2015,
which, until June 2015, has been limited to organizational and business
development activities. We are real estate advisory and consulting company that
assists real estate investor professionals, as well as established companies,
with advisory and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis
and acquisition opportunities to them. Our mission is to assist investors and
professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the
evaluation of properties prior to them committing capital for the purchase or
the leasing of real estate properties. We intend to focus our initial marketing
efforts in the commercial markets; however, we will also look at residential and
income producing markets. We intend to use the Internet as well as the services
of independent sales consultants to market our services to investors and
professionals in Southern California with our initial efforts focused in Beverly
Hills and Los Angeles. We have had limited operations and have limited financial
resources. Our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements
(the “Report”) that “the Company’s lack of business operations and early losses
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” Our
operations from March 2015 to June 2015 have been devoted primarily to start-up,
development and operational activities, which include:

1. Formation of the Company;

2. Development of our business plan;

3. Evaluating various target real estate professionals and investors to market
   our services;

4. Research on marketing channels/strategies for our services;

5. Secured our website domain www.hubilu.com and beginning the development of
   our initial online website; and

6. Research on services and the pricing of our services.

Commencing in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus
Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property. We are
also in negotiations with Camden Realty Group, a real estate brokerage firm, to
provide consulting services to it and to have it provide brokerage services to
our clients.

We intend to provide services to target investors and professionals with the
mission to assist them in investment and property evaluation strategies and
provide hands-on support to reduce evaluation time and resources and increase
the speed for them to determine whether to proceed with a real estate lease or
investment. Besides general property evaluation services, we intend to offer
services to assist the principals with property development ideas and investment
structure.

Our goal is to assist investors by providing them with the property
opportunities, analysis and guidance to enhance their ability to purchase or
lease real estate. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer
brokerage services. We intend to initially target businesses in Southern
California.

9777 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 804, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 and our telephone number
