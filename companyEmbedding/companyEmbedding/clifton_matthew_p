  Top Businesses         Sidi Sylvain MD       Valley Dental       OrthoTexas       Mulhall Family Chiropractic       CPR Training Denver    About UsHealth is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word complete. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. Classification systems such as the WHO Family of International Classifications, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.

(PRN) Matthew P. Clifton Named Holly Corporation Chairman


PRNewswire-FirstCall


        Published 11:10 am, Monday, April 9, 2007
    



































































DALLAS, April 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Holly Corporation (NYSE: HOC) ("Holly") today announced that its Board of Directors has elected Matthew P. Clifton, who has served as Holly's Chief Executive Officer since the beginning of 2006, to the additional position of Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Clifton has been employed by Holly for over twenty-five years. He has served as Holly's Chief Executive Officer since January 2006. He has been a director of Holly since 1995 and was President of the Company from 1995 through 2005. He previously held positions as Holly's Vice President of economics, engineering and legal affairs from 1988 to 1991 and Holly's Senior Vice President from 1991 to 1995. Mr. Clifton also serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer for Holly Energy Partners, L.P., a limited partnership in which Holly has a 45% interest (including the general partner interest), which began its operations in July 2004.
In the position of Chairman of the Board, Mr. Clifton replaces Lamar Norsworthy, who is no longer able to serve because of disability following an illness that began in October 2006. Mr. Norsworthy first became a member of Holly's Board in 1968 and served as Holly's chief executive officer from 1971 through the end of 2005. He had held the position of Chairman of the Board from 1977 until Mr. Clifton's election as Chairman in early April.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New Jersey:













Does Matthew P Martinique carry a valid contracting license?



The state of New Jersey does not offer a contractor license designation. State law does require contractors to register annually with the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. This registration must be prominently displayed on all of the contractors commercial vehicles, places of business, and business related documents, contracts, and correspondence. The registration number must begin with the letters HIC reg.# 
Matthew P Martinique currently holds license 21AI02022700 (Architecture), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Matthew P Martinique



New Jersey state law requires all contractors to maintain an active general liability policy. It is always a good idea to hire contractors with both general liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. Request copies of both insurance certificates before any work begins.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in New Jersey, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
