Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses. Total returns shown take into account these fees and expenses.Growth of a $10,000 Investment from 06/30/07 to 06/30/17 06/0706/0906/1106/1306/1506/17Growth Chart$10000$10196$13347$16621$18738$20550SourceSource: Deutsche Asset Management.

Annualized dividend yield is the latest monthly dividend shown as an annualized percentage of net asset value and market price as of month-end. Annualized dividend yield simply measures the level of dividends and is not a complete measure of performance.  Annualized dividend yield does not include any non-income items, such as offering proceeds or borrowings.closeCredit QualityAAA3 %AA23 %A34 %BBB18 %BB7 %B1 %Not Rated14 %    Credit Quality Information...Credit quality represents the higher rating of either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation and is their opinion as to the quality of the securities they rate. Credit quality does not remove market risk and is subject to change.Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.Effective duration is the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates.closeManagement TeamRebecca L.

    R-002918.8 (4/17)Important Objectives and Risk InformationThe fund seeks a high level of current income exempt from federal income tax. The fund invests at least 50% of its assets in investment-grade municipal securities or unrated municipal securities of comparable quality, and may invest up to 50% of its assets in high-yield municipal securities that are below investment grade. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.

Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses. Total returns shown take into account these fees and expenses.Growth of a $10,000 Investment from 06/30/07 to 06/30/17 06/0706/0906/1106/1306/1506/17Growth Chart$10000$9973$14792$17502$19570$21663SourceSource: Deutsche Asset Management.

Annualized dividend yield does not include any non-income items, such as offering proceeds or borrowings.closeCredit QualityAAA3 %BBB20 %BB57 %B19 %CCC1 %  Credit Quality Information...Credit quality represents the higher rating of either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation and is their opinion as to the quality of the securities they rate.

    R-002919.8 (4/17)Important Objectives and Risk InformationScheduled Liquidation date: No later than 12/31/18. The fund seeks to provide high current income by investing its assets in a combination of (a) lower-rated, corporate fixed-income securities; (b) fixed-income securities of emerging markets and other foreign issuers; and (c) fixed-income securities of the US government and its agencies and instrumentalities, and mortgage-backed issuers. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality ("junk bonds") and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.
