All other terms of the Debt Facilities, as amended by the First Amendment, remain substantially similar in all material respects to those in the Debt Facilities prior to giving effect to the First Amendment. On July 19, 2017, $50 million was drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, with such funds used in connection with financing the acquisition of the Seaways Hatteras and the Seaways Montauk as described herein, and on July 24, 2017 $50 million was drawn under the Amended Term Loan.

      Team




Names Lois Zabrocky Chief Executive Officer and Jeffrey Pribor Chief 
      Financial Officer


Announces International Seaways Board of Directors






November 09, 2016 07:01 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE:OSG) (the “Company” or “OSG”), as 
      previously announced, is pursuing a spin-off of its international 
      business and announced today key executive appointments for what will be 
      an industry-leading international crude and product tanker company, 
      International Seaways, Inc., once the transaction is complete.
    


      Following the spin-off, Lois K. Zabrocky will become president and chief 
      executive officer of International Seaways, while Jeffrey D. Pribor will 
      join International Seaways as chief financial officer. Mr. Pribor will 
      report to Ms. Zabrocky.
    

      “Lois is a talented executive who has been with OSG almost 25 years,” 
      said Captain Ian T. Blackley, OSG’s president and CEO. “I have worked 
      closely with Lois for many years, and I am confident in her ability to 
      lead International Seaways forward. As President of OSG’s International 
      Flag Strategic Business Unit, Lois has had P&L responsibility and played 
      a major part in its strategic decision making. We are confident that she 
      is the ideal executive to lead International Seaways as it embarks on an 
      exciting new chapter.”
    

      “It is an honor and privilege to lead International Seaways as it begins 
      its journey as an independent public company,” said Zabrocky. “I am 
      delighted to be part of such an incredible team with a long history of 
      providing safe, efficient and reliable transportation to our customers. 
      With this as our platform, we are well positioned for continued success 
      and I am committed to working with our Board and employees to maximize 
      revenue, drive down costs and capture growth opportunities as we provide 
      the highest quality service to our customers and deliver value for our 
      shareholders.”
    

      Zabrocky continued, “We are pleased to welcome Jeff as the chief 
      financial officer of International Seaways. Jeff’s extensive operational 
      and financial management experience as CFO for a leading shipping 
      company coupled with his wealth of maritime banking experience will 
      complement and enhance our management strengths and capabilities. We are 
      fortunate to have such a seasoned executive in this important role as we 
      continue to drive International Seaways’ global business.”
    

      As chief financial officer of International Seaways, Inc., Mr. Pribor 
      will be responsible for directing and supervising all of the financial 
      functions of International Seaways. This includes accounting, financial 
      planning and analysis, tax, treasury and investor relations.
    

      “This is an exciting time to be joining International Seaways, a 
      financially strong company with both a rich history and a compelling 
      future,” Pribor said. “I look forward to working with Lois and the 
      entire International Seaways team to advance the company’s strategy and 
      drive shareholder value.”
    

      Completing the senior leadership team of International Seaways is James 
      D. Small III who will become chief administrative officer, secretary and 
      general counsel following the spin-off, and reporting to Ms. Zabrocky. 
      Mr. Small joined OSG in March 2015 after almost 20 years with Cleary 
      Gottlieb advising on transactional and governance matters.
    

      “James has provided invaluable counsel to the organization and has been 
      a driving force behind numerous corporate initiatives at OSG,” said 
      Zabrocky. “He will be a critical part in helping to drive the future 
      success of International Seaways.”
    

      Upon separation, International Seaways will own and operate one of the 
      largest fleets of international crude and product tankers worldwide. At 
      September 30, 2016, International Seaways owned or operated a fleet of 
      55 vessels with a combined capacity of approximately 6.5 million 
      deadweight tons and 864,800 cubic meters. International Seaways’ 
      operating fleet comprises one ULCC, eight VLCCs, eight Aframaxes/LR2s, 
      12 Panamaxes/LR1s and 20 MR tankers. Through joint venture partnerships, 
      International Seaways has ownership interests in four liquefied natural 
      gas carriers and two floating storage and offloading service vessels.

International Seaways Begins Operating as an Independent, Publicly 
      Traded Company






December 01, 2016 08:16 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--International Seaways, Inc. (NYSE:INSW) (the “Company” or “INSW”) 
      announced today it has completed the spin-off from its former parent 
      company, Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., and has begun operating as an 
      independent, publicly traded company. Starting December 1, 2016, the new 
      International Seaways will begin “regular-way” trading on the New York 
      Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “INSW”.
    


      “This is a historic day for International Seaways, its employees and its 
      shareholders,” said Lois K. Zabrocky, INSW’s President and CEO. “The 
      completion of the separation simplifies our operating structure, 
      enhances our strategic focus and creates a more distinct investment 
      profile, which will allow us to attract a broader base of shareholders. 
      We are launching at a favorable time in the market cycle with a strong 
      financial position that we believe will provide us with multiple 
      opportunities to create value for our shareholders,” Zabrocky concluded.
    

      At 5:00 p.m. on Nov. 30, 2016, 100 percent of the shares of 
      International Seaways were distributed to OSG shareholders and 
      warrantholders. OSG shareholders received 0.3333 shares of International 
      Seaways common stock for every one share of OSG common stock held at 
      5:00 p.m. on November 18, 2016, the record date for the spin-off.
    

      For each OSG warrant held on the record date, OSG warrantholders 
      received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every one share of OSG 
      common stock they would have received if they exercised those warrants 
      immediately prior to the distribution date (or approximately 0.06332 
      INSW shares per warrant). OSG shareholders and warrantholders received 
      cash in lieu of any fractional shares.
    

      In connection with the listing of its shares of common stock on the 
      NYSE, President and CEO Lois K. Zabrocky along with members of the 
      Company will ring The NYSE Closing Bell on Friday, December 2, 2016. The

Business Wire
