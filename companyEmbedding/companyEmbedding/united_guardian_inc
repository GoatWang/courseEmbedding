P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Company Information:

				United-Guardian Inc., is located at Hauppauge, NY and is a diversified company that conducts research, product development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceuticals, cosmetic ingredients, health care products, medical devices, and proprietary industrial products.
At the present time United is actively marketing only 15-20 of its products. It has many other products that have been developed, or are in various stages of development. The company believes that many of these products have excellent market potential, but require outside marketing assistance. United is currently seeking partners to either market some of its products, or to enter into joint ventures with United to perform this function. United is also seeking companies interested in licensing, or purchasing outright, those products that have excellent market potential but which do not fit into United's current emphasis on the cosmetic and personal care field.

					Full Description



United-Guardian, Inc., incorporated on April 22, 1987, manufactures and markets cosmetic ingredients, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, medical lubricants, healthcare products and specialty industrial products. The Company also conducts research and product development, primarily related to the development of cosmetic and personal care products. The Company's research and development department also modifies, refines and expands the uses for existing products. Its products are separated into approximately four distinct product categories, such as personal care products (including cosmetic ingredients), pharmaceuticals, medical products and industrial products.The Company's personal care products are marketed globally by approximately six marketing partners. The products are sold directly to marketing partners, which in turn resell those products to its customers for use in the manufacture or compounding of the customers' personal care and cosmetic products. Its non-pharmaceutical medical products (medical products) and the specialty industrial products are sold directly by the Company to the end users or to contract manufacturers utilized by the end users. Its pharmaceutical products are marketed by direct advertising, mailings, and trade exhibitions, and are sold to end users primarily through drug wholesalers, which purchase the Company's products outright for resale to their customers. The Company also sells pharmaceutical products directly to hospitals and pharmacies.Personal CareThe Company's Personal Care products include LUBRAJEL, a line of water-based moisturizing and lubricating gel formulations that are used as ingredients in personal care (primarily cosmetic/skincare) products. In the personal care industry, they are used primarily as moisturizers and as bases for other cosmetic ingredients, and can be found as an ingredient in skin creams, moisturizers, makeup and body lotions. LUBRAJEL PF is a preservative-free form of LUBRAJEL. LUBRAJEL NATURAL is a natural form of LUBRAJEL for cosmetic use. They are based on natural polysaccharides, which contribute moisturization, emulsion stabilization and emolliency to personal care creams and lotions. KLENSOFT is a surfactant that can be used in shampoos, shower gels, makeup removers and other cosmetic formulations. LUBRAJEL II XD is a version of LUBRAJEL. UNITWIX is a cosmetic additive used as a thickener for oils and oil-based liquids. LUBRASIL is a special form of LUBRAJEL in which silicone oil is combined into a LUBRAJEL base by micro-emulsification, thereby maintaining clarity similar to the other LUBRAJEL products.The Company's ORCHID COMPLEX is a base for skin creams, lotions, cleansers, and other cosmetics. ORCHID COMPLEX is an extract of fresh orchids modified by stabilizers and preservatives, and is characterized by its lubricity, spreadability, light feel and emolliency. Because of its alcohol solubility, it can also be used in fragrance products, such as perfumes and toiletries. Its emolliency makes it an additive to shampoos, bath products and facial cleansers. It is also an emollient for sunscreens, vitamin creams, toners and skin serums.

				United-Guardian, Inc. (UG) - Description of business
			









(a)    General Development of Business United-Guardian,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is a  Delaware  corporation  that conducts research, product development,  manufacturing and marketing of cosmetic ingredients, personal and health care products,  pharmaceuticals,  and specialty industrial   products.  The Company  also distributes  an extensive line of fine organic chemicals,  research  chemicals,  test solutions,  indicators,  dyes and reagents  through  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Eastern  Chemical  Corporation ("Eastern"). The Company's predecessor,  United International Research Corp. (name later changed to United International Research, Inc.), was founded and incorporated in New York in 1942 by Dr.  Alfred R.  Globus,  the  Company's  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer. On February 10, 1982, a merger took place between the Company and Guardian Chemical Corp.  ("GCC"),  an affiliate of the Company,  whereby GCC was merged into the Company and the name was changed to United-Guardian, Inc. On September  14, 1987,  United-Guardian,  Inc. (New York) was merged with and into United-Guardian,  Inc., a newly incorporated Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company. The Company operates in two business segments: (1) The Guardian  Laboratories  Division  ("Guardian")  conducts  research, product  development,  manufacturing  and  marketing  of  cosmetic  ingredients,personal and health care  products,  pharmaceuticals,  and specialty  industrial products.  The  Research  and  Development  Department  of  Guardian  engages in research and development in the fields of cosmetics,  health care products,  and specialty  industrial  chemical  products,  for the  purpose of  developing  new products,  and refining  existing  products that will be marketed or licensed by Guardian.  Many of the  products  manufactured  by  Guardian,  particularly  its LUBRAJEL(R)  line of  products,  are  marketed  worldwide  through a network  of distributors, and are currently used by many of the major multinational cosmetic companies. Guardian  presently  has a broad  range  of  products,  some of  which  are currently marketed,  some of which are marketable but are not currently marketed by the Company,  and some of which are still in the developmental  stage. Of the products being actively marketed, the two largest product lines are the LUBRAJEL line of cosmetic  ingredients,  which  accounted  for  approximately  68% of the Company's  sales in 2005,  and its  RENACIDIN(R)  IRRIGATION,  a  pharmaceutical product that accounted for approximately 17% of the Company's sales in 2005. The Company actively seeks other companies as potential  marketers for its products, particularly for those products that are not yet being actively  marketed by the Company. (2) Eastern is a distributor of fine organic chemicals, research chemicals, intermediates,  reagents,  indicators,  dyes and stains. It has been in business for over 50 years,  the last 30 or so as a part of the  Company.  It  carries an extensive line of products  which it sells  throughout the United States as well as overseas.  Eastern's  products are primarily sold either to distributors  for resale in smaller  quantities or as intermediates  and raw materials for further chemical  processing.  Sales quantities range from a few hundred grams to over a thousand  kilos  per  shipment.   Although   Eastern  carries  out  no  chemical manufacturing,  it does contract with several custom chemical  manufacturers and also will package to order for those customers that require it. Paragon Organic Chemicals, Inc. ("Paragon") is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that  functions as  a purchasing  arm for Eastern.  It has no assets or sales of its own.(b)  Narrative Description of Business Guardian Laboratories Division Guardian  conducts  research,   product   development,   manufacturing  and marketing  of many  different  cosmetic  ingredients,  personal  and health care products,  pharmaceuticals,  and specialty industrial products, all of which are developed by the Company, and many of which have unique properties. The products manufactured by Guardian are marketed through marketing partners,  distributors, direct  advertising,  mailings,  and trade exhibitions.  Guardian's  proprietary cosmetic  ingredients are sold through  marketing  partners and distributors and are  incorporated  into  products  marketed  by many of the major  international cosmetic   companies.   Many  of  Guardian's   products  are  marketed   through collaborative  agreements with larger companies. The pharmaceutical products are sold to end users  primarily  through  drug  wholesalers.  These  sales  include indirect sales to the Veteran's  Administration  and other government  agencies. There are also a small number of direct sales to hospitals and pharmacies. During 2005, Guardian's sales accounted for approximately 91% of Company's total product sales. Guardian's  products are sold under  trademarks or trade names owned by the Company. The marks for the most important products,  LUBRAJEL and RENACIDIN, are registered as trademarks  in the United States Patent and Trademark  Office.  In 2005 sales from these two  product  lines  accounted  for  approximately  93% of Guardian's sales, and 85% of the sales of the Company as a whole.PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS: ------------------ LUBRAJEL LUBRAJEL is a line of nondrying  water-based  moisturizing  and lubricating gels that have applications in the cosmetic industry  primarily as a moisturizer and as a base for other cosmetic products, and in the medical field primarily as a lubricant.  In the cosmetic  industry it is used primarily as a stable gel for application  around the eyes and on the face and as an ingredient in skin creams and  moisturizers,   makeup,  body  lotions,  hair  preparations,   salves,  and ointments.  As a medical lubricant it has been used on catheters,  prelubricated enema tips, and thermometers. The most important product in the LUBRAJEL line in 2005 was once again  LUBRAJEL  CG, the  original  form of  LUBRAJEL;  the second largest revenue producer in the Lubrajel line was LUBRAJEL MS. LUBRAJEL  RR and RC are  special  grades  of  LUBRAJEL  that can  withstand sterilization  by gamma  radiation,  which is one of the  methods of  terminally sterilizing  medical and hospital  products.  On April 11, 1995, the Company was granted a U.S. patent for this unique form of LUBRAJEL.  In September,  1994 the Company entered into a marketing  agreement with Avail Medical (formerly Horizon Medical),  a California  company engaged in the development and manufacturing of products and services to the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. Avail has been actively  marketing LUBRAJEL RC since January,  1996.  Lubrajel RR, the original  radiation  resistant  form of  Lubrajel,  is sold  to  medical  device manufacturers  primarily for use in  lubricating  urethral  catheters. The Company  believes  that its ability to increase  sales of its  LUBRAJEL products  will depend on (a) the ability of its marketing  partners,  especially ISP Technologies Inc. ("ISP"),  its largest  marketing  partner,  to continue to bring the  product to the  attention  of new  customers,  and (b) the  Company's success in bringing to market new forms of LUBRAJEL that will enable the product to be  used  in new  applications.  The  Company  is  currently  developing  new varieties of LUBRAJEL  for this  purpose.  In 2004 the Company  introduced a new LUBRAJEL  under the name  "LUBRAJEL  II XD", and intends to expand this new line further.  At the end of 2004 it also  introduced  a new  Lubrajel  line  using a different  preservative  system,  which the Company  believes  will  attract new customers  and  retain  existing   customers  that  might  require  a  different preservative system. It also intends to develop some new skin care products that will  have  enhanced  feel  and  additional   luricating   and/or   moisturizing properties.  The Company believes that there is still  significant  potential to expand  the  sales  of its  LUBRAJEL  line  of  products  through  both  product modifications and by geographic expansion, especially in developing markets such as mainland China, India, and eastern Europe. The Company  believes  that any sales  increases  in the  LUBRAJEL  line of products may be offset somewhat by sales of competitive  products.  Despite this competition,  the  Company  believes  that it will  still be able to expand  the market for its LUBRAJEL  product  line.  The Company  believes  that  LUBRAJEL'S reputation for quality and customer service,  as well as future additions to the LUBRAJEL  line,  will  enable  it to  continue  to  compete  effectively  in the marketplace. RENACIDIN RENACIDIN is a urological  prescription  drug,  approved in the U.S.  only, which  is  used   primarily  to  prevent  the   formation  of  and  to  dissolve calcifications in catheters  implanted in the urinary bladder. It is marketed as a ready to use sterile solution under the name "RENACIDIN IRRIGATION". RENACIDIN IRRIGATION  is also  approved  for use in  dissolving  certain  types of  kidney stones.  On October 9, 1990,  the Patent  Office  issued to the  Company  patent #4,962,208,   which  expires  on  October  9,  2007,   covering  the  method  of manufacturing RENACIDIN IRRIGATION.OTHER PRODUCTS: -------------- Other  significant  products that are manufactured and sold by Guardian but which did not individually  comprise more than 5% of the Company's sales in 2005 are as follows: CLORPACTIN(R)  WCS-90 is a  microbicidal  product used primarily in urology and surgery as an antiseptic  for treating a wide range of localized  infections in the urinary bladder, the peritoneum, the abdominal cavity, the eye, ear, nose and throat, and sinuses.  The product is a white powder that is mixed with water and used as a solution. It is a powerful  disinfectant,  fungicide,  deodorizer, bleach, and detergent. KLENSOFT(TM)  is a surfactant (a surface  active  agent,  such as a soap or detergent,  that can reduce the surface tension of a liquid and thus allow it to foam  or  penetrate  solids  or act as a  wetting  agent)  that  can be  used in shampoos,  shower gels, makeup removers,  and other cosmetic  formulations.  The primary  customer for  Klensoft for many years has been in Taiwan,  but over the past few years  there  have been new  customers  for the  product  in the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Korea. LUBRAJEL  PF  is a  preservative-free  form  of  LUBRAJEL  currently  being marketed  primarily by Societe D'Etudes  Dermatologiques  ("Sederma")  under the tradename "Norgel".  Sederma is the Company's  distributor of LUBRAJEL in France and a major European  cosmetic  ingredient  supplier.  It is also distributed by some of the Company's other marketing partners under the name LUBRAJEL PF. Tests conducted by Sederma indicated that the product self-preserved, and aided in the preservation of other cosmetic  ingredients with which it was formulated. LUBRASIL(TM)  and  LUBRASIL  DS are  special  types  of  LUBRAJEL  in which silicone oil is incorporated into a LUBRAJEL base by microemulsification,  while maintaining much of the clarity of regular  LUBRAJEL.  The products have a silky feel, and are water  resistant  while  moisturizing  the skin.  (These sales are already included in the total Lubrajel sales figure mentioned previously). Other products that do not have  significant  sales at the present time but have the  potential  for  increased  sales in the  future,  and which as a group constituted approximately 2% of the Company's sales in 2005, are as follows: CONFETTI(TM)DERMAL  DELIVERY  FLAKES is a product line  introduced  in 2000 that  incorporates  various  functional  oil-soluble  ingredients  into colorful flakes that can be added to, and suspended in, various water-based products. The product color and  ingredients can be customized to meet the needs of individual customers. ORCHID  COMPLEX(TM) is a successor product to the Company's previous Oil of Orchids  product and is a base for skin creams,  lotions,  cleansers,  and other cosmetics. This product is an extract of fresh orchids, modified by extractants, stabilizers, and preservatives, and is characterized by its excellent lubricity, spreadability and light emolliency.  Because of its alcohol  solubility,  it may also be used in fragrance  products such as perfumes and  toiletries.  Its light emolliency lends use in shampoos, bath products and facial cleansers. It is also a superior emollient for sunscreens,  vitamin creams, toners and skin serums. It is sold in two forms, water-soluble and oil soluble. UNITWIX(R)  is a  cosmetic  additive  used  as a  thickener  for  oils  and oil-based liquids. It is a proprietary, unpatented product that does not require government  approval to market. LUBRASLIDE(TM) and a related product,  B-122(TM),  are powdered  lubricants used in the manufacture of cosmetics such as pressed  powders,  eye liners,  and rouges.  They are used as  binders  for these  products,  increasing  their drop strength and lowering the coefficient of friction and water-repellency. RAZORIDE(TM) is a clear, hypo-allergenic,  non-foaming, water-based shaving product  that is  surfactant  and  soap-free  and has  excellent  lubricity  and moisturizing properties. DESELEX(R) is a replacement for phosphates in detergents. HYDRAJEL  PL and  HYDRAJEL  VM are  personal  lubricants  and  moisturizers developed  specifically  for the feminine  personal care market. Development Activities Guardian's Research and Development Department has developed a large number of  products  that  can be used  in many  different  industries,  including  the pharmaceutical,   medical,   cosmetic,   health  care,  and  specialty  chemical industries.  These  products are in various  stages of  development,  some being currently  marketable  and some  being in the very early  stages of  development requiring  a  substantial  amount of  development  work to bring them to market. Research is also being done on new uses for currently marketed products.  Once a product is  created,  the initial  development  work on it may consist of one or more of the following:  (a) laboratory  refinements  and adjustments to suit the intended uses of the product;  (b) stability  studies to determine the effective shelf-life of the product and suitable storage and transportation conditions for the product; and (c) laboratory efficacy tests to determine the effectiveness of the product under different conditions. After the Research and  Development  Department  has  completed its initial work on a product  and is  satisfied  with the  results  of that  work,  further development work to bring the product to market will continue, including some or all of the following:  (a) animal and human clinical studies needed to determine safety and  effectiveness  of drug or medical  device  products,  which would be needed for  submissions  to the  appropriate  regulatory  agencies,  such as the United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  ("FDA")  or the  United  States Environmental  Protection Agency ("EPA"); (b) preparatory work for the filing of Investigational  New Drug  Applications  or New Drug  Applications;  (c)  market research to determine the marketability of the product,  including the potentialmarket size and most effective  method of marketing the product;  (d) scaling up from  laboratory  production  batches to pilot  batches,  and then to full scale production  batches,  including  the  determination  of the  type  of  equipment necessary to produce the products;  (e) upgrading or purchasing new equipment to manufacture  the  products;   and  (f)  the  negotiation  of  joint  venture  or distribution  agreements  to  develop  and/or  market the  product.  Some of the foregoing work may be done by outside contractors. While there can be no assurance that any particular  project will result in a new  marketable  product or a  commercially  successful  product,  the Company believes that a number of its  development  projects,  including those discussed below, may have commercial  potential if the Company's  development  efforts are successful. The Company's  major  research  focus is the  development of new and unique personal care ingredients. The following are some of the projects the Company is either working on at the present time or which the Company intends to work on in the near future: NEW FORM OF LUBRASIL: This will be a new addition to the Company's Lubrasil product  line  that will  contain a much  higher  level of  silicone,  which the Company  believes  will create an  expanded  market for these types of skin care products. SELF-PRESERVING POLYMERIC THICKENER: This product will be a self-preserving raw material for cosmetic use that will enable cosmetic formulators to formulate preservative free cosmetic products. SKIN  SENSORIAL  AGENTS:  A line of products  that will enhance the feel of skin care products.  The new Lubrasil mentioned above might be one such product. MICROEMULSIFIED  ANTIMICROBIAL:  This would be a new form of  antimicrobial product for use in skin disinfection  products. The product could be sold either as a raw material or as a finished product in a hand cleanser. LUBRAJEL II: This product line was being developed to recapture some of the market  share  that  the  Company  has  lost  over  the  years  to  some  of its competitors. The first product in this line, LUBRAJEL II XD, was developed to be a drop-in replacement for one of those products, and is currently being actively marketed. The Company hopes to expand this product line over the next few years, introducing new  formulations  that have enhanced  properties  over  competitive products.  This new line is intended to be a supplement to, not replacement for, the current line of Lubrajel products. Its composition also will enable it to be used in certain countries,  such as Japan, more easily than the current Lubrajel formulations.  Because other projects have higher  priority,  it is not expected that there will be new products launched in this line in 2006. CLORONINE:  Cloronine is a powerful disinfectant,  germicide, and sanitizer for disinfecting  medical and surgical  instruments and equipment  (particularly where autoclaves are not available), and for the purification of water supplies. The product had been  approved  for  certain  uses in France and Canada,  and is still being sold on a very  limited  basis in Canada.  The Company is  currently working  with a new  potential  customer  for  this  product  that is  exploring possible use by the government as a decontamination agent. However,  before this product can be marketed in the United States for any purpose,  additional  testswill have to be done to determine if the product can be registered  with the EPA as  a  sterilant   or   germicide.   These  tests  would   comprise   laboratory microbiological  studies,  compatibility  studies,  and specific  studies on its intended  uses.  The product may also have to be  registered  with the FDA as an accessory to a medical device.  Neither  registration process has yet begun. Due to the expense and time  required,  the Company hopes to work jointly with other companies to obtain these registrations. The Company was granted two patents for this product. CLORONINE  GEL: This would be another form of Cloronine in gel form,  which may increase its effectiveness and functionality. The Company  expects its research and  development  costs for FY-2006 to be comparable to those of the last two fiscal  years.  Any  additional  increase in development  and/or production costs will depend on whether capital  investments are required in order to continue development work on, or to manufacture, any of the new products under development. Trademarks and Patents The Company strongly  believes in protecting its intellectual  property and intends  whenever  possible to make efforts to obtain patents in connection with its product development  program.  The Company currently owns many United States patents  and  trademarks  relating to its  products.  The Company has patent and trademark  applications  pending  with  respect to a number of its  research and development  products.  Patents formerly held by the Company on certain products have  expired.  There can be no  assurance  that any patents held by the Company will be valid or  otherwise  of value to the Company or that any patent  applied for  will be  granted.  However,  the  Company  believes  that  its  proprietary manufacturing  techniques and procedures with respect to certain  products offer it some  protection  from  duplication by  competitors  regardless of the patent status of the products. The  various  trademarks  and trade  names  owned or used by the Company in Guardian's  business  are  of  varying  importance  to  the  Company.  The  most significant  products  for which the  Company  has a  registered  trademark  are LUBRAJEL, RENACIDIN, and CLORPACTIN.

 The  Company  requires  all  employees  and  consultants  who  may  receive proprietary information to agree in writing to keep such proprietary information confidential. Eastern Chemical Corporation Eastern is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of the Company.  It  distributes  an extensive line of fine organic chemicals,  research  chemicals,  test solutions, indicators,  dyes and stains,  and reagents.  In 2005 and 2004  Eastern's  sales accounted for  approximately  9% and 10% respectively of the total product sales of the Company. The Company's business activities and marketing efforts over the past several years have focused increasingly on the Guardian division, which the Company  believes has greater growth  potential than Eastern.  As a result,  the Company has been reducing the amount of inventory kept on hand by Eastern, which in turn has resulted in some decline in its sales. There also has been a general decrease in Eastern's  business due to  competition  from new  companies in this field.  The  Company  has  considered,   and  will  continue  to  consider,  the possibility  of selling  Eastern at such time as it determines  that keeping the operation is no longer in the Company's  best  interests.  The Company  believes that if it were to sell Eastern,  the loss of revenue from that subsidiary would not have a material impact on the Company's net income. Marketing Guardian markets its products through (a) distributors;  (b) advertising in medical and trade journals,  by mailings to physicians and to the trade; and (c) exhibitions at appropriate  medical meetings.  The  pharmaceutical  products are sold in the United States  primarily to drug wholesalers that distribute to drug stores for resale, and to hospitals,  physicians, long-term care facilities, the Veteran's  Administration,   and  other  government  agencies.  The  proprietary personal  care and  specialty  chemical  products are sold to  distributors  for resale and directly to manufacturers  for use as ingredients or additives in the manufacture  or  compounding  of their  cosmetic,  personal  care, or industrial products. Eastern's  products are marketed through  advertising in trade publications and direct  mailings.  They are sold to distributors  and directly to users in a wide variety of  applications.  Eastern does not sell any unique products and is not  dependent  on any single  customer or group of  customers  on a  continuous basis. Domestic Sales In  the  United  States,  the  Company's  cosmetic  products  are  marketed exclusively by ISP in accordance with a marketing agreement entered into in 1996 and  subsequently  amended and expanded in 2000,  2002, and 2005 (see "Marketing Agreements"  below).  ISP also has certain  rights to sell some of the Company's other industrial and medical products. In 2005, ISP's purchases for distribution in the United States were estimated to be approximately  $1,237,000  compared to $1,394,000 in 2004, a decrease of 11%, and accounted  for  approximately  10% of the Company's  sales (NOTE:  ISP's domestic sales figure is an estimate based on sales  information  provided  to the  Company by ISP.  The Company has no way of independently determining which of ISP's purchases from the Company are intended for domestic sale and which are intended for foreign sale.) The Company believes that the  decrease in ISP's  domestic  sales of the  Company's  products was the result  of the  discontinuation  by  some  of the  Company's  customers  of some products that contained the Company's raw materials.  However,  this decrease in ISP's  domestic  sales was offset by an increase in ISP's  foreign  sales of the Company's product. The  Company's  domestic  sales  of  pharmaceutical  products  are  handled primarily   through  the  major  full-line  drug  wholesalers  and  account  for approximately 20% of the Company's sales. The Company's other products,  such as its  industrial  products,  are sold  directly to end-users and account for less than 1% of sales. Foreign Sales In 2005 and 2004 the Company derived approximately 51% and 49% respectively of its sales from  customers in foreign  countries,  primarily from sales of its cosmetic products in Europe and Asia. The Company currently has six distributors for its personal care  products  outside the United  States,  with ISP being the largest. ISP has global distribution rights with the exception of the following: S. Black Ltd. in the United Kingdom;  Sederma in France; Luigi & Felice Castelli S.R.L. in Italy; S. Black Gmbh in Switzerland;  and C&M  International in Korea. The Company's foreign sales attributable to each of its foreign  distributors as a percentage of the Company's total sales were as follows: ISP: 27% (an estimate of ISP's  purchases  intended for sale outside the U.S.,  based on sales figures provided to the Company by ISP); Sederma:  11%; S. Black: 4%; C&M International: 4%; and Castelli: 1%. The Company also has two foreign customers for its medical products that each account for approximately 1% of the Company's total sales. Marketing Agreements In 1994 the Company entered into a marketing agreement with ISP whereby ISP would distribute the Company's  personal care products,  as well as some medical and  industrial  products,  in certain  parts of Europe,  Asia,  Australia,  and Africa.  ISP  manufactures  and  markets an  extensive  line of  personal  care, pharmaceutical,  and industrial  products on a global basis. In 1996 the parties entered into  another  agreement,  extending  those  distribution  rights to theUnited States,  Canada,  Mexico,  Central and South America.  In July,  2000 the parties entered into an Exclusive  Marketing  Agreement (the "2000  Agreement"), which modified,  extended,  and consolidated  the 1994 and 1996 agreements.  The 2000 Agreement  also gave the Company  greater  flexibility in appointing  other marketing partners in areas where ISP was not active or had not been successful, gave ISP certain  additional  territories,  and granted ISP  exclusivity  in the territories assigned to it as long as annual minimum purchase  requirements were met. In  December,  2002 the  parties  entered  into a letter  agreement  ("2002 Agreement")  that  extended  and modified  the 2000  Agreement  and provided for automatic  extensions of the 2000 Agreement through December,  2008 provided ISP met certain  purchase  requirements  during each calendar year of the agreement. ISP was not able to meet the minumum  purchase  requirement  for  calendar  year 2003,  but the Company agreed to continue  ISP's  marketing  rights based on its satisfaction with ISP's marketing efforts. In December,  2005 the parties entered into another letter agreement ("2005 Agreement"  modifying  and  extending the 2000  Agreement  and  superceding  and replacing the 2002 Agreement. The 2005 Agreement extended ISP's marketing rights until December,  2008, and provided for the possibility of additional  automatic extensions  until  December,  2010 if specified  miniumum annual purchase levels were  attained.  It also specifed  guideliness  and  provisions for future price increases by the Company. The  Company  believes  that in the event ISP were to cease  marketing  the Company's products, alternative arrangements could be made to continue to supply product to the  customers  currently  using the Company's  products  without any significant interruption of supply. The Company has other marketing arrangements with marketing partners in the U.K, France, Switzerland,  Korea, and Italy, but all of these other arrangements are operating under either verbal agreements or expired written agreements,  and are subject to termination at any time by either party. Raw Materials The  principal  raw  materials  used  by  the  Company  consist  of  common industrial  organic  chemicals,   laboratory  reagents,   and  common  inorganic chemicals.  Most of these  materials are available in ample supply from numerous sources.  The Company's principal raw material suppliers are Procter and Gamble, Callahan  Chemical Company,  Univar USA, Inc.,  Noveon,  Inc.,  Ishihara U.S.A., Nissei Trading Co., Varessa,  Ltd., E.I. duPont,  S.A. Fine Chemicals,  and Loba Chemie. Inventories; Returns and Allowances The Company's  business requires that it maintain  moderate  inventories of certain of its finished  goods.  Historically,  returns and allowances  have not been a significant factor in the Company's business. Backlog The Company currently does not have any significant backlog. Competition Guardian  has many  products or processes  that are either  unique in their field or have  some  unique  characteristics,  and  therefore  are not in direct competition  with the products or processes  of other  pharmaceutical,  personal care, chemical,  or health care companies.  However, the pharmaceutical,  health care,  and  cosmetic  industries  are all highly  competitive,  and the  Company expects  competition  to  intensify as advances in the field are made and become widely known.  There may be many domestic and foreign companies that are engaged in the same or  similar  areas of  research  as those in which  the  Company  is engaged, many of which have substantially greater financial, research, manpower, marketing and distribution  resources than the Company.  In addition,  there are many large,  integrated and  established  pharmaceutical,  chemical and cosmetic companies  that  have  greater  capacity  than the  Company  to  develop  and to commercialize   types  of  products  upon  which  the  Company's   research  and development  programs are based.  However, the Company believes that the expense of testing and evaluating  possible  substitutes for Company's products that are already in  customers'  formulations,  as well as the expense to the customer in relabeling  its products,  is a significant  barrier to displacing the Company's products  in current  customer  formulations.  These cost  factors  make it less likely that a customer  would choose a  competitive  product  unless there was a significant cost savings in doing so. The Company  believes that  manufacturing, regulatory,  distribution and marketing expertise will be increasingly important competitive  factors  in favor  of the  Company.  In this  regard,  the  Company believes that its marketing arrangements with its global marketing partners will be  important  in the  commercialization  of many of the  products  which  it is currently developing. Eastern  faces  competition  from many  other  chemical  manufacturers  and distributors,  many of which have much greater financial resources than those of the Company.  Eastern's  competition is based primarily upon price,  service and quality.  Eastern attempts to maintain its competitive  position in the industry through its ability to (i) locate and make  wholesale  arrangements  to purchase the  chemicals  with  suppliers  located  all over the  world,  (ii)  maintain a sufficient inventory of its most popular items at all times, and (iii) customize each order as to quantity of the item  requested  and to tailor the price of the order to such quantity.  Eastern's  primary  competitors  are SA Fine Chemicals, Acros Organics, Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc., and Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp. ISO-9001:2000 REGISTRATION In  December,  2003 the  Company  earned ISO  9001:2000  registration  from Underwriters  Laboratories,  Inc.,  indicating  that  the  Company's  documented procedures and overall  operations had attained the high level of quality needed to  comply  with this new ISO  certification  level,  and has been in  continual compliance with that new standard since that initial approval. Prior to that, in November,  1998 the Company had earned ISO-9002  registration.  The Company will continue to be evaluated every six months for continued  compliance with the new ISO-9001:2000  standard. Government Regulation Regulation  by  governmental  authorities  in the  United  States and other countries is a significant  factor in the manufacturing and marketing of many of the  Company's  products.  The Company and many of the  Company's  products  aresubject to certain  government  regulations.  Products that may be developed and sold by the  Company in the United  States may  require  approval  from  federal regulatory  agencies,  such as the FDA,  as well as state  regulatory  agencies. Products  that may be  developed  and sold by the Company  outside of the United States may require approval from foreign regulatory agencies. Any medical device products  developed by the Company will be subject to  regulation  by the Center for Devices  and  Radiological  Health of the FDA,  and will  usually  require a 510(k)  pre-market  notification.  Most  pharmaceutical  products  will  require clinical  evaluation under an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application prior to  submission  of a New Drug  Application  ("NDA")  for  approval of a new drug product. A drug product  normally must go through  several phases in order to obtain FDA approval.  The research phase  involves work up to and including  discovery, research, and initial production. Next is the pre-clinical phase, which involves studies in animal models  necessary to support an IND application to the FDA and foreign health registration  authorities to commence clinical testing in humans. Clinical trials for  pharmaceutical  products are conducted in three phases.  In Phase I, studies are  conducted to  determine  safety and dosages.  In Phase II, studies are  conducted  to gain  preliminary  evidence as to the efficacy of the product.  In Phase III, studies are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy,  including dose regimen.  Phase III is the  final  stage  of  such  clinical  studies  prior  to the  submission  of an application for approval of an NDA. The amount of time necessary to complete any of these phases cannot be predicted with any certainty. In all cases,  the Company is required  to comply with all  pertinent  Good Manufacturing  Practices of the FDA for medical devices and drugs.  Accordingly, the regulations to which the Company and certain of its products may be subject, and any changes  with  respect  thereto,  may  materially  affect the  Company's ability to produce and market new products developed by the Company. The Company's  present and future  activities are, and will likely continue to  be,  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  additional   regulation   under  the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Environmental Protection Act, import, export and customs regulations, and other present and possible future foreign, federal, state and local regulations. Portions of the Company's  operating expenses are directly  attributable to complying with federal, state, and local environmental statutes and regulations. In 2005  and  2004  the  Company  incurred  approximately  $49,000  and  $48,000 respectively, in environmental compliance costs. There was no material financial or other  impact on the  Company as a result of  compliance  with  environmental laws. Research and Development Expense Portions of the Company's  operating expenses are directly  attributable to research and  development  the Company  performs.  In 2005 and 2004, the Company incurred  approximately  $423,000  and  $415,000  respectively  in research  and development  expenses.  No portion of the research and development  expenses was directly paid by the Company's customers. Employees The Company  presently  employs 43 people,  8 of whom serve in an executive capacity,  23 in research,  quality control and manufacturing,  5 in maintenance and construction,  and 7 in office and administrative  work. Of the total numberof employees,  40 are full time employees.  None of the Company's  employees are covered by a collective  bargaining  agreement.  The Company  believes  that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.
