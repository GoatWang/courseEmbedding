Kathy Giusti and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation
Richard G. Hamermesh, Joshua D. Margolis and Matthew G. Preble
What do you do when your rising professional career is cut short by an unexpected cancer diagnosis? Kathy Giusti shifted careers, built a new organization that transformed how cancer research is done, and now faces the challenge of sustaining the organization and its funding for its newest venture.

Since she was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) in 1996, Giusti had led an effort to better understand and treat the disease. She had co-founded the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), helped form the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC), and brought together a diverse body of academics, researchers, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, physicians, and patients to combine their efforts around the disease. The MMRF had helped facilitate clinical trials for promising drugs, sponsored research, and raised a substantial amount of money for these purposes.

In 2014, the MMRF was in the midst of its CoMMpass program; a multi-year effort to collect tissue samples from 1,000 patients at key junctures in their disease, sequence these samples to better understand the genetic underpinnings of MM and its many sub-types, and thus enable researchers to study a comprehensive sampling of patients. CoMMpass also had a patient-facing element which allowed the patient community to communicate with one another and with professional moderators. By mid-2014, some 550 patients were enrolled and 85 hospitals were participating.

As a non-profit, the MMRF had historically relied on donations to fund its research operations. Giusti wanted to find a way to ensure a reliable revenue stream for the organization and give it greater financial stability. The MMRF had historically given away its resources and knowledge for free in order to speed research; Giusti worried if charging for some of its functions would be at odds with its mission and historical practices. She worked with her executive team to examine potential sources of revenue, and to decide if this was the right thing to do.

ShotSpotter: A Gunfire Detection Business Looks for a New Market

ShotSpotter provides gunfire detection sensors to cities across the United States. CEO Ralph Clark is interested in taking the company beyond its business-to-government sales model and into new markets. Could his company sell to schools and colleges? Could the technology be adapted for indoor applications like shopping malls and movie theaters? Could cities use it as an early alert to a terrorist attack? Professor Mitch Weiss discusses the difficulties moving from one business model to another,  and how successful companies make the transition.

A Microchip in Your Medicine

									
											Digitally-enabled prescription medication may sound futuristic. Thanks to Proteus, the future is now. The company has developed the technology to place microchips inside prescription pills, allowing doctors to retrieve real-time updates on everything from dosing, to vital signs, to the efficacy of different medications. However, regulating and marketing such ground-breaking technology is almost as complicated as the medical conditions it can help cure. Professor Richard Hamermesh unpacks the challenges of changing the world of medicine.

Health Care Under a Research Microscope
by Sean Silverthorne

							
									Perhaps no industry has caught the research attention of Harvard Business School faculty as much as health care. Researchers are investigating business-focused solutions on everything from improving team work among surgical teams to developing market motivations that increase the use of water purification in poor villages. Key concepts include: The $2 trillion American health care system has grown bloated and overly expensive, and it delivers poor service to many patients. Harvard Business School faculty are looking at the system through a business management perspective to recommend changes in almost all aspects of health care research and delivery. Around the world, HBS researchers are studying ways to improve medical services to the poor using techniques that include everything from motivational marketing to microfinance.

Encourage Breakthrough Health Care by Competing on Products Rather Than Patents
 

 For too long, the science behind breakthrough therapeutics has been locked behind patents held by universities. Richard Hamermesh proposes the market compete on solutions rather than intellectual property rights. 
 
by Richard G. Hamermesh
Like many people interested in the tangled connections between health care progress and intellectual property rights, I avidly followed the  Myriad Genetics case, decided by the Supreme Court this June 13. In sum, molecular diagnostics maker Myriad sought "the exclusive right to isolate an individual's BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes," but the Court, wisely I believe, made thoughtful distinctions about what is and is not patentable, deciding that, "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible because it has been isolated…"
Of course, had the University of Utah not given Myriad an exclusive license to a discovery the university made in its own labs, there may have been no need for a conflict whatsoever. But among other things, the dispute resonates deeply with a call to action made by Eric Lander, President and Founding Director, The Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, at November's Healing Ourselves Health Care Forum event. There, Lander made a potent case for creating a multi-corporate consortium that would openly share validated targets. Instead of stalling progress by withholding information on targets, he argued, they should open target data and compete on solutions—compounds and molecules addressing the targets.
I agree. If we're going to get the breakthrough products we want at a development cost we can afford, we have to figure out the best place to set the line between public and private interests, between the "intellectual commons" that benefits us all, and the intellectual property protection that encourages innovation and investment. What should be opened to the commons? What should be held by private interests?
“The majority of significant discoveries come from university labs and hospitals”
Given the stakes, these are more than academic questions. But I believe the academy can assert leadership on these issues. Let's face it: the majority of significant discoveries come from university labs and hospitals; their ownership of intellectual property gives them enormous influence over the distribution of knowledge. To date, they have been far too concerned with the size of their royalties, at the expense of public utility.
The fate of discoveries we all rely upon, and the intellectual property that results from them, rests in the hands of university technology licensing offices. Here's my proposal: I ask that the Association of University Technology Managers 
establish a set of standards, balancing public interests and private incentives, that would encourage the development of new chemical entities for reducing human suffering.
As Lander had suggested, anything having to do with genes, molecular pathways, and targets should be made openly available, or at least not subject to exclusive licensing. Instead, we should encourage competition around the development of molecules that interfere with or enhance activity in these pathways, rewarding the creators with the usual private incentives.
Can we agree to compete on therapeutic solutions, not on the underlying science we need to develop them? I'd like to hear your reflections on the matter: What should be in the commons, what should remain private? Where can we set the line to yield the most breakthrough drugs?

Description






Publication Date: May 03, 2012

 Shelby Givens, a new MBA, is the general manager of Westlake Lanes, a near-bankrupt bowling alley that her grandfather founded decades earlier. Givens has been given one year to turn a profit; if the goal is not met Westlake will close. During the first few days on the job, Givens learns that the business is in worse shape financially than she - or the board - thought. She also finds that Westlake's employees exhibit minimal productivity. Givens tackles these two issues, creatively uncovering ways to reduce costs while building morale. After nine months, the business has its first profitable month in over two years. Yet Givens is worried it is too little, too late and begins to sketch a bolder long-term strategy based on pursuing one of two alternative new markets. Students are invited to consider whether the board should accept her potentially transformative proposal, maintain existing operations, or liquidate to pay off pressing loan responsibilities. The case includes a quantitative assignment for students.

Makes microeconomics interesting

By Dennis Thompson
I chose to review this one because it was one of the better college textbooks explaining in understandable language the decisions that businesses and individuals make and the effect they have on pricing as well as supply and demand in the economy.  I certainly enjoyed it more than my macroeconomics textbook, but that could be simply because of the nature of the subject at hand.  When I was younger, still in school, I was less concerned with broad high level issues than things I could directly relate to and immediately apply my knowledge in.  I believe that this microeconomics course/book was what in fact planted a lifelong interest in businesses and particularly start-ups in me.
