Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

					Zonda 5.0 Brings Color Changes To Map Icons				

05/14/2017 Get a look at the key icon color and shape design changes in our new release.
We’re excited to share a couple of design changes with you which are part of the Zonda 5.0 release. This exciting and ambitious release enables benchmarking of live MLS listings across the country at the touch of your fingertips.
Integrating the new MLS listings data into Zonda required us to redefine the colors and design of the map icons to be more consistent across an expanded range of data sets. We needed to simplify and unify elements in order to make the experience for new and existing users even more intuitive. To help you get familiar with these changes, we have documented the design changes for the icons below.
 
Color Story
Our design process led us to refine our data “color story” to bring a dependable color progression to icon statuses. Many of the icons in our app represent a moment of time within a transaction, be it a parcel of land, a community or a house. These products move through a cycle of coming to the market, being on the market to selling, and can also end up in a distress condition. We have created a color spectrum to which these statuses map to provide you with an intuitive experience navigating the Zonda app.

 
Project Icons
Projects are designated with a hammer icon. Find them on CBSA, county, city and zip code when you are on the Supply, Sales and Price tab.

Color update: upcoming project is a gray hammer icon
Color update: sold out project is a green hammer icon


 
Land Listing Icons
Land listings are designated with a shovel icon. Find them on CBSA, county, city and zip code when you are on the Supply tab. This feature is part of Zonda Land subscription.

No updates


 
Sales Icons
Listings are designated by a sales tag icon. Find them on city and zip code when you are on the Supply tab. Closings are also designated by a sales tag icon. Find them on city and zip code when you are on the Sales and Prices tab. Foreclosure Sales are represented by a sales tag icon. NOD (Notice of Default) and Foreclosures are represented by a flag icon, since they are reported by a bank. Find all of them on city and zip code when you are on the Distress tab.

New: new MLS listing light blue sales tag icon
New: existing MLS listing blue sales tag icon
Color and shape update: new closing light green sales tag icon
Color and shape update: existing closing dark green sales tag icon
Color and shape update: NOD (Notice of Default) light orange flag icon
Color and shape update: Foreclosure orange flag icon
Color and shape update: Foreclosure sale dark orange sales tag icon


 
Site Icons
Sites are designated with a pin icon. Access saved sites from the map or from your profile. To create a site, tap and hold on the map till you see a pin drop. This feature is part of Zonda Land subscription.

Color update: saved site a gray pin icon
Color update: sold site a green pin icon


 
Top Employer Icons
These icons visually weight companies who are providing the largest amount of jobs in the region, ranking 1-10 going from largest to smallest. Find them on counties when you are on the Economy tab.

No updates


 
School Icons
The school icons, denoted by a graduation cap, progress in color relative to grade level, going from lighter to darker blue. A mix of two or more types of schools are shown in gray. Find them on CBSA, county, cities and zip codes when you are on the Community tab.

No updates


 
Icon Legend
When you tap any of the icons on the map, you will see popup with details, as well as an icon legend at the top of the popup available for your reference.

We’re pleased we could bring more clarity and consistency to your Zonda experience. Thank you for checking out the updates. To schedule a Zonda demo of the new features get in touch with our team.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
