Testimonials
Kathy gave me my eyebrows back! Couldn't believe the difference - wish I had had them done years ago. I have had so many comments on my eyebrows - people say they look so natural and they make me look younger. Kathy takes time in making sure you're happy with the colour and the shape. I found the experience very relaxing - I even fell asleep at one point! I will be back again when my eyebrows need topping up and recommend anyone using Kathy - she is a star.
Kaye, Sheffield
Just had to say a very big thank you for my eyebrows. I'm thrilled to bits with them, no problems, done exactly as you said.
Friends that knew I was having them done have said they are the best they have ever seen. I can't begin to explain what a difference they have made to my face, self esteem and confidence. Once again many many thanks.
Tricia, Sheffield
"I'd like to thank Kathy for restoring my eyebrows and confidence. I highly recommend her services. She works in a bespoke manner providing sound advice to what will suit you. I also had my eyeliner done at the same time. This has made such a difference to me. Fabulous decision.Thanks again Kathy."
Michele, Sheffield
"My eyebrows are FANTASTIC I feel like a million dollars!!
Kathy’s expertise is what made me chose her. Her qualifications are genuine and her care is utterly professional. My eyebrows have totally transformed my face and make me look younger. I feel like a new women so much so I'm going back to have my lips lined.I am an extremely satisfied customer. Thank you so much Kathy."
Gill, Sheffield
 
"I approached my appointment for 'eyebrows and eye liner' with considerable trepidation and some embarrassment that, at my age, I was so vain! However, Kathy's quiet, confident and highly professional manner quickly reassured me and the procedure was almost enjoyable!I am absolutely delighted with the outcome. For the first time in my life I have beautiful eyebrows and I can go out into the world with so much less make up! Thank you, Kathy."
Ann, Sheffield
"Thank you so much Kathy for giving me back my eyebrows I absolutely love them, my eyeliner is great too. You're a lovely lady doing such amazing work - keep it up! You're a star!!!"
Chrissy, Chesterfield Derbyshire
“My experience of having semi-permanent eyebrows was absolutely brilliant! Kathy is very professional, yet reassuring and made me feel really at ease throughout the procedure. She took the time to listen to what I wanted and offered great advice! I am absolutely thrilled with my new eyebrows and cannot recommend Kathy highly enough – I am one very satisfied customer!”
Eva, Derbyshire
“Thank you so much, Kathy, for giving me back my eyebrows - I love them! I had been considering semi-permanent makeup for a long time, but was really nervous about choosing the right person to carry out the procedure. Thankfully, I was recommended to Kathy and from the first time we met at the initial consultation I knew I had made the right choice.
Kathy is a very friendly lady and immediately put me at ease. She showed me photographs of her previous work and explained the procedure in full. I had no hesitation in booking an appointment there and then
The procedure was pain-free, thanks to the ‘magic’ anaesthetic cream, and Kathy was very precise in her work, checking at various stages to ensure I was happy with the result. My sister and friend have both booked appointments too, and I have since had my eye liner done.”
Jo, Sheffield
“Just to say thank you so much for the work you did on my eyebrows last night. They look fantastic and I have had a lot of interest and compliments at work today. My husband also thinks they look good and he was really against me having them done - I don't know why, it must be a man thing!!
Pam, Sheffield
“I am so pleased with my eyebrows! I was very anxious about having them tattooed (what if I didn’t like them? would it be painful? how permanent is semi-permanent?), but Kathy was very professional throughout, taking time to discuss and agree colours that toned with my hair and skin colouring, style etc. which was very reassuring. I am totally delighted with the end results and would recommend her most highly - and no, it wasn’t painful!"
Elaine, Sheffield
“My new eyebrows are superb - giving my face definition and balance. Kathy is so lovely, and her whole approach, along with the care and attention she puts into her work, is fantastic, and the end result is excellent! Now my daughter is jealous and wants some too!”
Gaynor, Sheffield
“Kathy matched my favourite lip pencil colour and outlined my lips exactly as I wanted. Although tender at the time, it has been great to have my lips outlined semi-permanently!”
Jackie, Derbyshire
“I love my new eyebrows! Kathy made a great job of re touching them. A good colour match and shape. I would recommend Kathy to anyone! Another satisfied customer!”
Maxine, Sheffield
"I had my eyeliner tattooed by Kathy 3 weeks ago. I absolutely love the result and although it looks fab everyday I really appreciated it on a recent holiday abroad. Would recommend it to anyone, just wish I'd had it done years ago!"
Jude, Sheffield
"I would highly recommend Kathy to anyone contemplating Semi permanent makeup. I requested very defined brows and Kathy listened to my requirements and delivered to an excellent standard. I have had the procedure carried out by other practitioners previously costing nearly double what Kathy charges and I would not hesitate to return to Kathy for any semi permanent procedures - the smile on my face upon looking in the mirror at the final product is priceless."
Tracy, Sheffield
