Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

Azure Midstream Partners, LP Announces Effectiveness of Plan of Liquidation

DALLAS, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, on May 19, 2017 the United State Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the "Court") approved Azure Midstream Partners, LP,'s (the "Partnership" and together with its general partner and direct and indirect subsidiaries, "Azure" or "Debtors") Fifth Amended and Restated Plan of Liquidation (the "Plan") filed with the Court on May 18, 2017, Case No. 17-30461 ("Confirmation Order").  On June 2, 2017, all conditions to the occurrence of the effective date (the "Effective Date") set forth in the Plan and Confirmation Order were satisfied or waived in accordance therewith and the Effective Date occurred.  On the same date, the Partnership filed a notice of Effective Date of the Plan with the Court.








As previously disclosed on January 30, 2017, Azure filed voluntary petitions with the Court under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
In accordance with the Plan, as of the Effective Date all common units have been cancelled without consideration and an entity formed pursuant to the Plan (the "Azure Custodian") holds a single new unit of the Partnership's common units as custodian for the benefit of the former unitholders, consistent with such unitholders' former relative priority and economic entitlements. Awards granted and vested under the partnership's 2013 long term incentive plan will be converted into the right to receive the amount, if any, they would be entitled to as holders of the equivalent number of common units vested and issued as of April 28, 2017.  Also as of the Effective Date, all of the Partnership's direct and indirect subsidiaries have been merged with and into the Partnership with the Partnership being the sole survivor of the merger.  As soon as practicable and in accordance with the Plan, Azure's corporate existence will be terminated.
Under the terms of the Plan, a portion of the allowed, secured claims arising under Debtors' prepetition credit agreement (the "Secured Claims") shall continue to be paid pursuant to the Plan and, thereafter, the Debtors shall pay all allowed tax claims, administrative expense claims, professional fees and expenses, general unsecured claims, and any costs associated with winding down the Debtors' estates.  After such claims have been paid in full, any remaining cash will be used to first satisfy the remainder of allowed Secured Claims.  If any cash remains in the Debtors' estates after satisfying the prepetition Secured Claims and all other allowed claims, and after liquidating the all remaining assets of the Debtors' estates, the Plan provides that Azure Custodian shall receive all such remaining cash, which will be distributed on a pro rata share to the common unitholders.  As previously disclosed, it is unlikely that any common unitholders will receive any distributions.
Copies of the Plan, the Court's order confirming the Plan and Azure's notice of Effective Date of the Plan are available at www.kccllc.net/azuremlp. Going forward, Azure will post press releases, if any, on the kccllc site as it plans to discontinue its use of the www.azuremidstream.com site in the near future.  We urge you to continue monitoring the kccllc website for important information and future press releases, if any, going forward.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This press release includes "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Partnership expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Terminology such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "project," "intend," "estimate," "believe," "target," "continue," "potential," the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, the consummation of the Plan and the Partnership's expectations and anticipated results with respect thereto. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Partnership based on its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances, but such assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Such statements are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Partnership, which may cause the Partnership's actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include risks and uncertainties relating to, among other things: the ability to consummate the Plan; the ultimate receipt of proceeds and the application and distribution of proceeds, which are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties; and no assurance can be made that distributions will not be made if claims by creditors are less than currently anticipated or proceeds ultimately received by the partnership are greater than currently expected. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. All forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, the Partnership undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise.

As someone who's built a career in the natural gas business by consistently delivering success, the events related to Azure's public company, Azure Midstream Partners ("AMP"), were extremely challenging, educational and profoundly disappointing for me.
Eighteen months ago, when crude and natural gas prices plunged and drilling activity declined to the lowest levels in recent decades, some of AMP's gas volumes declined, and our biggest customer/counterparty defaulted on a contract.  The combination of these events caused AMP to fall out of compliance with the terms of its bank covenants.
During 2016, we sought and were granted a series of waivers from the banks to work through possibilities to "fix" the MLP. The declining business environment and an onerous debt level limited our options with our bank group.
In parallel with this bank waiver process, the Azure management team tackled a multi-pronged strategic initiative to dramatically reduce costs, restructure non-performing contracts and raise capital through the sale of key, non-essential assets.  This dramatically improved the balance sheet and streamlined operations. In 2016 alone, we reduced our debt by $55 million (from $225 million to $170 million) while Azure's commercial team continued to capture new business (despite the challenging environment).
Unfortunately, our progress failed to convince the lenders to continue taking reasonable steps forward with us, and they indicated they would not continue to provide waivers.  This decision forced the board and management team to file Chapter 11 on January 30, 2017. Our goal in this action was to preserve and maximize value for all stakeholders. After an auction process, AMP's assets sold to Enterprise for $189 million (an increase of $37 million over the $152 million stalking horse bid).
Closing this sale of the AMP assets provided a complete recovery of the debt proceeds for our bank group, and allowed for the confirmation of our bankruptcy plan on June 2nd, 2017. The estate will be "wound down" by a transition team over the next few months led by Roy Bertolatus and supported by our private company, Azure Midstream Energy, LLC.
While we appreciate the expertise and professionalism of our bankruptcy lawyers and advisors, the process did cost the company approximately $20 million.  Our focus (and hope) in this wind down is to recover all amounts owed to our creditors, quickly settle all proofs of claim as approved by the court, and obtain some value for our unitholders.


For losses sustained by AMP unit holders, I am personally sorry. Sometimes in business an unexpected current can wash you far from your intended destination.  In many ways, AMP was caught up by larger forces – including historically low energy prices and OPEC's strategy to weaken America's energy industry.  We make no excuses, but we do hope that all stakeholders recognize that the Azure management team and employees worked assiduously through extreme conditions to significantly improve the business value and trajectory.
As a 40-year veteran of the natural gas industry, I have been privileged to work with many outstanding professionals.  However, the fortitude, grit, determination and sheer strength of will I witnessed by our CFO, Mandy Bush, and the entire senior management team, working through 1.5 years of forbearances and Chapter 11, all while running the business and marketing its assets, was humbling. If, as they say, "character is forged in fire," we have a team brimming with character and one that is battle-tested!
The lessons learned by the Azure management team over the past year are now embedded in everything we do running Azure's private company, Azure Midstream Energy.  We incorporated new ways of streamlining operations and cost cutting while maintaining industry-leading safety.  Azure won the GPA Midstream safety award last year for the third year in a row. We understand what it takes to fight for and win commercial opportunities in the most competitive circumstances, and we have a more highly-trained drive to continually improve our balance sheet through innovative initiatives.
Azure Midstream Energy is on track for $70 million in EBITDA this year and the future looks encouraging, particularly given the April 2017 report by the United State Geological Survey ("USGS") that the oil/gas resources contained within the Bossier & Haynesville formations are more than three times the estimate contained in their 2010 report.  The increase in drilling rig activity in the region from 14 rigs in November 2015 to 38 rigs in June 2017 is another indication that the basin is becoming economically attractive.  Azure's system is in the middle of both the Haynesville and Cotton Valley formations, and we are well positioned to take advantage of this very positive news.
We look forward to a bright future with you!

Berthelot said, “We continue to work our way through the financial challenges presented by this unprecedented extreme swing in the commodity pricing pendulum while executing consistently on all other aspects of our business Our relentless focus is on doing everything possible to enhance corporate value for our unitholders.”
Azure’s fourth quarter 2015 recurring operating expenses were $4.9 million, recurring general and administrative expenses were $2.4 million, depreciation and amortization expenses were $6.0 million, and interest expense was $2.7 million.
In summary, Azure Midstream Partners (AZUR) states that the decline in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and into 2016 has had a significant adverse impact on their business, and has impacted Azure’s ability to comply with its credit agreement.  They feel that is unlikely they will be able to comply with the leverage covenant currently contained in the credit agreement during the next twelve months.  Based upon their current estimates for commodity prices in 2016, they do not expect to remain in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants contained in their credit agreement throughout 2016 unless those requirements are waived or amended. Without those waivers or amendments, failure to meet these covenants and ratios would result in a default and an acceleration of the existing indebtedness, causing their debt of approximately $231.7 million to be immediately due and payable.  These conditions raise doubt about Azure’s ability to continue for a reasonable period of time.
If you have lost a significant amount in your investment in Azure Midstream Partners (AZUR), or any other energy related stock, contact Soreide Law Group for a no-cost review of your portfolio and the possibility of recovering your financial losses at:  888-760-6552.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
