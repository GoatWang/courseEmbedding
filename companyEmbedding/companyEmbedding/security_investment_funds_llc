About SSN

 

Securities Service Network, Inc. and its subsidiaries (SSN) operate as a broker dealer, registered investment advisor and insurance agency. This gives our affiliated advisors the opportunity to provide a broad range of investment options to investors. Our affiliated advisors are not employees of SSN, rather they choose to affiliate with SSN as independent contractors. This frees our advisors to choose the most suitable solutions without having the conflict of quotas or other employer/employee influences that could impede their relationships with investors.
Listed below is a brief description of each company and its purpose. The majority of our affiliated advisors offer a variety of investment products and services, which often requires them to be a combination of registered representative, investment advisor representative and insurance agent.
 

 
 
 
 






 


Securities Service Network, Inc.
Securities Service Network, Inc. (SSN) is an independent broker-dealer. A broker dealer can be defined as a person or company in the business of buying and selling securities—stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certain other investment products—on behalf of its customers (as broker), for its own account (as dealer), or both. SSN is registered with the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) and a member of FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority).
We are not Wall Street. We are not involved in investment banking, nor do we manufacture products. Our representatives  are not put in a position of having to choose an SSN created product. They have access to one of the broadest selections of products in the investment industry.
When you invest with your financial advisor, your assets are not held by your advisor or by Securities Service Network. They are either held directly with the specific product company (mutual fund, insurance company, etc.) or held in a brokerage account at one of our clearing firms, National Financial Services LLC, a Fidelity Investments company and Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.

 
 
 



Individuals affiliated with SSN are known as registered representatives. Individual registered representatives must register with FINRA, pass a qualifying examination, and be licensed by each state in which they conduct business. The products they offer investors depend on the type of licenses they hold with FINRA. When investors work with a representative, the representative generally receives a commission from the product company for the purchase of the security.
SSN is regulated by FINRA. You can obtain background information on SSN and any affiliated representative – including registration, licensing and disciplinary history – by visiting FINRA BrokerCheck.
SSN is a member of SIPC, which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). Explanatory brochure available upon request or at www.sipc.org.

 
 
 
 




SSN Advisory Inc.
SSN Advisory, Inc. is our Registered Investment Advisor. An Investment Advisor is a person or company who is paid for providing advice about securities to their clients. In addition to providing individually tailored investment advice, some investment advisors manage investment portfolios. Others may offer financial planning services or, if they are properly licensed, brokerage services (such as buying or selling stock or bonds)—or some combination of all these services.
In an advisory relationship, the advisor receives a fee for their services instead of a commission. This can be a flat fee, an hourly fee or a percentage based on assets under management. The investor and their advisor will establish a fee schedule when accounts are established.
SSN Advisory, Inc. is regulated by the SEC. You can get background information by visiting the SEC’s Investment Advisor Public Disclosure database.

 
 



 
 




 


Network Agency Inc.
So that our advisors can offer annuities and insurance, we are also licensed as an insurance agency. Every state, along with the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, has an insurance commission that licenses insurance agents and insurance companies who do business in that jurisdiction. You can contact your state insurance commissioner by visiting the Web site of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) at www.naic.org. If an insurance agent offers products that are considered securities—such as variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies—the agent must also be licensed as a registered representative and comply with FINRA rules.
Annuity and insurance sales typically generate a commission to be paid to the insurance agent. If the annuity or insurance policy is included in an advisory relationship, the investor may be paying fees to the advisor rather than a commission.

 
 
 



What is a clearing firm?
SSN has partnered with third-party firms for the clearing and custody of securities transactions – National Financial Services LLC, a Fidelity Investments company, and Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Both are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Their role of as custodian is the execution, clearance, and settlement of securities transactions, preparing and sending periodic statements of your account and transaction confirmations, and the custody (or safekeeping), receipt, and delivery of funds and securities.

Important: SANDLAPPER Securities, LLC. investment products and alternative investments are not FDIC insured, are not bank
guaranteed and may lose value
Alternative investment products, including real estate investments, notes & debentures, hedge funds and private equity, involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager. Alternative investment performance can be volatile. An investor could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment. Often, alternative investment fund and account managers have total trading authority over their funds or accounts; the use of a single advisor applying generally similar trading programs could mean lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk. There is often no secondary market for an investor’s interest in alternative investments, and none is expected to develop. There may be restrictions on transferring interests in any alternative investment. Alternative investment products often execute a substantial portion of their trades on non-U.S. exchanges. Investing in foreign markets may entail risks that differ from those associated with investments in U.S. markets. Additionally, alternative investments often entail commodity trading, which involves substantial risk of loss. NO OFFER OR SOLICITATION: The contents of this website: (i) do not constitute an offer of securities or a solicitation of an offer to buy of securities, and (ii) may not be relied upon in making an investment decision related to any investment offering by SANDLAPPER Securities, LLC, or any affiliate, or partner thereof (“Sandlapper”). Investment offerings and investment decisions may only be made on the basis of a confidential private placement memorandum issued by SANDLAPPER Securities, LLC, or one of its partner/issuers. Sandlapper does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information contained herein.

					Reflects net exposure to credit ratings by Moody's, S&P, and/or Fitch through direct investments in securities and credit default swap agreements, weighted based on notional value and assigned to lower rating of the underlying asset or counterparty. If there are multiple ratings for a security, the lowest rating is used unless ratings are provided by all three agencies, in which case the middle rating is used. AAA, AA, A, and BBB are investment grade ratings; BB, B, CCC/CC/C and D are below-investment grade ratings. Bonds backed by U.S. Government or agency securities are given an implied rating equal to the rating of such securities. NR reflects bonds not rated by Moody's, S&P, and/or Fitch. Negative exposure may result from the use of derivatives or unsettled trade positions. Credit ratings are subject to change. Total may not add up to 100% due to rounding.
				

					Credit Quality and Sector Allocation tables include exposures achieved through credit default swaps. Such exposures are reflected based on the notional value (rather than the market value) of the swaps, with exposures weighted negatively when the fund has purchased credit protection and positively when the Fund has sold credit protection. “Other” reflects an offset to (i.e., the inverse of) such notional amounts.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, call risk, derivatives risk, income risk, and index methodology risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Below investment grade or high yield debt securities are subject to liquidity risk and heightened credit risk. The guarantee provided by the U.S. government to treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) relates only to the prompt payment of principal and interest and does not remove the market risks of investing in the Fund shares. Foreign investments involve additional risks, including currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity and differing legal and accounting standards. Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default risk, and adverse economic developments. The Fund's investment in inflation protected securities has tax consequences that may result in income distributions to shareholders.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
