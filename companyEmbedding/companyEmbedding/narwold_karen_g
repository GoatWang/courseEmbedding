The work included almost every aspect of strategic planning, including mergers and acquisitions, anti-trust planning, financial planning, competitive analysis, capital restructuring, capital raising, including SEC and FINRA approvals and compliance, complex litigation planning, human resource processes, compensation and benefits administration and the highest level of corporate governance. She has exceptional intellectual horsepower and is extremely thorough, reliable and professionally dedicated. Her reliability, ownership and work ethic is second to none. She will lead, direct or support selflessly, subordinating to the specific needs of the system. She is strategically minded while still cognizant of (and attending to) the most critical details.  She is one of the most capable C-level professionals that I know and I would recommend her to (and as part of) the leadership of any team-based corporate management group.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended KarenGroupsGlobal Chemicals ExecutivesTheory of ConstraintsSpecialty Chemical NetworkView Karen’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Karen directlyView Karen’s Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishGermanChinese (Simplified)People Also ViewedLarry EastVice President - Corporate Engineering at Albemarle CorporationTerry HammonsMichael WilsonPresident and Chief Executive Officer at IngevitySusan ShepherdVice President, Human Resources - People and Development, Albemarle CorporationChris YandellVice President of Manufacturing - Lithium at Albemarle CorporationJim LaBauveVice President - Corporate Controller, CAO at Albemarle CorporationCatharine de LacyGlobal Public Affairs, Product Stewardship, EHS Compliance and Sustainability Executive
