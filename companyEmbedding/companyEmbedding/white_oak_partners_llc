White Oak | A Leader In MultiFamily Real Estate Investment Opportunities



































 




A Leader in multifamily Real Estate
Investment opportunities





















Who We Are | White Oak




































 







Who We Are 

White Oak Partners is an experienced and market leading sponsor of multifamily real estate investment funds. White Oak is led by a seasoned team of multifamily real estate investment professionals with broad national expertise. We acquire and reposition existing apartment communities, and then intensely manage these assets to maximize rent and NOI growth. White Oak is currently focusing on value added and workforce housing opportunities for “A–” through “C+” multifamily assets in strong markets characterized by positive job and wage growth, a diverse economy and a balanced supply of new construction.
Our leadership team averages over 25 years in the multifamily industry and has previously acquired and managed over $14 billion in multifamily real estate, totaling over 140,000 multifamily units in 47 states. We apply that unsurpassed experience and deep understanding of local communities to identify targeted investment opportunities in a number of strong apartment markets. White Oak then seeks the optimum balance of risk and reward in selecting investments for our partners, with a sharp focus on preserving capital and producing current cash from our investments. We have real world boots on the ground investment and operating experience, breadth of knowledge in multiple markets, extensive industry contacts, and a history of working with sophisticated institutional investors. This considerable skill set allows us to provide significant investment opportunities in a number of markets across the country. We also co-invest in every asset and believe in pay-for-performance, as our compensation is heavily weighted to the results we achieve for our investor partners.
White Oak has a subsidiary that is a Registered Investment Advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
What sets our real estate investment firm apart from the rest?
We are experienced…

We have extraordinary access to the national multifamily marketplace, where we have developed a deep and broad network of relationships and contacts.
Our leadership group has proven success in establishing, growing and managing a real estate investment firm with the knowledge and experience to meet the expectations of sophisticated capital.
Our team has seasoned experts in all facets of our core business, including market research, acquisitions, project financing, operations, asset management and sales of assets.
Our team includes members whose unique expertise in fields such as architecture and large-scale project repositioning enable a comprehensive and unique capability not often found in a single organization.

We are flexible…

The White Oak team possesses a resourcefulness that springs from decades of managing large portfolios in multiple markets. This enables us to discern and recognize patterns and opportunities that might be overlooked, and to also effectively mitigate the risks inherent in real estate investments.
White Oak is committed to listening to and working with our investment partners on an ongoing basis and not locking in assumptions that yesterday’s objectives apply today.

We are continuously evolving…
We utilize sophisticated market analytics combined with time spent in the market to continually review and rank multiple markets across the U.S., identifying trends in housing preferences and tracking demographics, business climate changes and labor force migration to find the optimal investment opportunities.





What We Do White Oak Partners was formed with the goal of maximizing capital and recommending real estate investment strategies that balance risk and reward.
