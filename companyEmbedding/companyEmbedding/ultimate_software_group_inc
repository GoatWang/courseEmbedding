Take the video tour

 
Explore our beautifully simple (yet thoughtfully powerful) tools that automate operational HR tasks so you can get to the strategic activities and outcomes—like engagement, retention, and job satisfaction—that make a big impact.




Applicant Tracking System (ATS)





Find the right people faster
Just like the bird and its worm, the early HR rep gets the (best) candidate. BambooHR's applicant tracking software helps you keep up with a competitive job market and improve candidate experiences. Post to job boards, easily filter and rate candidates, and leave comments for collaborators.
Learn more





Employee Self-Onboarding




Create better first days
When employees have a stellar first day, you increase retention and engagement. BambooHR's employee self-onboarding software can help you complete paperwork before the new hire's start date and get everyone introduced quickly with welcome emails and team introductions. Goodbye boring, hello brilliant.
Learn more








Time-Off Tracking





Spend less time on time off
Be done with time-off requests in emails and on sticky notes. BambooHR handles requests and approvals digitally, then tracks them in convenient calendars and reports. You’ll love being able to create custom time-off policies that accrue automatically, and employees will love using the mobile app to submit requests.
Learn more





Employee Database and Records




Master employee data
Healthcare data for compliance? Check. Contact information for the employee directory? Check. Custom data for everyone’s shirt size and favorite candy bar? Check. Track all employee information accurately in one secure HR database that’s accessible from anywhere.
Learn more








Performance Management Software





Performance reviews reinvented
Performance reviews are broken. At least, they were. We fixed a few things like huge time commitments, weak results, and infrequency. Then we added meaningful feedback and better ways to measure performance and engagement. The result? Innovative (dare we say, enjoyable?) employee performance management.
Learn more





HR Reporting




Gain instant HR insights
Quick. Custom. Precise. BambooHR makes it easy to create detailed reports on almost any data in the system. Be proactive instead of reactive. Analyze data instead of compiling it. Be the strategic HR professional you were meant to be.
Learn more








Custom Workflows





Put bottlenecks in the guillotine
Create custom workflows to be more efficient in your decision-making processes and protect the integrity of your data. Remove bottlenecks by making approvals easy to manage and even easier to execute, paving the way for your company to grow faster.
Learn more





Electronic Signatures




Save time, money, and trees
Remove the hassle of collecting signed paperwork. Electronic signatures streamline processes, making experiences like onboarding and open enrollment more enjoyable while also keeping documents organized and easy to access. Save time by rounding up paperwork, money by ditching filing cabinets, and trees by leaving them alone.
Learn more








Bamboo Payroll





Payroll with Purpose
HR provides an experience for every single employee in the company.  Perhaps the most vital experience of all is payroll. If that experience is complicated, unreliable, or overly time-consuming, it affects more than just your bottom line. Bamboo Payroll™ takes that lesson to heart by creating a positive experience for everyone involved.

Enough said? It's time to try it.
There's no substitute for hands-on experience. Try it yourself—free software trial for seven days.

We'll organize the mess.
Give us your chaos, your mess, your disaster. We’ll clean it up and organize a spreadsheet-free life for you.









It starts with implementation.
Our HR Project Managers will take your company data and spreadsheets, migrate them into the BambooHR system, and have you up and running in no time.
Learn more here




x





Import employee data
					First, we import all of your employees’ personal information, compensation data, job information and employment status, then expand it to include benefits, trainings, licensing, emergency contacts and dependents.
				

Customize the system
					Next, we help you set up customized email alerts, new-hire and termination checklists, tables, and fields.  We’ll then configure leave types and policies, assign policies to employees, and import balances.				

Roll it out to the company
					We’ll even help you roll the system out to your company, including giving your employees self-service access so they can update their personal information, request time off and more. Need custom permissions? We’ll help you do that too!
				

Try it FREE











Next comes education.
Don’t worry. We won’t just import everything and walk away. We take you through the system and offer different types of training to ensure you know it inside and out.
Learn more here







x


Videos and webinars
At last count, we had a few dozen free videos and tutorials to help you learn the system. Some of the topics include: Getting Started, Time off Requests and Approvals, Understanding Files and Documents, and Configuring Permission Groups.  Just log into our help section.


Customized training
You can also purchase custom training sessions and in-depth webinars to train your team—or entire company—on specific features in the BambooHR system. We’ll help you with whatever it takes to make your transition easy.






Followed by unsurpassed support.
We’ve got your back.  Our support team is a phone call away and our knowledge base has a wealth of free information, including videos, articles and integration help.


Video and Articles
Watch a video tutorial. Log in to a pre-recorded webinar. Read a how-to article.  With hundreds of articles and videos, we’ve made it easy to get the answers you need.


Bamboo Community
Have a question? Someone else may have had the same one, too. Our Bamboo Community is a great resource for answers.


Integration Help
This is the go-to place for information on integrating our partner applications.








"BambooHR has become the central information hub of our company."
- Caroline Kim, HR Manager, Stacy and Witbeck

Year-Round Alaskan Resort Uses Ultimate Software's Ultipro to Reduce Costs, Improve People Operations
May 15 17
Ultimate Software announced that Alyeska Resort, Alaska's premier year-round destination, is using UltiPro to enhance strategic planning and enable managers and HR to offer greater business value. Alyeska Resort's proximity to Anchorage provides travelers with easy access to the destination's summer and winter events, such as skiing, meetings, and weddings. Prior to UltiPro, the company was using separate systems for payroll and timekeeping, which were inaccessible to anyone outside accounting and payroll. Alyeska sought a comprehensive HCM solution that would enable managers to analyze and better understand seasonal labor patterns and control costs, and to improve people operations with role-based access for supervisors. Alyeska selected UltiPro and went live in May 2014. Alyeska is taking advantage of UltiPro's Business Intelligence Knowledge Exchange to extend their reporting capabilities for strategic planning. This forum allows UltiPro users from anywhere in the world to share the innovative reports they have created. Alyeska is taking advantage of this knowledge sharing program to enhance their reports related to time management and compliance. Hawes reports that Alyeska is not only using UltiPro's flexibility to enhance reporting, but also to substantially reduce managers administrative tasks.

        No one really enjoys firing an employee. It's a tough decision for any employer-who has invested time, money, and a great deal of energy-to let a person go and move on. But even if it's not easy, it's sometimes necessary.
      

        I offer, then, a few pieces of advice to consider when firing an employee.
      

Employee Resentment[Attachment]


        Have you ever been the employee working diligently on a project, only to grow frustrated because your colleague isn't pulling their weight? Ever see another employee engage in activities that hinder workplace productivity? We likely all have. In each of those situations, firing an employee might be the best option to ensure engagement and morale among your other employees remains positive.
      

        Allowing misbehavers and poor performers to stay ignores accountability and everyone else. Other employees deserve everyone to be held to an equal, fair standard. Ignoring a problem because you're afraid to let someone go is a mistake. It's important to address a situation as soon as possible, whether through dismissal, a lateral move, or another effective action that resolves the issue.
      

The Opportunity to Resign


        Sometimes, employers like to give employees the opportunity to resign, so the employee can say they resigned rather than being terminated. While this is empathetic of the employer, I see two flaws in doing this. For one, it's not the truth. Employees (and employers, for that matter) should be held accountable for their actions.
      

        Second, letting an individual resign might actually work against the now-former employee. If an employee resigns, they may be ineligible to collect unemployment or training support from unemployment agencies. I'm a big proponent of giving people the opportunity to receive unemployment when they can.
      

Mid-Week Terminations


        Is there an 'ideal' day to fire someone? I believe it's Wednesday.
      

        When you fire an employee on a Friday, the remaining team goes home for the weekend concerned about their jobs. They might be concerned about how they fit in at the company, or their own job security. You may have terminated a popular employee, who they will miss. The adjustment is unsettling. Dismiss someone on Monday, and those worries could impact morale for entire week (or longer).
      

        If you act on a Wednesday, however, there are two more days for the team to ask you questions and get reassurance. By the following Monday, things have most likely settled down, and the dismissal has probably become a distant memory for many.
      

        Dismissing an employee isn't fun. But, on occasion, you have to do it. So, consider this advice when you have to take action. Because ignoring the situation will likely lead to bigger problems-and that's not good for anyone.

Ultimate Software is committed to equal employment opportunity and does not discriminate with regard to the terms or conditions of employment on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, national origin, military service, or disability (provided employee is physically/mentally able to perform the regular duties of his/her job). 
We have been named the #1 Workplace for Hispanics and Latinos by FORTUNE, and as one of the Best Workplaces for African-Americans. As of August 2016, Hispanics and African-Americans comprise 30 percent of our overall employee population, compared with about 10 percent at four of the largest FORTUNE 500 technology companies. Moreover, 20 percent are members of Ultimate’s leadership team (manager or above), compared with an average of about six percent at four of the largest FORTUNE 500 companies in tech. 
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST 
Military Veterans at Ultimate (UltiVets) 
UltiVets is a community of interest for military veterans at Ultimate, their friends and families, and for fellow UltiPeeps to express their appreciation for the service of our nation’s veterans. Ultimate proudly hires veterans from every military branch to contribute in all areas of the organization. We are 100 UltiVets strong and growing! Their service to our country gives us an incredible sense of pride, and the leadership and expertise our UltiVets hold in their respective fields helps make Ultimate stronger.
PRIDE US 
Ultimate’s first Community of Interest, PRIDE US, was founded in May of 2014 for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning,     intersex and ally (LGBTQIA) team members. Our mission is for our LGBTQIA UltiPeeps to feel safe, welcome, and comfortable bringing their whole selves to work while volunteering to help make the world a better place for everyone. The PRIDE US community of interest is a great resource of information as well as support to anyone who is having difficulty coming out, are parents, family members of LGBTQI and need someone to talk to or just want to make a difference in creating equality for everyone and support fellow UltiPeeps.
Women in Leadership 
Our second Community of Interest is for UltiWomen at all levels of the organization. The Women in Leadership community is dedicated to helping women achieve their maximum potential and allows them to discuss their goals, ask questions, and collaborate with one another on how they can positively impact future female leaders at work, at school, and in the community. In 2016, Ultimate was named one of FORTUNE’s Best Workplaces for Women. As of August 2016, UltiWomen comprise 49 percent of our total workforce, and 42 percent hold leadership positions (manager or above) at Ultimate.

In 2002, UltiPro was reintroduced as a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to provide a unified solution to human resources.[8] This model has allowed the company to hold more than 33 million client records in the cloud and service more than 3,400 customers, according to Career Builder. The company announced they were expanding outside of the United States and opened an office in London, England. Later that year, Ultimate announced additional expansions into Singapore. [9]

The study explored how millennials differ from prior generations in the way they feel about applying for a job, interviewing, receiving feedback, and leaving a job.[11]
In 2016, the Center for Generational Kinetics continued their partnership to examine the drivers and motivators behind the people in our workforce. The study focused on how organizations can understand and improve the employee experience.[12]

History[edit]
Ultimate Software was founded by Scott Scherr, the company’s current CEO and president in 1990. In 1993, the tech company released UltiPro HRMS/ payroll sold as on-premises software servicing core HR and payroll.[6] The company went public (NASDAQ: ULTI) in June 1998.[7]
In 2002, UltiPro was reintroduced as a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to provide a unified solution to human resources.[8] This model has allowed the company to hold more than 33 million client records in the cloud and service more than 3,400 customers, according to Career Builder. The company announced they were expanding outside of the United States and opened an office in London, England. Later that year, Ultimate announced additional expansions into Singapore. [9]
Products and services[edit]
The company's UltiPro solution is a cloud-based platform that delivers human capital management to organizations across all industries. UltiPro provides one system of record for HR, payroll, and talent management. According to SoftwareAdvice, UltiPro now includes time and attendance, employee onboarding, performance management, compensation management, succession management, recruiting, and other features like predictive analytics.[10] UltiPro is sold SaaS with a per-employee-per-month subscription.
Partnering Research[edit]
According to the Center for Generational Kinetics, the center partnered with the company in 2014 to conduct research on multiple generations in the workforce. The research looked at work expectations across different generations, with a focus on millennials.[11]
The study explored how millennials differ from prior generations in the way they feel about applying for a job, interviewing, receiving feedback, and leaving a job.[11]
In 2016, the Center for Generational Kinetics continued their partnership to examine the drivers and motivators behind the people in our workforce. The study focused on how organizations can understand and improve the employee experience.[12]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, FORTUNE Magazine ranked Ultimate Software the #7 Best Place to Work For as well as the #1 Best Workplace in Technology.[13] In prior years, FORTUNE ranked Ultimate Software the 6th Best Workplace for Millennials,[14] the 23rd Great Workplace for Women,[15] and the 21st Best Company to Work For.[16] Additionally, Forbes ranked the company the 7th Most Innovative Growth Company[17] and analyst firm, Nucleus Research, deemed the tech company a "Leader" in HCM technology.[18] In the past, Ultimate earned the 2011 Forrester Groundswell Award for achieving business and organizational goals through innovation in social technology applications[19] and the 2013 Brandon Hall Gold Award for the Best New Product Feature of the Year.[20]

Take the video tour

 
Explore our beautifully simple (yet thoughtfully powerful) tools that automate operational HR tasks so you can get to the strategic activities and outcomes—like engagement, retention, and job satisfaction—that make a big impact.




Applicant Tracking System (ATS)





Find the right people faster
Just like the bird and its worm, the early HR rep gets the (best) candidate. BambooHR's applicant tracking software helps you keep up with a competitive job market and improve candidate experiences. Post to job boards, easily filter and rate candidates, and leave comments for collaborators.
Learn more





Employee Self-Onboarding




Create better first days
When employees have a stellar first day, you increase retention and engagement. BambooHR's employee self-onboarding software can help you complete paperwork before the new hire's start date and get everyone introduced quickly with welcome emails and team introductions. Goodbye boring, hello brilliant.
Learn more








Time-Off Tracking





Spend less time on time off
Be done with time-off requests in emails and on sticky notes. BambooHR handles requests and approvals digitally, then tracks them in convenient calendars and reports. You’ll love being able to create custom time-off policies that accrue automatically, and employees will love using the mobile app to submit requests.
Learn more





Employee Database and Records




Master employee data
Healthcare data for compliance? Check. Contact information for the employee directory? Check. Custom data for everyone’s shirt size and favorite candy bar? Check. Track all employee information accurately in one secure HR database that’s accessible from anywhere.
Learn more








Performance Management Software





Performance reviews reinvented
Performance reviews are broken. At least, they were. We fixed a few things like huge time commitments, weak results, and infrequency. Then we added meaningful feedback and better ways to measure performance and engagement. The result? Innovative (dare we say, enjoyable?) employee performance management.
Learn more





HR Reporting




Gain instant HR insights
Quick. Custom. Precise. BambooHR makes it easy to create detailed reports on almost any data in the system. Be proactive instead of reactive. Analyze data instead of compiling it. Be the strategic HR professional you were meant to be.
Learn more








Custom Workflows





Put bottlenecks in the guillotine
Create custom workflows to be more efficient in your decision-making processes and protect the integrity of your data. Remove bottlenecks by making approvals easy to manage and even easier to execute, paving the way for your company to grow faster.
Learn more





Electronic Signatures




Save time, money, and trees
Remove the hassle of collecting signed paperwork. Electronic signatures streamline processes, making experiences like onboarding and open enrollment more enjoyable while also keeping documents organized and easy to access. Save time by rounding up paperwork, money by ditching filing cabinets, and trees by leaving them alone.
Learn more








Bamboo Payroll





Payroll with Purpose
HR provides an experience for every single employee in the company.  Perhaps the most vital experience of all is payroll. If that experience is complicated, unreliable, or overly time-consuming, it affects more than just your bottom line. Bamboo Payroll™ takes that lesson to heart by creating a positive experience for everyone involved.

We'll organize the mess.
Give us your chaos, your mess, your disaster. We’ll clean it up and organize a spreadsheet-free life for you.









It starts with implementation.
Our HR Project Managers will take your company data and spreadsheets, migrate them into the BambooHR system, and have you up and running in no time.
Learn more here




x





Import employee data
					First, we import all of your employees’ personal information, compensation data, job information and employment status, then expand it to include benefits, trainings, licensing, emergency contacts and dependents.
				

Customize the system
					Next, we help you set up customized email alerts, new-hire and termination checklists, tables, and fields.  We’ll then configure leave types and policies, assign policies to employees, and import balances.				

Roll it out to the company
					We’ll even help you roll the system out to your company, including giving your employees self-service access so they can update their personal information, request time off and more. Need custom permissions? We’ll help you do that too!
				

Try it FREE











Next comes education.
Don’t worry. We won’t just import everything and walk away. We take you through the system and offer different types of training to ensure you know it inside and out.

Videos and webinars
At last count, we had a few dozen free videos and tutorials to help you learn the system. Some of the topics include: Getting Started, Time off Requests and Approvals, Understanding Files and Documents, and Configuring Permission Groups.  Just log into our help section.


Customized training
You can also purchase custom training sessions and in-depth webinars to train your team—or entire company—on specific features in the BambooHR system. We’ll help you with whatever it takes to make your transition easy.






Followed by unsurpassed support.
We’ve got your back.  Our support team is a phone call away and our knowledge base has a wealth of free information, including videos, articles and integration help.


Video and Articles
Watch a video tutorial. Log in to a pre-recorded webinar. Read a how-to article.  With hundreds of articles and videos, we’ve made it easy to get the answers you need.


Bamboo Community
Have a question? Someone else may have had the same one, too. Our Bamboo Community is a great resource for answers.


Integration Help

History[edit]
Ultimate Software was founded by Scott Scherr, the company’s current CEO and president in 1990. In 1993, the tech company released UltiPro HRMS/ payroll sold as on-premises software servicing core HR and payroll.[6] The company went public (NASDAQ: ULTI) in June 1998.[7]
In 2002, UltiPro was reintroduced as a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to provide a unified solution to human resources.[8] This model has allowed the company to hold more than 33 million client records in the cloud and service more than 3,400 customers, according to Career Builder. The company announced they were expanding outside of the United States and opened an office in London, England. Later that year, Ultimate announced additional expansions into Singapore. [9]
Products and services[edit]
The company's UltiPro solution is a cloud-based platform that delivers human capital management to organizations across all industries. UltiPro provides one system of record for HR, payroll, and talent management. According to SoftwareAdvice, UltiPro now includes time and attendance, employee onboarding, performance management, compensation management, succession management, recruiting, and other features like predictive analytics.[10] UltiPro is sold SaaS with a per-employee-per-month subscription.
Partnering Research[edit]
According to the Center for Generational Kinetics, the center partnered with the company in 2014 to conduct research on multiple generations in the workforce. The research looked at work expectations across different generations, with a focus on millennials.[11]
The study explored how millennials differ from prior generations in the way they feel about applying for a job, interviewing, receiving feedback, and leaving a job.[11]
In 2016, the Center for Generational Kinetics continued their partnership to examine the drivers and motivators behind the people in our workforce. The study focused on how organizations can understand and improve the employee experience.[12]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, FORTUNE Magazine ranked Ultimate Software the #7 Best Place to Work For as well as the #1 Best Workplace in Technology.[13] In prior years, FORTUNE ranked Ultimate Software the 6th Best Workplace for Millennials,[14] the 23rd Great Workplace for Women,[15] and the 21st Best Company to Work For.[16] Additionally, Forbes ranked the company the 7th Most Innovative Growth Company[17] and analyst firm, Nucleus Research, deemed the tech company a "Leader" in HCM technology.[18] In the past, Ultimate earned the 2011 Forrester Groundswell Award for achieving business and organizational goals through innovation in social technology applications[19] and the 2013 Brandon Hall Gold Award for the Best New Product Feature of the Year.[20]

History[edit]
Ultimate Software was founded by Scott Scherr, the company’s current CEO and president in 1990. In 1993, the tech company released UltiPro HRMS/ payroll sold as on-premises software servicing core HR and payroll.[6] The company went public (NASDAQ: ULTI) in June 1998.[7]
In 2002, UltiPro was reintroduced as a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to provide a unified solution to human resources.[8] This model has allowed the company to hold more than 33 million client records in the cloud and service more than 3,400 customers, according to Career Builder. The company announced they were expanding outside of the United States and opened an office in London, England. Later that year, Ultimate announced additional expansions into Singapore. [9]
Products and services[edit]
The company's UltiPro solution is a cloud-based platform that delivers human capital management to organizations across all industries. UltiPro provides one system of record for HR, payroll, and talent management. According to SoftwareAdvice, UltiPro now includes time and attendance, employee onboarding, performance management, compensation management, succession management, recruiting, and other features like predictive analytics.[10] UltiPro is sold SaaS with a per-employee-per-month subscription.
Partnering Research[edit]
According to the Center for Generational Kinetics, the center partnered with the company in 2014 to conduct research on multiple generations in the workforce. The research looked at work expectations across different generations, with a focus on millennials.[11]
The study explored how millennials differ from prior generations in the way they feel about applying for a job, interviewing, receiving feedback, and leaving a job.[11]
In 2016, the Center for Generational Kinetics continued their partnership to examine the drivers and motivators behind the people in our workforce. The study focused on how organizations can understand and improve the employee experience.[12]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, FORTUNE Magazine ranked Ultimate Software the #7 Best Place to Work For as well as the #1 Best Workplace in Technology.[13] In prior years, FORTUNE ranked Ultimate Software the 6th Best Workplace for Millennials,[14] the 23rd Great Workplace for Women,[15] and the 21st Best Company to Work For.[16] Additionally, Forbes ranked the company the 7th Most Innovative Growth Company[17] and analyst firm, Nucleus Research, deemed the tech company a "Leader" in HCM technology.[18] In the past, Ultimate earned the 2011 Forrester Groundswell Award for achieving business and organizational goals through innovation in social technology applications[19] and the 2013 Brandon Hall Gold Award for the Best New Product Feature of the Year.[20]

History[edit]
Ultimate Software was founded by Scott Scherr, the company’s current CEO and president in 1990. In 1993, the tech company released UltiPro HRMS/ payroll sold as on-premises software servicing core HR and payroll.[6] The company went public (NASDAQ: ULTI) in June 1998.[7]
In 2002, UltiPro was reintroduced as a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to provide a unified solution to human resources.[8] This model has allowed the company to hold more than 33 million client records in the cloud and service more than 3,400 customers, according to Career Builder. The company announced they were expanding outside of the United States and opened an office in London, England. Later that year, Ultimate announced additional expansions into Singapore. [9]
Products and services[edit]
The company's UltiPro solution is a cloud-based platform that delivers human capital management to organizations across all industries. UltiPro provides one system of record for HR, payroll, and talent management. According to SoftwareAdvice, UltiPro now includes time and attendance, employee onboarding, performance management, compensation management, succession management, recruiting, and other features like predictive analytics.[10] UltiPro is sold SaaS with a per-employee-per-month subscription.
Partnering Research[edit]
According to the Center for Generational Kinetics, the center partnered with the company in 2014 to conduct research on multiple generations in the workforce. The research looked at work expectations across different generations, with a focus on millennials.[11]
The study explored how millennials differ from prior generations in the way they feel about applying for a job, interviewing, receiving feedback, and leaving a job.[11]
In 2016, the Center for Generational Kinetics continued their partnership to examine the drivers and motivators behind the people in our workforce. The study focused on how organizations can understand and improve the employee experience.[12]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, FORTUNE Magazine ranked Ultimate Software the #7 Best Place to Work For as well as the #1 Best Workplace in Technology.[13] In prior years, FORTUNE ranked Ultimate Software the 6th Best Workplace for Millennials,[14] the 23rd Great Workplace for Women,[15] and the 21st Best Company to Work For.[16] Additionally, Forbes ranked the company the 7th Most Innovative Growth Company[17] and analyst firm, Nucleus Research, deemed the tech company a "Leader" in HCM technology.[18] In the past, Ultimate earned the 2011 Forrester Groundswell Award for achieving business and organizational goals through innovation in social technology applications[19] and the 2013 Brandon Hall Gold Award for the Best New Product Feature of the Year.[20]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
