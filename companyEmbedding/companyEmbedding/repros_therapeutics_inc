Product Candidate (Indication):
Milestone(s)


Secondary Hypogonadism
Submitted NDA (Q1 2015)



Enclomiphene is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound. 
We are developing enclomiphene for men of reproductive age with low testosterone due to secondary hypogonadism. Secondary hypogonadism is associated with obesity and we believe it is among the most common causes of low testosterone in men. It is estimated that 13 million men in the U.S. experience low levels of testosterone, and the condition is becoming recognized with more frequency.  
We believe enclomiphene is highly differentiated from currently marketed testosterone treatments or those treatments in late stage development because it is an oral therapy and it treats the cause of secondary hypogonadism, which is inadequate pituitary hormones. We believe that by treating the cause of secondary hypogonadism, enclomiphene also has the potential to maintain reproductive status and potentially improve overall metabolic profiles.
In addition, the Company continues to consider the potential for use of enclomiphene as an adjuvant therapy in hypogonadal men with Type 2 diabetes.  The Company has an active IND open with the Division of Endocrine and Metabolic Products at the FDA for this indication.  We believe there may be an association between the restoration of normal pituitary function and improvement of metabolic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes. Research has been published which demonstrates that increased insulin resistance, a characteristic implicated in Type 2 diabetes, is associated with the onset of secondary hypogonadism.

Enclomiphene is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound. We are developing enclomiphene for men of reproductive age with low testosterone due to secondary hypogonadism. Secondary hypogonadism is associated with obesity and we believe it is among the most common causes of low testosterone in men. It is estimated that 13 million men in the U.S. experience low levels of testosterone, and the condition is becoming recognized with more frequency.
We believe enclomiphene is highly differentiated from currently marketed testosterone treatments or those treatments in late stage development because it is an oral therapy and it treats the cause of secondary hypogonadism, which is inadequate pituitary hormones. We believe that by treating the cause of secondary hypogonadism, enclomiphene also has the potential to maintain reproductive status and potentially improve overall metabolic profiles.
In addition, the Company continues to consider the potential for use of enclomiphene as an adjuvant therapy in hypogonadal men with Type 2 diabetes.  The Company has an active IND open with the Division of Endocrine and Metabolic Products at the FDA for this indication.  We believe there may be an association between the restoration of normal pituitary function and improvement of metabolic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes. Research has been published which demonstrates that increased insulin resistance, a characteristic implicated in Type 2 diabetes, is associated with the onset of secondary hypogonadism.
Proellex®
Female reproductive health:
Proellex is a new chemical entity that acts as a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and is being developed for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis. We are currently developing Proellex for both oral and vaginal delivery, as the FDA has accepted an Investigational New Drug Application for vaginally delivered Proellex®. There are currently no FDA-approved orally administered drug treatments for the long-term treatment of either uterine fibroids or endometriosis. The National Uterine Fibroids Foundation estimates that 80% of all women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids, and one in four of these women have symptoms severe enough to require treatment.
The current standards of care for uterine fibroids and endometriosis consist of surgery or short-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone ("GnRH") agonists drugs. GnRH agonists induce a low estrogen, menopausal-like state and promote bone loss and are not recommended for use for more than six months.
Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under our ticker symbol, RPRX.

Repros Therapeutics

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Repros Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: RPRX), is a US-based development stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. Founded in 1987 as Zonagen, it is focused on the development of oral small molecule drugs to address major unmet medical needs in male and female health. Joseph S. Podolski[1] is the CEO of this company.
History[edit]
The company was organized on August 28, 1987 as Zonagen, to try to develop birth control methods based on modification of the zona pellucida—a part of the oocyte. The company bought the rights to the research of Bonnie S. Dunbar, researcher and professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, and attempted to create a contraceptive vaccine.
Zonagen, Inc. was formed in 1987 by Dunbar, Baylor and a group of investors that included Ross Perot and Lloyd Bentsen III, son of a former treasury secretary. The company hoped to market Dunbar's invention as a nonsurgical method of sterilizing dogs and cats. In the meantime, Zonagen would help Dunbar continue the pursuit of her life's work: the world's first contraceptive vaccine for humans.
Her research, which had been progressing well, ground to a complete halt according to Brian Wallstin of the Houston Press newspaper in his article “Biological Disaster.”[2] The company, went public in 1993 with claims that a contraceptive vaccine was imminent. Bonnie Dunbar ended relations with the company and sued them. Zonagen would not develop any commercial product from research relating to the zona pellucida—despite naming itself after it.
Its next project was to create an adjuvant. These products modify the effects of the active ingredient in a drug without having any direct effects of their own. However, Zonagen's attempt, ImmuMax, was merely an attempt to patent and cash in off a widely researched generic product: a structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans. The compound, chitosan, was indeed capable of causing some desirable effects within the immune system, but it also caused permanent scarring at injection point which made it useless for the sort of medicinal purposes Zonagen hoped to use it for.
After abandoning ImmuMax, Zonagen moved on to its third drug: Vasomax a disintegrating oral formulation of phentolamine. Realizing that Pfizer's Viagra was going to be a hit product, Zonagen hoped to ride its coattails with an erectile dysfunction drug of its own. However, unlike Pfizer, Zonagen repeated its experience from ImmuMax; it got a forty-year-old generic drug, phentolamine, dressed it up as something new, and acted as if it was a genuine Viagra competitor. While phentolamine was never proven to create erections by itself, Zonagen claimed that its formulation, simply phentolamine administered orally instead of in pill form, would work. Despite a failed Phase II trial in 1996 for Vasomax, the company proceeded to Phase III trials anyway. Once Schering-Plough pulled out of its partnership with Zonagen for Vasomax, Zonagen abandoned its New Drug Application for Vasomax. The company was left with little more than a corporate shell and a bunch of lawsuits.
Joseph S. Podolski served as Chief Executive Officer and as a director since 1992. He joined Zonagen in 1989 as Vice President of Operations. Previously, Podolski spent twelve years in various engineering, product development and manufacturing positions at G.D. Searle, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company. Before joining Monsanto, Podolski held positions in manufacturing, engineering, quality control and development of fine chemicals, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and hospital products with Abbott Laboratories, Dearborn Chemical Company and Baxter Pharmaceuticals. Joseph S. Podolski,[1] the man who led Zonagen through two decades, decided it was time for a name change. In 2006, Zonagen changed its name to Repros Therapeutics, started to develop other pharmaceutical products for the reproductive system, and began work on its fourth lead drug, Proellex. Proellex is a very similar drug to asoprisnil. Asoprisnil was developed by Germany-based Schering AG to treat endometriosis. Development was discontinued because the drug was causing thickening of the endometrium. Repros claimed that its time on the drug/off the drug approach will make a big difference in safety versus asoprisnil. Currently, products under clinical trial are Proellex and Androxal. None have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of mid-2010. Androxal consists of an isomer of Clomifene, which is already being used as a generic treatment for male hypogonadism.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
