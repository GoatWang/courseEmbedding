Alcoa Names Sigurdsson President, European Region and Global Primary
    Products Europe





















 








					The Largest Independent Automotive Research Resource
				
























































		Alcoa Names Sigurdsson President, European Region and Global Primary
    Products Europe	



NEW YORK--December 27, 2011: Alcoa
announced today that Tómas Már Sigurdsson, Managing 
      Director Alcoa Fjardaál, is appointed President, European Region and

      Alcoa Global Primary Products (GPP) Europe effective January 1, 2012.

      Sigurdsson succeeds Marcos Ramos who has assumed new responsibilities
as 
      President of GPP in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Sigurdsson's 
      successor will be announced at a later date.
    
“As a fully integrated aluminum company in Europe,
representing and 
      coordinating Alcoa's wide array of Primary, Rolling and
downstream 
      businesses is an important role. Tomas is the ideal leader to take on

      that vital task”

      As European Regional President, Sigurdsson will be responsible for 
      coordinating the activities of all of Alcoa's nearly 50
locations 
      throughout Europe, reporting to Chris Ayers, Alcoa Executive Vice 
      President and President, Alcoa Global Primary Products, who is 
      overseeing Europe as a member of Alcoa's Executive
Council. In his role 
      as head of GPP Europe, Sigurdsson will report to GPP Chief Operating 
      Officer Bill Oplinger and will have direct accountability for
Alcoa's 
      smelters and refinery in Iceland, Italy, Norway and Spain.
    

      "As a fully integrated aluminum company in Europe,
representing and 
      coordinating Alcoa's wide array of Primary, Rolling and
downstream 
      businesses is an important role. Tomas is the ideal leader to take on

      that vital task," said Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa Chairman and
CEO.
    

      "Tómas brings to our European Primary business solid
operational 
      experience having been responsible for the start-up and current
ongoing 
      operations of the Fjardaál smelting facility in Reydarfjordur,
Iceland -- 
      the largest and newest smelter in the Alcoa system," said
Ayers. "He has 
      driven improvement across the operation and proved to be a vital
force 
      in the community."
    

      Sigurdsson joined Alcoa in March 2004 from Nordurál, a primary
aluminum 
      manufacturer in Iceland, where he held various management positions 
      since 1997. Early in his career he was an engineer/project manager
for 
      Hönnun Ltd. Consulting Engineers and the Icelandic Public Road 
      Administration. A graduate of the University of Iceland, ReykjavÃ­k, 
      Sigurdsson has a bachelor's degree in Civil and
Environmental 
      Engineering and a master's degree in Development
Planning in 1995 from 
      Cornell University, in the United States.

      Alcoa innovation has been behind major milestones in the aerospace,

      past 120 years. Among the solutions Alcoa markets are flat-rolled
