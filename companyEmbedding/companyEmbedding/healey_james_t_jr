If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

James T. Healey


1929 - 2014
Obituary
Condolences

































 Attorney James T. Healey of West Hartford died on April 27, 2014. Born in New Haven, November 2, 1929, he grew up in Orange, the son of the late William F. and Helen C. Healey. He was a graduate of Choate '47, Yale College '51, and Yale Law School '54. Following law school, he clerked for U.S. District Court Judge J. Joseph Smith, and was in private practice for 22 years in Hartford specializing in civil litigation. He later joined the law department of the United Technologies Corporation. He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Louise (Toole), and his children (and their spouses): Christine Healey (Ryan Brown) of Washington, D.C.; Carolyn Caldwell of Old Lyme; Alicia Healey of West Hartford; James T. Healey, Jr., (Pamela Dowling) of West Hartford and Madison; Brenda Bosch (William Bosch) of Great Falls, VA; and Helen Rice (Mark Rice) of Rye, NY. He is also survived by his 13 grandchildren, grandson-in-law, and great-granddaughter: Nate Brown, Gabe Brown, Catherine Caldwell Velez (Mike Velez), Maddie Velez, Danielle Caldwell, Jack Caldwell, Emily Mowel, James Dowling-Healey, Allison Bosch, Margaret Bosch, Caroline Bosch, Melissa Rice, Peter Rice and Kendall Rice; as well as by his brother John C. Healey and his brothers-in-law Edward, Allan and David Toole. He was predeceased by his son-in-law John M. Caldwell, his brother William F. Healey, Jr., and his sister Helen H. Curran. In 2001, Mr. Healey was elected to the Connecticut State Golf Hall of Fame. He had won the 1947 CSGA Junior Championship, the 1951 and 1958 CSGA Amateur Championships, and five CSGA Four Ball titles from 1951 to 1962. In 1951 and 1965 he was a semifinalist in the New England Amateur Championship and twice advanced to match play in the USGA Amateur Championship. He captained the Yale Golf Team in 1951. He was a past member at Race Brook Country Club (winning the club championship twice), Winged Foot, and the Course at Yale, and was a 59-year member of the Hartford Golf Club, winning the club championship seven times. Mr. Healey was a communicant of St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church in Hartford, a corporator of St. Francis Hospital, and past board member of the Hartford Golf Club. He served on the CSGA Executive Committee from 1963-1983, was president of the New England Golf Association from 1976-1978, and was a director of the Junior Golf Association of Connecticut from 1976-1980. Calling hours are Friday, May 2, from 4-7 p.m. at Molloy Funeral Home, 906 Farmington Ave. West Hartford. A Mass in remembrance will be said on Saturday, May 3, at 1:30 p.m. at St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church, 285 Church Street, Hartford. Burial will be private. For those wishing to honor Mr. Healey, donations to the Brain Injury Alliance of Connecticut (www.biact.org) or the Elizabeth Park Conservancy (elizabethparkct.org) would be appreciated.
