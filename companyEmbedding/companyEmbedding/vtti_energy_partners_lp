Our Terminals









Network and regions

In order to serve the world’s energy flows, VTTI Energy Partners brings together market-driven assets in strategically selected places.
Our network spans the global storage hubs that act as production, consumption, pricing and trading centres. 
Each of our locations benefits from deep water draft, excellent road, rail  and hinterland connections, advanced infrastructure and favourable regulations that facilitate trading.

HUB 1: ARA (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp)



The ARA region is a key international supply and demand hub that serves ten refineries with a total refining capacity of three million barrels per day. With the region’s shortage of diesel fuel, and an excess of gasoline and fuel oil, balancing supply and demand requires significant levels of imports and exports.

We expect this trend to continue, with the diesel deficit requiring imports from Russian, Indian, Arabian Gulf and U.S. refiners. This augurs well for VTTI Energy Partners, the only company with terminals to service diesel fuel in all three ARA ports.

HUB 2: Middle East



The Middle East region continues to be one of the world’s largest crude oil producers exporters. It also has significant refining capacity, but like Europe it has shortages and excesses of certain products.
The Port of Fujairah is one of the Emirates’ most important facilities and plays a key role in balancing the supply and demand in the region.

It is located approximately 70 nautical miles from the Straits of Hormuz, and is a gateway to the Indian Ocean from the Persian Gulf. In addition to its close access to the Middle East, it also serves as an outlet to East Africa and South Asia and as a consolidation point for fuel oil outlets and the regional bunker markets.

HUB 3: Asia



Within the Asian region, Singapore is a regional hub comprising three world class refineries, seven independent oil terminals, five chemical plants and a multitude of floating storage vessels.
By some measure, it is the world's largest bunker market and is the location where surpluses from Korea and Taiwan are matched with growing deficits in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Australia.

Within the region, we expect significant development of refining capacity in countries such as China, but reductions in countries such as Japan and Australia. As a result, we expect that the region as a whole may be balanced in supply and demand, but that intraregional trade will increase.

HUB 4: North America



In North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast is the supply and demand hub that serves the region. The surge in shale oil production over the past five years, combined with the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, has driven a boom in refined petroleum product exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast.
The country’s petroleum refining capacity is concentrated in Texas and Louisiana, leading to a structural excess of gasoline, diesel, LPG and naphtha on the Gulf Coast.

While the Gulf Coast refineries are benefitting from access to lower cost crude oil, other states without refining capacity, including Florida, depend on imports of refined petroleum products.
Florida’s tourism industry, and the resulting traffic through its international airports and cruise harbours, means the state’s demand for transport and marine fuels is one of the highest in the United States.

VTTI Energy Partners: Our Terminals


VTTI FTLUnited Arab Emirates









A major Gulf terminal and refinery


VTTI FTL has been in the VTTI portfolio since 2007, and was significantly expanded in 2009.
Its geography is a major strength. It sits at the gateway of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, in one of the major bunker markets in the world. Its location within the port is also significant, directly adjacent to the shared user berths. This enables faster product-handling rates than at any other terminal in the port. Its berth flexibility and deep draft also mean that it can accommodate any size or type of vessel.
The facility is connected to the Fujairah Refinery Limited (FRL) refinery, which processes a combination of condensate and heavy crude oil. The refinery is able to process up to 80,000 barrels per day.
Storage Capacity. The terminal operates 47 tanks, with a total available storage capacity of 7.4 million barrels/1,180,000 m3. VTTIâs 90% ownership of the terminal therefore equates to 6.7 million barrels.
Accessibility. The terminal is accessible by any type of vessel, and has 9 berths with a maximum draft of 54 feet. The terminal also provides a direct connection to the pipelines of VHFL and GPSChemoil.
Product Scope. The terminal handles products right across the barrel, including crude oil, jet fuel, naphtha, gasoil and fuel oil.

VTTI energy partners: our terminals


Health, Safety & Environment









HSE EXCELLENCE. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT AIM WE HAVE.


VTTI has been built on an ethos of adopting non-negotiable safety standards. At VTTI Energy Partners LP, we build on this ethos.
There is no higher priority than the well-being of people and the environments in which we operate. To this end we have a health, safety and environment (HSE) Policy, with a clear and uniform set of standards that applies to all of our terminal facilities worldwide.
In turn, this translates into a better service to our customers. Safe, well-run terminals are efficienct at their core.




HSE Policy

Our VTTI HSE Policy is a statement of intent:
a set of beliefs, standards and actions aimed at achieving world-class levels of personal and environmental safety.



We view any accident and incident as unacceptable.
We comply with all applicable local regulations as a minimum.
We set uniform VTTI standards at every terminal, which are in some cases higher than local regulations.
We work to the VTTI Integrated HSE Management Manual which includes both performance management and root cause analysis.



We design and provide training and support which results in every terminal being operated by qualified personnel.
We invest in infrastructure with the aim of avoiding harm to people and our environments, both inside and outside our terminals.
We promote good HSE practice as a fundamental part of employment on our sites; it is everyone’s responsibility.
We continuously measure our HSE performance.











Safety: measuring our progress



We subscribe to the belief that only things that get measured get improved.
Our own safety record has shown consistent improvement since 2006 but this is never allowed to give rise to complacency. No terminal can ever be ‘too safe’.
We actively track safety through monthly reporting of any injuries (the Total Injury Rate, or ‘TIR’). This is communicated to the whole company every month.
However, the TIR only shines a light on the past. In addition, we adopt pro-active Safety Observation Rounds, encouraging discussion and learning as our people go about their roles each day.

We also positively encourage blame-free ‘near-miss’ reporting, to make sure that any incident is logged, studied and acted upon.







Respecting and protecting the environment



VTTI Energy Partners LP operates in heavy industry, and also handles products which have the potential to be hazardous to people and the environment.
Each country has its own legislation on environmental performance and in recent years licence requirements have become increasingly stringent. We are committed to comply with all environmental regulations.

In particular, our investment and focus are centred on three areas:

Vapour treatment. Deploying dedicated technologies to control vapours and odours that pose hazards or a nuisance to our local communities.
Wastewater treatment. We have invested heavily in wastewater treatment technologies to ensure discharges into the environment comply with all local laws.
Soil protection & remediation. We have recognised and are addressing the need for long-term soil remediation and protection plans for our older terminals in Amsterdam and Antwerp. Again, we are committed to comply with all local environmental regulations as a minimum.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About Us
VTTI Energy Partners


From capacity



to capital.











Generating stable and predictable cash flows

On 1 August 2014, VTTI Energy Partners began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as a master limited partnership (MLP).

The company operates as a fee-based, growth-oriented limited partnership, created to own, operate, develop and acquire energy storage terminals and related infrastructure.


It provides world-class storage services for crude oil, refined petroleum products and LPG inventories, driven by a management team with a proven track record in successfully operating and developing VTTI’s asset base.









Six terminals, four hubs

The company’s current assets comprise a portfolio of six state-of-the-art terminals spread across five continents, strategically located in the four key energy hubs of the world.


In total, VTTI Energy Partners owns 396 tanks, offering total storage capacity of 35.5 million barrels/5.6 million m3. The company is also firmly focused on growth, through a strategy that offers multiple potential sources of expansion.



These include dropdowns of additional assets from the wider VTTI group; organic development at existing assets; potential strategic greenfield development; and brownfield acquisitions in the highly fragmented international terminalling market.

The business model & objective

VTTI Energy Partners’ revenues are derived from long-term fee-based contracts, with no direct exposure to commodity price. The priority is always to operate its terminals safely, while delivering efficiency and industry-leading customer service.

The company’s primary financial objective is to generate stable and predictable cash flows that expand significantly over time, enabling it to deliver superior distribution growth to its unitholders.
