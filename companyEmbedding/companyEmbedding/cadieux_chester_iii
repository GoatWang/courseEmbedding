The QuikTrip Corporation, more commonly known as QuikTrip (QT), is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based chain of convenience stores that primarily operates in the Midwestern, Southern, and Southeastern United States.
The first QuikTrip was opened in 1958 in Tulsa by Burt Holmes and Chester Cadieux. The company expanded outside of Oklahoma in 1968, and started selling gasoline in 1971.[1] Chester's son, Chet, Jr., is the current CEO.
Since 1991, QuikTrip has promoted its gasoline as "high-quality" with an unconditional guarantee. In 2005, QuikTrip and Chevron were the first two retailers to earn a "Top Tier" rating from General Motors, BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, and Toyota. (The "Top Tier" rating exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency's standards for gasoline additives.)[2]

Overview[edit]
QuikTrip has been consistently listed among Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. The January 2006 version of the rankings placed QT at #21, ninth among companies classified as "mid-size.", for 2008 QT was ranked 27 in Fortune's top 100 list[3] QuikTrip often uses this fact in recruiting new employees. QuikTrip also ranked 33rd on Forbes magazine's list of largest private companies in 2016.[4]
History[edit]
The first QuikTrip store was opened in a Tulsa, Oklahoma strip mall in 1958, which sold a limited selection of groceries with high prices for the convenience.[5] QuikTrip began to sell gasoline in 1971 as states legalized self-service stations. In the early 1970s, co-founder Cadieux eliminated slow-moving merchandise from the stores' inventory, such as canned vegetables, and stocked a larger quantity of items, priced low for high-volume sales, such as beer, soda, coffee, cigarettes, and candy.[5]
QuikTrip had its own branded goods marketed from the 1970s-1980s, including QT Beer — QT for "Quittin' Time." The ad campaign, "It's QT Time Again," would often show a dog named Lamar. The dog's owner was portrayed in television commercials by actor Ben Jones, who often asked the dog, "Ain't that right, Lamar?"[6]
In 1988, upon rapid expansions into the St. Louis and Atlanta markets, QuikTrip began a renovation of all stores, primarily replacing the earthtone exterior and interior with a bright red color scheme. The interior decor featured red countertops and a red quarry tile floor; almond tile on the walls interspersed with painted red sections of the walls to create contrast. Some gold trim maintained continuity from the previous decor. The company also took more care with landscaping around the store.[5] By the early 1990s, QuikTrip began to offer fast foods and fountain beverages at its stores, being the first convenience store to offer a self-serve soda fountain and a self-serve coffee bar. Expensive advertising led the company to phase out the private label beer by this time.[5]
In 1994, QuikTrip acquired the former Memorex/Telex Communications headquarters in Tulsa and remodeled part of the building for its Oklahoma division. In 2003, QuikTrip decided to consolidate all employees into one corporate campus in south Tulsa and sold the building to Community Care College.[7]
In 2014, a QuikTrip store in Ferguson, Missouri was looted and subsequently burned in a riot following the fatal August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown.[8]
Products and services[edit]

In an attempt to increase speed and improve customer service at checkout, QuikTrip asks customers to stand at the counter versus standing in a long line. Employees are taught at orientation to go provide assistance on an additional register when the customer to cashier ratio exceeds 3:1, and to direct customers to the closest available checkout.[citation needed]
Since the early 1990s, QuikTrip has sold a private label brand of fast food, "Quick 'n Tasty" and "HOTZI sandwiches". "Quick 'n Tasty" heat-and-serve sandwiches include Texas Ham and Cheese, BarBQ Pork Rib, and the Super Po Boy. "HOTZI" breakfast sandwiches included the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and the breakfast burrito.[5]
In 2012, QuikTrip began an initiative of offering fresh food made daily at its own bakery and commissary referred to as QT Kitchens. The products includes fresh sandwiches, wraps, salads, fruit, and various pastries made and delivered daily.[9] Since then, QuikTrip has expanded the "QT Kitchens" brand to include actual kitchens in their stores with made-to-order hot food as well as specialty drinks.[10] The company also retrofitted their older style stores to include the new kitchen operations, in addition to building entirely new "Gen 3" stores.
Travel centers[edit]
During rapid expansion in the late 1980s, some QuikTrip stores included large 'travel centers.' A smaller version of a truck stop, the travel centers included a 5,000-square-foot store, 12 gasoline pumps, five diesel fuel pumps with elevated canopy to accommodate large trucks, a truck scale, and a store to serve the needs of truck drivers.[5]
Dual-branded stores[edit]
In 1994, QuikTrip began test-marketing a dual-brand concept in St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Atlanta, where a 3,000-square-foot Wendy's store was attached to each QuikTrip convenience store. In Des Moines, QuikTrip opened a new store with a Burger King with a separate entry and a drive-through window, but a passageway allowing movement between the convenience store and the restaurant.[5]
Non-traditional stores[edit]
In October 2007, QuikTrip opened a store within the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri.[11] The location only offered concessions and not gasoline. The store was closed in mid-2013.[12] The company's second store without gasoline—store No.1700— opened in midtown Atlanta at the Viewpoint Midtown condominium building on Peachtree Street.
In 2008, QuikTrip signed an agreement with the city of Grand Prairie, Texas for naming rights to the Grand Prairie AirHogs' new stadium, to be named QuikTrip Park. The deal included a QuikTrip booth at the stadium selling QT Kitchens products at the park for store price.[13]
Locations[edit]
QuikTrip operates 758 stores[14] which are located in the following areas of the United States:

Arizona: Phoenix metro (91 stores)
Arizona: Tucson metro (20 stores)
Georgia: Atlanta metro (133 stores)
Iowa: Des Moines metro (23 stores)
Kansas: Wichita metro (38 stores)
Kansas / Missouri: Kansas City metro (83 stores)
Missouri / Illinois: St. Louis metro (73 stores)
Nebraska / Iowa: Omaha metro (10 stores)
North and South Carolina: Charlotte metro (39 stores)
Oklahoma: Tulsa metro (77 stores)
South Carolina: Greenville / Spartanburg metro (36 stores)
Texas: Dallas / Fort Worth metro (135 stores)

All stores are owned and operated by the company.
In the Dallas/Fort Worth and Atlanta metro areas, QuikTrip competes head to head with RaceTrac, an Atlanta-based convenience store chain that is very similar to QuikTrip inside and out. Both chains tend to have new clean facilities with abundant on-site lighting and a large convenience area.[15][16] In many cases, the two competitors are located directly across the street or on opposite street corners from one another.[17]
Because the company operates stores in Iowa and holds the trademarks to the name within that state, competing chain Kwik Trip uses a different name for their stores in the state, Kwik Star
In the Phoenix metropolitan area, there are no QuikTrip stores located within the city limits of the suburb of Scottsdale. This is due to a city ordinance that regulates the design and build of gas and service stations within city limits that severely goes against the company's distinct uniform design of their stores.[citation needed] Neither the city nor the company will give in to the other, therefore Scottsdale is the only city in the Phoenix area without a QT.
The company has run into similar issues in Overland Park, Kansas, but it's more from desire to make the city more "pedestrian-friendly".. [18]

Dual-branded stores[edit]
In 1994, QuikTrip began test-marketing a dual-brand concept in St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Atlanta, where a 3,000-square-foot Wendy's store was attached to each QuikTrip convenience store. In Des Moines, QuikTrip opened a new store with a Burger King with a separate entry and a drive-through window, but a passageway allowing movement between the convenience store and the restaurant.[5]

QuikTrip operates 758 stores[14] which are located in the following areas of the United States:

Arizona: Phoenix metro (91 stores)
Arizona: Tucson metro (20 stores)
Georgia: Atlanta metro (133 stores)
Iowa: Des Moines metro (23 stores)
Kansas: Wichita metro (38 stores)
Kansas / Missouri: Kansas City metro (83 stores)

North and South Carolina: Charlotte metro (39 stores)
Oklahoma: Tulsa metro (77 stores)
South Carolina: Greenville / Spartanburg metro (36 stores)
Texas: Dallas / Fort Worth metro (135 stores)

All stores are owned and operated by the company.

The QuikTrip Corporation, more commonly known as QuikTrip (QT), is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based chain of convenience stores that primarily operates in the Midwestern, Southern, and Southeastern United States.
The first QuikTrip was opened in 1958 in Tulsa by Burt Holmes and Chester Cadieux. The company expanded outside of Oklahoma in 1968, and started selling gasoline in 1971.[1] Chester's son, Chet, Jr., is the current CEO.
Since 1991, QuikTrip has promoted its gasoline as "high-quality" with an unconditional guarantee. In 2005, QuikTrip and Chevron were the first two retailers to earn a "Top Tier" rating from General Motors, BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, and Toyota. (The "Top Tier" rating exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency's standards for gasoline additives.)[2]

Overview[edit]
QuikTrip has been consistently listed among Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. The January 2006 version of the rankings placed QT at #21, ninth among companies classified as "mid-size.", for 2008 QT was ranked 27 in Fortune's top 100 list[3] QuikTrip often uses this fact in recruiting new employees. QuikTrip also ranked 33rd on Forbes magazine's list of largest private companies in 2016.[4]
History[edit]
The first QuikTrip store was opened in a Tulsa, Oklahoma strip mall in 1958, which sold a limited selection of groceries with high prices for the convenience.[5] QuikTrip began to sell gasoline in 1971 as states legalized self-service stations. In the early 1970s, co-founder Cadieux eliminated slow-moving merchandise from the stores' inventory, such as canned vegetables, and stocked a larger quantity of items, priced low for high-volume sales, such as beer, soda, coffee, cigarettes, and candy.[5]
QuikTrip had its own branded goods marketed from the 1970s-1980s, including QT Beer — QT for "Quittin' Time." The ad campaign, "It's QT Time Again," would often show a dog named Lamar. The dog's owner was portrayed in television commercials by actor Ben Jones, who often asked the dog, "Ain't that right, Lamar?"[6]
In 1988, upon rapid expansions into the St. Louis and Atlanta markets, QuikTrip began a renovation of all stores, primarily replacing the earthtone exterior and interior with a bright red color scheme. The interior decor featured red countertops and a red quarry tile floor; almond tile on the walls interspersed with painted red sections of the walls to create contrast. Some gold trim maintained continuity from the previous decor. The company also took more care with landscaping around the store.[5] By the early 1990s, QuikTrip began to offer fast foods and fountain beverages at its stores, being the first convenience store to offer a self-serve soda fountain and a self-serve coffee bar. Expensive advertising led the company to phase out the private label beer by this time.[5]
In 1994, QuikTrip acquired the former Memorex/Telex Communications headquarters in Tulsa and remodeled part of the building for its Oklahoma division. In 2003, QuikTrip decided to consolidate all employees into one corporate campus in south Tulsa and sold the building to Community Care College.[7]
In 2014, a QuikTrip store in Ferguson, Missouri was looted and subsequently burned in a riot following the fatal August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown.[8]
Products and services[edit]

In an attempt to increase speed and improve customer service at checkout, QuikTrip asks customers to stand at the counter versus standing in a long line. Employees are taught at orientation to go provide assistance on an additional register when the customer to cashier ratio exceeds 3:1, and to direct customers to the closest available checkout.[citation needed]
Since the early 1990s, QuikTrip has sold a private label brand of fast food, "Quick 'n Tasty" and "HOTZI sandwiches". "Quick 'n Tasty" heat-and-serve sandwiches include Texas Ham and Cheese, BarBQ Pork Rib, and the Super Po Boy. "HOTZI" breakfast sandwiches included the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and the breakfast burrito.[5]
In 2012, QuikTrip began an initiative of offering fresh food made daily at its own bakery and commissary referred to as QT Kitchens. The products includes fresh sandwiches, wraps, salads, fruit, and various pastries made and delivered daily.[9] Since then, QuikTrip has expanded the "QT Kitchens" brand to include actual kitchens in their stores with made-to-order hot food as well as specialty drinks.[10] The company also retrofitted their older style stores to include the new kitchen operations, in addition to building entirely new "Gen 3" stores.
Travel centers[edit]
During rapid expansion in the late 1980s, some QuikTrip stores included large 'travel centers.' A smaller version of a truck stop, the travel centers included a 5,000-square-foot store, 12 gasoline pumps, five diesel fuel pumps with elevated canopy to accommodate large trucks, a truck scale, and a store to serve the needs of truck drivers.[5]
Dual-branded stores[edit]
In 1994, QuikTrip began test-marketing a dual-brand concept in St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Atlanta, where a 3,000-square-foot Wendy's store was attached to each QuikTrip convenience store. In Des Moines, QuikTrip opened a new store with a Burger King with a separate entry and a drive-through window, but a passageway allowing movement between the convenience store and the restaurant.[5]
Non-traditional stores[edit]
In October 2007, QuikTrip opened a store within the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri.[11] The location only offered concessions and not gasoline. The store was closed in mid-2013.[12] The company's second store without gasoline—store No.1700— opened in midtown Atlanta at the Viewpoint Midtown condominium building on Peachtree Street.
In 2008, QuikTrip signed an agreement with the city of Grand Prairie, Texas for naming rights to the Grand Prairie AirHogs' new stadium, to be named QuikTrip Park. The deal included a QuikTrip booth at the stadium selling QT Kitchens products at the park for store price.[13]
Locations[edit]
QuikTrip operates 758 stores[14] which are located in the following areas of the United States:

Arizona: Phoenix metro (91 stores)
Arizona: Tucson metro (20 stores)
Georgia: Atlanta metro (133 stores)
Iowa: Des Moines metro (23 stores)
Kansas: Wichita metro (38 stores)
Kansas / Missouri: Kansas City metro (83 stores)
Missouri / Illinois: St. Louis metro (73 stores)
Nebraska / Iowa: Omaha metro (10 stores)
North and South Carolina: Charlotte metro (39 stores)
Oklahoma: Tulsa metro (77 stores)
South Carolina: Greenville / Spartanburg metro (36 stores)
Texas: Dallas / Fort Worth metro (135 stores)

All stores are owned and operated by the company.
In the Dallas/Fort Worth and Atlanta metro areas, QuikTrip competes head to head with RaceTrac, an Atlanta-based convenience store chain that is very similar to QuikTrip inside and out. Both chains tend to have new clean facilities with abundant on-site lighting and a large convenience area.[15][16] In many cases, the two competitors are located directly across the street or on opposite street corners from one another.[17]
Because the company operates stores in Iowa and holds the trademarks to the name within that state, competing chain Kwik Trip uses a different name for their stores in the state, Kwik Star
In the Phoenix metropolitan area, there are no QuikTrip stores located within the city limits of the suburb of Scottsdale. This is due to a city ordinance that regulates the design and build of gas and service stations within city limits that severely goes against the company's distinct uniform design of their stores.[citation needed] Neither the city nor the company will give in to the other, therefore Scottsdale is the only city in the Phoenix area without a QT.
The company has run into similar issues in Overland Park, Kansas, but it's more from desire to make the city more "pedestrian-friendly".. [18]

In the Phoenix metropolitan area, there are no QuikTrip stores located within the city limits of the suburb of Scottsdale. This is due to a city ordinance that regulates the design and build of gas and service stations within city limits that severely goes against the company's distinct uniform design of their stores.[citation needed] Neither the city nor the company will give in to the other, therefore Scottsdale is the only city in the Phoenix area without a QT.
The company has run into similar issues in Overland Park, Kansas, but it's more from desire to make the city more "pedestrian-friendly".. [18]

The QuikTrip Corporation, more commonly known as QuikTrip (QT), is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based chain of convenience stores that primarily operates in the Midwestern, Southern, and Southeastern United States.
The first QuikTrip was opened in 1958 in Tulsa by Burt Holmes and Chester Cadieux. The company expanded outside of Oklahoma in 1968, and started selling gasoline in 1971.[1] Chester's son, Chet, Jr., is the current CEO.
Since 1991, QuikTrip has promoted its gasoline as "high-quality" with an unconditional guarantee. In 2005, QuikTrip and Chevron were the first two retailers to earn a "Top Tier" rating from General Motors, BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, and Toyota. (The "Top Tier" rating exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency's standards for gasoline additives.)[2]

Overview[edit]
QuikTrip has been consistently listed among Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. The January 2006 version of the rankings placed QT at #21, ninth among companies classified as "mid-size.", for 2008 QT was ranked 27 in Fortune's top 100 list[3] QuikTrip often uses this fact in recruiting new employees. QuikTrip also ranked 33rd on Forbes magazine's list of largest private companies in 2016.[4]
History[edit]
The first QuikTrip store was opened in a Tulsa, Oklahoma strip mall in 1958, which sold a limited selection of groceries with high prices for the convenience.[5] QuikTrip began to sell gasoline in 1971 as states legalized self-service stations. In the early 1970s, co-founder Cadieux eliminated slow-moving merchandise from the stores' inventory, such as canned vegetables, and stocked a larger quantity of items, priced low for high-volume sales, such as beer, soda, coffee, cigarettes, and candy.[5]
QuikTrip had its own branded goods marketed from the 1970s-1980s, including QT Beer — QT for "Quittin' Time." The ad campaign, "It's QT Time Again," would often show a dog named Lamar. The dog's owner was portrayed in television commercials by actor Ben Jones, who often asked the dog, "Ain't that right, Lamar?"[6]
In 1988, upon rapid expansions into the St. Louis and Atlanta markets, QuikTrip began a renovation of all stores, primarily replacing the earthtone exterior and interior with a bright red color scheme. The interior decor featured red countertops and a red quarry tile floor; almond tile on the walls interspersed with painted red sections of the walls to create contrast. Some gold trim maintained continuity from the previous decor. The company also took more care with landscaping around the store.[5] By the early 1990s, QuikTrip began to offer fast foods and fountain beverages at its stores, being the first convenience store to offer a self-serve soda fountain and a self-serve coffee bar. Expensive advertising led the company to phase out the private label beer by this time.[5]
In 1994, QuikTrip acquired the former Memorex/Telex Communications headquarters in Tulsa and remodeled part of the building for its Oklahoma division. In 2003, QuikTrip decided to consolidate all employees into one corporate campus in south Tulsa and sold the building to Community Care College.[7]
In 2014, a QuikTrip store in Ferguson, Missouri was looted and subsequently burned in a riot following the fatal August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown.[8]
Products and services[edit]

In an attempt to increase speed and improve customer service at checkout, QuikTrip asks customers to stand at the counter versus standing in a long line. Employees are taught at orientation to go provide assistance on an additional register when the customer to cashier ratio exceeds 3:1, and to direct customers to the closest available checkout.[citation needed]
Since the early 1990s, QuikTrip has sold a private label brand of fast food, "Quick 'n Tasty" and "HOTZI sandwiches". "Quick 'n Tasty" heat-and-serve sandwiches include Texas Ham and Cheese, BarBQ Pork Rib, and the Super Po Boy. "HOTZI" breakfast sandwiches included the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and the breakfast burrito.[5]
In 2012, QuikTrip began an initiative of offering fresh food made daily at its own bakery and commissary referred to as QT Kitchens. The products includes fresh sandwiches, wraps, salads, fruit, and various pastries made and delivered daily.[9] Since then, QuikTrip has expanded the "QT Kitchens" brand to include actual kitchens in their stores with made-to-order hot food as well as specialty drinks.[10] The company also retrofitted their older style stores to include the new kitchen operations, in addition to building entirely new "Gen 3" stores.
Travel centers[edit]
During rapid expansion in the late 1980s, some QuikTrip stores included large 'travel centers.' A smaller version of a truck stop, the travel centers included a 5,000-square-foot store, 12 gasoline pumps, five diesel fuel pumps with elevated canopy to accommodate large trucks, a truck scale, and a store to serve the needs of truck drivers.[5]
Dual-branded stores[edit]
In 1994, QuikTrip began test-marketing a dual-brand concept in St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Atlanta, where a 3,000-square-foot Wendy's store was attached to each QuikTrip convenience store. In Des Moines, QuikTrip opened a new store with a Burger King with a separate entry and a drive-through window, but a passageway allowing movement between the convenience store and the restaurant.[5]
Non-traditional stores[edit]
In October 2007, QuikTrip opened a store within the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri.[11] The location only offered concessions and not gasoline. The store was closed in mid-2013.[12] The company's second store without gasoline—store No.1700— opened in midtown Atlanta at the Viewpoint Midtown condominium building on Peachtree Street.
In 2008, QuikTrip signed an agreement with the city of Grand Prairie, Texas for naming rights to the Grand Prairie AirHogs' new stadium, to be named QuikTrip Park. The deal included a QuikTrip booth at the stadium selling QT Kitchens products at the park for store price.[13]
Locations[edit]
QuikTrip operates 758 stores[14] which are located in the following areas of the United States:

Arizona: Phoenix metro (91 stores)
Arizona: Tucson metro (20 stores)
Georgia: Atlanta metro (133 stores)
Iowa: Des Moines metro (23 stores)
Kansas: Wichita metro (38 stores)
Kansas / Missouri: Kansas City metro (83 stores)
Missouri / Illinois: St. Louis metro (73 stores)
Nebraska / Iowa: Omaha metro (10 stores)
North and South Carolina: Charlotte metro (39 stores)
Oklahoma: Tulsa metro (77 stores)
South Carolina: Greenville / Spartanburg metro (36 stores)
Texas: Dallas / Fort Worth metro (135 stores)

All stores are owned and operated by the company.
In the Dallas/Fort Worth and Atlanta metro areas, QuikTrip competes head to head with RaceTrac, an Atlanta-based convenience store chain that is very similar to QuikTrip inside and out. Both chains tend to have new clean facilities with abundant on-site lighting and a large convenience area.[15][16] In many cases, the two competitors are located directly across the street or on opposite street corners from one another.[17]
Because the company operates stores in Iowa and holds the trademarks to the name within that state, competing chain Kwik Trip uses a different name for their stores in the state, Kwik Star
In the Phoenix metropolitan area, there are no QuikTrip stores located within the city limits of the suburb of Scottsdale. This is due to a city ordinance that regulates the design and build of gas and service stations within city limits that severely goes against the company's distinct uniform design of their stores.[citation needed] Neither the city nor the company will give in to the other, therefore Scottsdale is the only city in the Phoenix area without a QT.
The company has run into similar issues in Overland Park, Kansas, but it's more from desire to make the city more "pedestrian-friendly".. [18]

					DISMISS; and Opinion Filed March 25, 2015. S In The Court of Appeals Fifth District of Texas at Dallas No. 05-14-01055-CV LAKEITH AMIR-SHARIF, Appellant V. CHESTER CADIEUX, III AND QUICKTRIP CORPORATION., Appellees On Appeal from the 191st Judicial District Court Dallas County, Texas Trial Court Cause No. DC-14-03842 MEMORANDUM OPINION Before Justices Bridges, Fillmore, and Brown Opinion by Justice Fillmore Appellant appeals the trial court’s July 8, 2014 order consolidating DC-14-03842, Lakeith Amir-Sharif v Chester Cadieux, III and Quik Trip Corporation. with DC-09-13818, Lakeith Amir-Sharif v. Quick Trip Corp., et al. and administratively closing DC-14-03842, Lakeith Amir-Sharif v Chester Cadieux, III and Quik Trip Corporation. The case into which appellant’s claims were consolidated, DC-09-13818, Lakeith Amir-Sharif v. Quick Trip Corp, et al., remains pending on the trial court’s active docket. Appellant filed his notice of appeal of the July 8, 2014 administrative closure order on August 7, 2014. By letter dated September 16, 2014, the Court questioned its jurisdiction over this appeal. Specifically, the Court questioned whether the July 8, 2014 administrative closure order was an appealable order. Generally, this Court has jurisdiction only over appeals from final judgments. See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 195 (Tex. 2001). Interlocutory orders may be appealed only if permitted by statute. Jack B. Anglin Co., Inc. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 272 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). An order administratively closing a case is an interlocutory order, not a final judgment subject to direct appeal, because either party may move in the trial court to reopen a case that has been administratively closed. Jackson v. Texas Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, No. 01-10-00800-CV, 2012 WL 3775975 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 30, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.); see also Martin v. Commercial Metals Co., 138 S.W.3d 619, 622 n.2 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.) (explaining that trial court’s order abated and administratively closed case against severed party, but did not dismiss case, so that case remained subject to being re-opened on motion of any party). 1 Appellant argues, “[t]he . . . factual circumstances involve orders that are interlocutory and that can be challenged on appeal which this Court does have jurisdiction over.” Specifically, appellant contends the administrative closure of the case was improper because he was not provided notice and an opportunity to be heard on the transfer, consolidation and administrative closure of the case. He contends he was deprived of his constitutional rights of due process, due course of law, equal access to open courts, equal protection of the laws and the right to petition and be heard as a result. We disagree. A trial court may properly transfer and consolidate cases ex parte, without notice or a hearing. Starnes v. Holloway, 779 S.W.2d 86, 96–97 (Tex. App.— Dallas 1989, writ denied); Guinn v. Texas Christian Univ., 818 S.W.2d 930, 934 (Tex. App.— Fort Worth 1991, writ denied). Appellant further argues that the administrative closure of the case was improper because he had filed a motion for no-answer default judgment which the transferring court failed to act 1 We note that the clerk’s record reflects that appellant has filed an objection to the administrative closure of the case and a motion to vacate the order administratively closing the case, which he characterizes as a motions to re-open the case, but the trial court has not yet ruled on either of these motions. –2– upon before transferring the case. 2 “When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may . . . order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 174(a). 3 “When actions are properly consolidated they become merged and are thereafter treated as one suit. . . .” Perry v. Del Rio, 53 S.W.3d 818, 825 n.6 (Tex. App.—Austin), pet. dism'd, 66 S.W.3d 239 (Tex. 2001); see also Hong Kong Dev., Inc. v. Nguyen, 229 S.W.3d 415, 432 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (when a court orders true consolidation of two or more cases, the actions are merged and thereafter proceed as a single action); Rust v. Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co., 180 S.W. 95, 95 (1915) (“In the present case, the order of consolidation having been properly made, there remained no separable cause of action. It became but one suit....”). After consolidation all issues of law and fact are merged. Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. Box, 531 S.W.2d 401, 406 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Appellant’s motion for default judgment and any other motions that have not yet been determined remain pending in the consolidated suit. He has not been deprived of the right to seek a hearing on those motions. Because there is no basis for our assertion of jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. /Robert M. Fillmore/ ROBERT M. FILLMORE JUSTICE 141055F.P05 2 The clerk’s record reflects the motion for no answer default judgment was filed on July 18, 2014, after the orders transferring the case and administratively closing the case were signed. 3 Appellant has not appealed the order consolidating the cases. Rule 174 gives the trial court broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues of law or fact. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Martin, 942 S.W.2d 712, 716 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1997, no writ). An order of consolidation is an interlocutory order not subject to appeal. Carter v. Sun City Towing & Recovery, L.P., 225 S.W.3d 161, 162 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, no pet.) (“We can find no statute that expressly authorizes the interlocutory appeal of an order to consolidate separate lawsuits.”). –3– S Court of Appeals Fifth District of Texas at Dallas JUDGMENT LAKEITH AMIR-SHARIF, Appellant No. 05-14-01055-CV On Appeal from the 191st Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas Trial Court Cause No. DC-14-03842. Opinion delivered by Justice Fillmore. Justices Bridges and Brown participating. V. CHESTER CADIEUX, III AND QUICKTRIP CORPORATION, Appellees In accordance with this Court’s opinion of this date, the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. It is ORDERED that appellees CHESTER CADIEUX, III and QUICKTRIP CORPORATION recover their costs of this appeal from appellant LAKEITH AMIR-SHARIF. Judgment entered this 25th day of March, 2015. –4–

Court of Appeals of Texas,Dallas.
Lakeith AMIR–SHARIF, Appellant v. QUICK TRIP CORPORATION and Chester Cadieux III, Appellees.
No. 05–12–01143–CV.
    Decided: November 25, 2013

		Before Justices MOSELEY, LANG, and BROWN.Lakeith Amir–Sharif, pro se. Donna C. Peavler, for Quick Trip Corporation and Chester Cadieux III.
OPINIONLakeith Amir–Sharif, a pro se inmate, appeals the trial court's orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit against Quick Trip Corporation and Chester Cadieux III without prejudice. In six issues Amir–Sharif argues: (1) the trial court erred when it signed the order declaring him a vexatious litigant because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing and his appearance was due to a bench warrant, which resulted in an “ambush hearing”; (2) the trial court erred when it signed the order declaring him a vexatious litigant because the trial court had a ministerial duty to ensure that he was provided with the requisite advance notice of that hearing pursuant to section 11.053(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code; (3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's order declaring him a vexatious litigant; (4) the trial court erred when it failed to file the requested findings of fact and conclusions of law; (5) the trial court erred when it failed to have a hearing on his motions to reconsider the trial court's orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit; (6) the trial court erred as a matter of law when it signed the orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit because it failed to apply the “liberal construction” standard to his pleadings.We conclude the evidence is legally insufficient to support the order declaring Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant. The trial court's orders are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDIn his original petition, Amir–Sharif filed a premises liability lawsuit against Quick Trip Corporation and Cadieux, alleging he slipped and fell at a Quik Trip store. See also Amir–Sharif v. Quick Trip Corp., No. 05–09–01497–CV, 2011 WL 1367042, *1 (Tex.App.-Dallas Apr. 12, 2011, no pet.) (mem.op.). On November 5, 2009, Quick Trip filed (1) a motion under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 11.051 to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, and (2) a request under section 11.055 for Amir–Sharif to furnish security.  Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *1. The same day, the trial court set the motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant and request for security for hearing on November 12, 2009. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *1. On November 5, 2009, Quick Trip served Amir–Sharif with the motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, request for security, and notice of the November 12, 2009 hearing by regular mail. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *1. Amir–Sharif was not present at the November 12, 2009 hearing. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. After the hearing, the trial court signed an order granting Quick Trip's motion, declaring Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, and ordering Amir–Sharif to furnish security to the trial court to guarantee payment to Quick Trip for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. Amir–Sharif filed objections and a motion to vacate the order granting Quick Trip's motion, alleging he did not receive the requisite notice in advance of the hearing. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. Amir–Sharif failed to furnish the security by the deadline stated in the trial court's order and, without a hearing, the trial court dismissed without prejudice Amir–Sharif's claims. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. In addition, the trial court signed a prefiling order pursuant to section 11.101 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, prohibiting Amir–Sharif from filing, pro se, a new litigation in this state. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. Amir–Sharif appealed. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2. On appeal, this Court reversed the trial court's order because Amir–Sharif had inadequate time to respond to the motion and request in advance of the hearing, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *3.On June 23, 2011, after the case was remanded to the trial court, Amir–Sharif filed his second amended civil complaint, adding a claim for negligence. On August 19, 2011, Quick Trip and Cadieux filed another motion seeking to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant and requesting security. The motion was served on Amir–Sharif by certified mail. On August 29, 2011, Amir–Sharif filed a response to the motion. On September 6, 2011, Amir–Sharif filed a motion for telephonic hearing or video conference on Quick Trip and Cadieux's motion. Then, on October 6, 2011, Amir–Sharif filed his objection to the hearing scheduled for that date and sought a continuance. In response, counsel for Quick Trip and Cadieux sent Amir–Sharif a letter by certified mail, stating that, in accordance with his request, the hearing was rescheduled for October 26, 2011. However, it appears from the record on appeal that the hearing did not go forward.On February 2, 2012, the trial court signed an order that sua sponte determined the hearing on the motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant and request for security would be heard on March 8, 2012, a bench warrant would issue so that Amir–Sharif could appear and be heard at the hearing, and all other pending motions would be stayed until the trial court heard and determined the motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant. A bench warrant issued and Amir–Sharif appeared at the hearing. After the hearing, the trial court granted Quick Trip and Cadieux's motion, declaring Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant and requiring him to furnish security in the amount of $2,500 by April 20, 2012 or the case would be dismissed without prejudice. Also, pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 11.101, the trial court, on its own motion, rendered a prefiling order, prohibiting Amir–Sharif from filing, pro se, a new litigation in a court in this state. See Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.101(a) (West Supp.2012) ( “A court may, on its own motion ․, enter an order prohibiting a person from filing in propria persona, a new litigation in a court in this state”). On March 29, 2012, Amir–Sharif filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court's order declaring him a vexatious litigant. Amir–Sharif failed to furnish the required security by April 20, 2012. As a result, on April 26, 2012, the trial court dismissed Amir–Sharif's claims against Quick Trip and Cadieux without prejudice.On May 4, 2012, Amir–Sharif filed a motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing his lawsuit and a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court did not rule on Amir–Sharif's motions for reconsideration or enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.II. EFFECT OF PRIOR ORDER DECLARING AMIR–SHARIF VEXATIOUSOn September 9, 2013, this Court sent the parties a letter noting it appeared that Amir–Sharif had already been found to be a vexatious litigant. See Amir–Sharif v. Zeller, No. 07–10–0244–CV, 2011 WL 691378, *1 (Tex.App.-Amarillo Feb. 28, 2011, pet. denied) (mem.op.) (stating Amir–Sharif contends trial court erred in finding him to be a vexatious litigant). However, it was not clear whether the 242nd District Court, Swisher County, Texas, had rendered a prefiling order and Amir–Sharif was not listed on the Office of Court Administration's list of vexatious litigants posted on its website as a result of any order by the 242nd District Court. See Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.104 (West Supp.2012). Section 11.101(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that after a person has been found to be a vexatious litigant, “a court may ․ enter an order prohibiting a person from filing, in propria persona, a new litigation in a court in this state.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.101(a). As a result, this Court requested the parties to provide letter briefs addressing the issue of whether this appeal was moot as a result of any prior state court orders declaring Amir–Sharif to be a vexatious litigant together with sworn or certified copies of any relevant state court orders.Quick Trip and Cadieaux filed a certified copy of the 242nd District Court's order. That order did not include a prefiling order pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 11.101(a). See also In re Amir–Sharif, No. 07–11–00294, 2011 WL 3568940, *1 n. 2 (Tex.App.-Amarillo Aug. 15, 2011, orig. proceeding) (mem.op.). Accordingly, we conclude this appeal is not moot.II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCEIn issue three, Amir–Sharif argues the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's order declaring him a vexatious litigant. Amir–Sharif argues, in part, the following:The trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible error by failing to correctly apply the law at § 11.054 [Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code], which contains a “two (2) prong” prerequisite [Quick Trip and Cadieux] must bear the burden of establishing before [Amir–Sharif] can be declared a vexatious litigant․Under section 11.054, there are two (2) distinctive criterias [sic] that must first be met by [Quick Trip and Cadieux]. [Quick Trip and Cadieux] must prove: (1) [Amir–Sharif] has no realistic probability of prevailing on the claims presented in his lawsuit; and (2) that the factual requisite delineated under one of the three subsections of § 11.054 applies to [Amir–Sharif].․ [Amir–Sharif] has not only proffered his medical records, but also documentation of his communication with [Quick Trip and Cadieux's] accident claims department. [record citation omitted]․ If ever presented to a jury, [Amir–Sharif's] negligence and premises liability claims do have a reasonable probability for success, particularly in light of the supporting medical records proffered.On appeal, Amir–Sharif does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence showing that he has maintained in excess of five lawsuits that were determined to be frivolous, dismissed for want of prosecution, or decided adversely to him.1 Quick Trip and Cadieux respond that with regard to Amir–Sharif's negligence claim alleging a premises defect, he has no evidence that there was an unreasonably dangerous condition or that Quick Trip and Cadieux had actual or constructive knowledge of the unreasonable dangerous condition.A. Standard of ReviewAn appellate court reviews a trial court's declaration that a litigant is vexatious for an abuse of discretion. Amir–Sharif, 2011 WL 1367042, at *2; Harris v. Rose, 204 S.W.3d 903, 906 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, no pet.). However, a trial court's findings under chapter 11 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code may be reviewed for legal and factual sufficiency because section 11.054 requires the trial court to make evidentiary findings.  Willms v. Americas Tire Co., 190 S.W.3d 796, 801 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, pet. denied); Leonard v. Abbott, 171 S.W.3d 451, 459 (Tex.App.-Austin 2005, pet. denied).When examining a legal sufficiency challenge, an appellate court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged finding and indulges every reasonable inference that would support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex.2005). The ultimate test for legal sufficiency is whether the evidence would enable a reasonable and fair-minded fact finder to reach the verdict under review. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827. The fact finder is the sole judge of witness credibility and the weight to give to the testimony. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819.B. Applicable LawA court may find a plaintiff a vexatious litigant if the defendant shows: (1) there is not a reasonable probability the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation; and (2) there is other evidence regarding previous litigations by the defendant. Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.054; Willms, 190 S.W.3d at 804. Other evidence involving previous litigation may include evidence that the plaintiff, in the seven year period immediately preceding the date the defendant makes the motion under section 11.051, has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria persona at least five litigations other than in small claims court that have been (A) finally determined adversely to the plaintiff; (B) permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing; or (C) determined by a trial or appellate court to be frivolous or groundless under state or federal laws or rules of procedure. Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.054(1)(A), (B), and (C).The defendant seeking a vexatious litigant declaration bears the burden of establishing both parts of the test set out in section 11.054 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.054 (court may find plaintiff vexatious “if the defendant shows” no reasonable probability of prevailing and one of the three litigation histories); Drake v. Andrews, 294 S.W.3d 370, 375 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, pet. denied). The plaintiff may offer evidence to show there is a reasonable probability he will prevail in the litigation, but it is not his burden to do so. Drake, 294 S.W.3d at 375–76. When the defendant offers evidence sufficient to satisfy the second part of the test relating to litigation history, but fails to offer any evidence showing why the plaintiff could not prevail in the suit, the defendant has failed to meet his burden. Drake, 294 S.W.3d at 375–76.C. Application of the Law to the FactsIn his second amended civil complaint, Amir–Sharif sued Quick Trip and Cadieux “under the common law theories of negligence and personal injury, and premises liability.” In their motion seeking to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, Quick Trip and Cadieux argued that Amir–Sharif's cause of action was a negligence claim alleging a premises defect. They maintained in their motion, in part, that Amir–Sharif had “no evidence” that there was an unreasonably dangerous condition and that they had actual or constructive knowledge of the unreasonably dangerous condition.At the outset of the hearing on Quick Trip and Cadieux's motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, when the trial court invited counsel for Quick Trip and Cadieux to proceed with their offer of evidence, counsel stated, “there is not actually any evidence with regard to testimony.” Then, Quick Trip and Cadieux offered evidence of Amir–Sharif's pro se litigation history, which Amir–Sharif did not contest. In response, Amir–Sharif argued, in part, that Quick Trip and Cadieux “have only shown that they had previous cases,” “they haven't shown th[e] [trial court] anything that shows where [he] can't prove [his] claim,” and “they haven't—the two criterias [sic] haven't been met here for th[e] [trial court]—for them to—for their motion to be granted.” Amir–Sharif also cited this Court's opinion of Drake v. Andrews, 294 S.W.3d 370 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, pet. denied). Quick Trip and Cadieux replied:We have to show that [Amir–Sharif] has no reasonable probability to prevail in this claim. He has filed a premises liability claim. He has to prove that Quick Trip had actual constructive notice of this premises defect.He can't show that. There is not going to be any evidence of their actual knowledge of this substance on the ground because he is not going to be able to get that evidence. There won't be any such evidence. He has no reasonable probability of prevailing on this claimThen, the trial court asked Amir–Sharif what evidence he had that the condition he claimed caused his injury existed for such a period of time that Quick Trip and Cadieux reasonably should have known of it or that they had actual knowledge of it. Amir–Sharif responded thatThere are other witnesses who were there who—who I intend to have come before this Court and testify that the water or liquid, whatever was on that floor, was there prior to my coming in there.Mr. Cory Vaughn, who I also named as a defendant in this case, when the incident happened, he came and apologized and said that he had gotten busy. And that's why I had initially named him as a defendant. You could just bring him into court. I have been desperately trying to get him served so we can bring him into court and let him explain what happened.Without the discovery which I have requested from them, we can't find out their—their—they had like inspection—inspection slips where they were cleaning up. I have asked—I have asked [Quick Trip and Cadieux's counsel] for those documents, and they are resisting that there.This is what—I didn't—and my understanding was that the suit, I'm alleging personal injury and premises liability. They knew or should have known that the—that that water or liquid was there if they—if they go and survey or look around the premises in a timely manner, and they didn't. They couldn't have. Had they done so, they would have cleaned it up. Someone would have seen it and cleaned it up.Mr. Vaughn's statement to me in front of other people that he apologized because he had gotten busy, that—that—that kind of infers that, you know, you got behind and maybe this here was there, and he could have found it before the incident took place. But he didn't, and I was injured as a result of that.After this argument by Amir–Sharif, the trial court inquired whether there was anything further from either side and both parties responded that there was not.In this case, Quick Trip and Cadieux offered evidence of Amir–Sharif's pro se litigation history, which appears sufficient to satisfy the second part of the test set out in section 11.054 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. See Drake, 294 S.W.3d at 375–76. However, Quick Trip and Cadieux offered only argument, but no evidence showing why Amir–Sharif could not prevail in this litigation. See Drake, 294 S.W.3d at 375–76. Section 11.054 specifically states that “A court may find a plaintiff a vexatious litigant if the defendant shows that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the defendant” and one of the three litigation histories. Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code Ann. § 11.054 (emphasis added); see Drake, 294 S.W.3d at 375.After reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude Quick Trip and Cadieux failed to carry their burden and the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court's order declaring Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant. Issue three is decided in favor of Amir–Sharif.VIII. CONCLUSIONThe evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court's order declaring Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant.The trial court's orders are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.FOOTNOTES1.  During the hearing on Quick Trip and Cadieux's motion to declare Amir–Sharif a vexatious litigant, Amir–Sharif stated, “I don't object to any of the argument about—and just to save the Court some time, I never objected to the one criteria with regards to the previous filings.”Opinion by Justice LANG.
