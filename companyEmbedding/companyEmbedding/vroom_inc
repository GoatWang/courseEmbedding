San Francisco, CARead All ReviewsVroom IndexData for Smart Drivers$2,545Average Savings on Vroom right nowLearn MoreVroom ValuesWe believe buying a car should be fun, easy, and affordable. Here’s how Vroom is leading the revolution.

BEFORE
Haggling Was Mandatory
Regardless of your budget. your local dealer always wanted to negotiate the price. This led to an
              experience in which you spent more than you wanted and had your time wasted.


AFTER
Value Pricing Comes In Below Market
We've eliminated the middle man and made the whole process more efficient. Our cars are priced as low as
              possible, which means there's no need for haggling.


A great place to buy a vehicle at an affordable price. The people are very friendly and strive to make sure
              that each customer gets the best bang for their buck!
Ja-Quay L. Amarillo, TX 
              Chrysler 200



BEFORE
Issues Under The Hood
You bought the perfect car, only to have it break down the same week you took it off the lot. The seller was of little help and you were stuck with a fixer-upper.


AFTER
Multiple Inspections
Every car we sell includes a clean, accident-free AutoCheck® report. Vroom cars are inspected multiple times for safety, mechanical, and cosmetic issues.


Excellent experience, very friendly staff, and all vehicles are in immaculate condition. I will never purchase a used vehicle anywhere else again. Thanks!
Antonio I. Waco, TX
            Dodge Ram 2500



BEFORE
Returning a car? Not gonna happen
There’s no way you can really know a car after just 20 minutes. And once you drove off the lot, there was no going back.


AFTER
7-Day No Regrets Home Drive
When you buy a Vroom car you can drive it at home for seven days or 250 miles. Make sure it’s the perfect fit, and if it isn’t, we’ll take it back, no questions asked with a full refund in hand.


The process was easy! The 7-day test drive gives you confidence in buying a car sight unseen, and the 3-month/6K warranty gives you complete peace of mind.
Joe A. Elmhurst, IL
              Porsche 911



BEFORE
You Accepted Poor Financing
Maybe you got the car price you wanted, but got crushed on your loan. There’s no reason your dealer should profit from a high interest rate.


AFTER
The Freedom To Choose
Vroom saves you the hassle of shopping around by offering over 30 financing partners who will help find the best option for you.


Everyone one was friendly and worked to help me get the best rate to get my monthly payment down where I needed it to be. Process was smooth and fast!
Diego H. Grand Prairie, TX
            Chrysler 300



BEFORE
Only New Cars Came Protected
Every car should be sold with coverage, but your dealer or private seller didn’t/couldn’t offer a warranty. That left you and your car at risk.


AFTER
A Warranty for Every Car
We only sell used cars, but that doesn’t mean we can’t treat them like new. Each Vroom car sold includes a 90-day, 6,000-mile warranty that covers literally every mechanical part in your car.


This is the second vehicle I purchased from Vroom. The staff is pleasant and professional. The warranty along with Danny Warren's commitment to customer satisfaction makes me feel confident in my purchases from Vroom.
