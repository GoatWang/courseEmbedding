Working to bring new hope to patients with orphan diseases of the kidney

















About Us







ABOUT US

Palladio Biosciences, Inc, a private biotech company, was founded in 2015 to develop transformative medicines for orphan diseases of the kidney.
Our first product, lixivaptan, is being re-positioned for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease (PKD).  PKD is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases.  PKD causes numerous fluid-filled cysts to grow in both kidneys.  It is a life-limiting, chronic and progressive disease. PKD is the 4th leading cause of kidney failure and carries a significant financial and emotional burden, affecting entire families.
There is no cure for PKD and no drug has been approved for treatment in the United States.  We are developing lixivaptan as a safe and effective agent to be used chronically to prevent the progression of PKD.
We closed a Series A venture round during the third quarter of 2016, allowing us to acquire lixivaptan and begin building our management team, which is supplemented with an extensive network of key consultants and service providers.
