Lindsay and Billy Webster


Involvement with the SC Campaign

Lindsay and Billy Webster are recognized throughout the Upstate as thoughtful and generous philanthropists, and their involvement in issues related to health and well-being have had a positive impact on Spartanburg County and beyond. The SC Campaign has been very fortunate to have their voices included in the ongoing dialogue around preventing teen pregnancy in South Carolina. Their personal involvement on a variety of issues has helped remove barriers in Spartanburg County and across the state and sent a message to others that it is OK to get involved in the issue. Lindsay and Billy played a critically important leadership role in raising significant funds directed to stabilizing and improving The Tobias Teen Health Center when budget cuts at the state health department that threatened to close the facility. Tobias is now seen as one of the state’s “shining stars” in the delivery of comprehensive, teen friendly health services to young people. Lindsay and Billy have also been actively involved in recruiting other partners and donors to support the SC Campaign’s ongoing work since the organization established a formal presence in Spartanburg County in 2008. Their passion and energy around this issue is contagious, unique, and greatly appreciated.
Lindsay and Billy have been actively involved in recruiting other partners and donors to support the efforts of the SC Campaign. Lindsay’s efforts specifically go beyond philanthropy and include hands-on approach to, and interest in, moving prevention conversations forward. She has been very active in an ongoing dialogue about increasing and improving direct outreach to teens and their parents in Spartanburg County, and as a thoughtful and committed voice in efforts to improve the delivery of comprehensive sexuality education in the seven Spartanburg school districts.
"Lindsay and Billy Webster have been tremendous supporters of the SC Campaign and the issue of teen pregnancy prevention, in general, over the years. Lindsay's creative energy in Spartanburg has allowed us to think out of the box and bring ideas to the community in how we can reach out to young people and the adults who serve young people in a different way. And, their financial support has allowed us to address teen pregnancy in a comprehensive and intensive way that I don't know we could have done without them." --Molly Talbot-Metz, Vice President of Programs, Mary Black Foundation
Biographies
Lindsay Webster is originally from Washington D.C. and attended to Barnard College in New York City. She has always been interested in both teen pregnancy prevention and access to birth control for all which began when she interned at a Planned Parenthood clinic as a senior in high school doing patient intake and answering the hotline. She lives in Spartanburg, S.C. with four children ages 16, 14, 12 and 9. Lindsay is a breast cancer survivor of eight years. She feels the need every day to act on behalf of those around us who struggle to find justice, whether financial, racial or social.
