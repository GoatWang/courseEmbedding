Company Introduction
HealthRenu Medical produces breakthrough products that are an effective and affordable answer to healthcare's major skin-related challenges. The products are made from all-natural ingredients with a heavy concentration of essential fatty acids. This unique approach places these natural ingredients back into the skin with the deep penetrating ability of the product. HealthRenu products are bioactive and have transdermal abilities without side effects. 

HealthRenu Medical has developed a breakthrough method in coping with healthcare's skin-related challenges. Skin that is compromised due to age, illness, or a less than ideal immune system loses its natural defenses and becomes susceptible to damage. The results can range from poor circulation and serious infections to wounds that won't heal.

HealthRenu products address these conditions in a natural way as they are produced from all-natural ingredients containing a heavy concentration of essential fatty acids. These fatty acids are important in restoring normal skin function that leads to healing and deterring infection. Since HealthRenu products are all natural, they are able to restore normal skin function with no side effects at a fraction of the cost of other options on the market today. 

We currently have 7 products out of R&D stages:

Derm-All Gel
Skin Renu Plus
Skin Renu Lotion
Skin Renu Skin Therapy
Deep Relief
Sports Medicine
Renu Care Wash

ITEM  1.     CHANGES  IN  CONTROL  OF  THE  REGISTRANT. 

      As  a  result  of the acquisition of Health Renu Medical, Inc., a Delaware
corporation  ("Health  Renu"  or  the  "Company"), the control of the Registrant
shifted  to  the  former  shareholders of Health Renu.  The following individual
will  exercise  control  of  the  Registrant.                                   

     Name               No. of shares                                 Percentage
     ----               -------------                                 ----------
Darrell  Good           7,375,000(1)                                   46.8%  

(1) Includes 795,000 shares issued to Cheryl Good, the wife of Darrell Good, and
1,080,000  shares  issued  to  the  six  children  of  Mr.  Good  and  his wife,
collectively.                                                                   

ITEM  2.   ACQUISITION  OF  DISPOSITION  OF  ASSETS. 

    On  September  26,  2003,  the  Registrant  acquired 84% of the issued and
outstanding  shares  of  Health  Renu  in  exchange for 12,925,000 shares of the
Registrant's  common stock.  Upon 100% shareholder approval of Health Renu which
is  anticipated,  there  will  be  15,763,626  shares of the Registrant's common
stock outstanding,  which includes the conversion of the Series 2000A Preferred 
Stock into 1,765 shares of common stock and the conversion of $379,902 of notes 
and  accrued  wages  into  379,902  shares  of  common  stock.                  

DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  BUSINESS                                        

   For the last three (3) years since inception, Health Renu has been in the
medical research and developmental stage.  The Company has focused on improving 
its products and has had very little production or revenues.  Most of Health    
Renu's sales have been in the area of emergency, non-healing wounds of the human
body such as Staph infections, stage 1,2,3,4, diabetic ulcers, gain green, and  
amputations.  The Company has satisfied the United States Federal Drug          
Administration (the "FDA") requirements to sell it products to all medical      
related companies including hospitals, walk-in clinics and nursing homes or     
directly to consumers.                                                          

DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS & SERVICES                          
The Company developed a product line (the "Product Line" or "Finished 
Products") consisting of the following eight (8) products:

Patent Pending Product with clinical studies.                                   

The Company plans to begin marketing the Product Line directly to consumers     
rather than strictly to hospitals, walk-in clinics and nursing homes.           

COMPETITIVE BUSINESS CONDITIONS                                       

     The  market for healthcare products is estimated at 150 billion dollars, of
which the Company has acquired less than one-percent (1%) market share with its 
Product Line.  The Company will depend on marketing efforts to increase its     
market share.  The Company believes that with an aggressive marketing campaign  
it can quickly generate more revenue and establish its Product Line nationwide. 
The Company's cost for research and development is fully paid.  The Company     
intends to spend approximately 40% of its resources to increase its market share
over the next twelve  months.                                                   

  The Company plans to compete based on price.  The Company's products are
priced lower than similar products offered by competitors.  The Company intends 
to operate with minimal overhead costs by outsourcing its shipping, receiving,  
purchasing, and production functions.                                           

NO  DEPENDENCE  ON  ONE  OR  A  FEW  CUSTOMERS                                  
The  Company  does  not  currently  depend  on  any one or a few customers.

PATENTS,  TRADEMARKS  &  LICENSES                                               
The Company owns the registered trademark, Healthrenu.  The Company does
not hold any patents or licenses.  The Company, however, has exclusive rights to
the marketing of a tapeless iv holder as well as latex surgical gloves.  The    
Company is uncertain whether or not it will purchase the patent rights from the 
principal patent owners.                                                        

NEED  FOR  GOVERNMENT  APPROVAL                                                 
The Company has satisfied all FDA requirements with respect to its Finished
Products  for  sales  directly  to consumers and medical related companies.  The
Company  is currently developing new products for which it will need to meet FDA
requirements  in  order  to sale these products to consumers and medical related
companies.  The  Company does not expect that when finished developing these new
products  it  will  be  unable  to  also  obtain FDA approval for sales of these
products  to  consumers  and  medical  related  companies.                      

P-->8-K4th Page of 5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 4th
The  Company  is currently seeking approval for reimbursement from Medicare
with  respect  to  both  finished  and trial products.  The Company expects that
obtaining  such  approval and reimbursement will increase future revenue in     
relation to  what  it  expects  such  revenue  would  be  if  approved.         

RESEARCH  &  DEVELOPMENT  OVER  PAST  TWO  YEARS                                
The  Company's  activities  have  consisted  primarily  of  research  and
development  activities.  During  the  last two (2) years, the Company conducted
research on a daily basis.  The Company has various products in the early stages
of  development.  The  Company  obtained  the  services of Dr. Sparks to conduct
research  and  development  for  the Company.  The Company issued 200,000 common
shares,  to  Dr. Sparks in exchange for his services.  The agreement between Dr.
Sparks  and the Company provides that Dr. Sparks will use Healthrenu products on
his  patients  during their research and development stage.  Dr. Sparks has paid
the  Company  approximately  $61,000, of which $25,000 was for stock and $36,000
was  for  the  Company's  products.                                             

EMPLOYEES                                                                       
The  Company  has  two (2) full-time employees and outsources a majority of
its  operations.  The  Company  intends  to  hire three (3) additional full-time
employees  within  the  next  ninety  (90)  days  to  provide shipping services,
operation  services  and  accounting services. The Company estimates that it can
fully  operate  with  as  few  as  fifteen  (15)  full-time  employees.         

DESCRIPTION  OF  PROPERTY                                                       
The  Company  has two (2) business locations, one in Guntersville, Alabama,
and  the  other  in  Friendswood,  Texas.  The  Company  is  in  the  process of
relocating  its  business operations in Guntersville.  The Company does not have
any  information  on  the  new  Guntersville  location  at  this  time.         

    The  Friendswood  office  is  located  at  307  South  Friendswood  Drive,
Suite E-1, Friendswood, Texas 77546.  Friendswood is a suburb located Southeast 
of Houston, Texas.  The  Company has entered into a one (1) year lease for 1,300
square feet of  office  space  for  the  Friendswood office.  The lease provides
for monthly payments  of  $1,300.  The  Friendswood  office  handles  the       
workload  of  the Guntersville  office  during  the  relocation.                

RELATED  PARTY  TRANSACTIONS                                                    
The  Company  has  entered into an agreement with Dr. Sparks, a Director of
the Company who will likely be added as a Director of the Registrant in the near
future, whereby Dr. Sparks will conduct research and development for the Company
and  use  HealthRenu  products  on his patients during the products' development
stage.  Dr.  Sparks  purchases products from the Company at wholesale prices for
use  in  his  medical  practice and paid the Company $36,000 over the last three
years.  There  are  currently  no other transactions between the Company and its
officers,  directors  or  more  than  five-percent  (5%)  shareholders.

LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS                                                              

There are currently no legal  proceedings.                            

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

    Dependence Upon External Financing. It is imperative that we raise capital
to  expand  our  operations  and  stay  in  business.  We require capital of    
approximately $500,000  to  implement  our  business  plan. If we are unable to 
obtain  debt and/or  equity  financing  upon  terms  that  our management deems 
sufficiently favorable,  or  at  all, it would have a materially adverse impact 
upon  our  ability  to  pursue  our  business  strategy and maintain our current
operations.                                                                     

     Even if Product is Successful, We May Be Unable to Sell Our Product. In the
event  we  are  successful  in completing our product, there can be no assurance
that  we will be able to sell our products at all, or enough at prices needed to
maintain  operations.                                                           

ITEM 5.   OTHER EVENTS.

Darrell Good has become the Registrant's President and a Director.
