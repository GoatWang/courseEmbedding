About Us




Introduction


Our Vision
	Cobalt’s vision is to become one of the world’s most admired exploration and production companies by keeping commitments, adhering to our values, achieving results as promised, and consistently delivering top quartile rates of return. Our business model allows us to move quickly and seamlessly through the exploration, appraisal, development and production processes.

Our History
	Cobalt’s pioneering approach to oil exploration was built on the unique idea that an agile company, armed with exceptional human talent, the best available seismic data, outstanding assets and a disciplined business model, can compete with the world’s largest energy companies. Through our experienced workforce, innovative technology and pioneering siting techniques, the company has built a carefully selected, world-class oil portfolio in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa.

Our Future
	As we transition from an oil exploration company to exploration and development, we continue our endeavor to be a successful, enduring enterprise that will generate wealth for our investors and provide an outstanding professional experience for our team members. Our track record of exploration excellence continues with twelve deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. These achievements, combined with a disciplined plan for future oil production, position the company exceptionally well for long-term value creation.

At Cobalt, we are discovering opportunity and producing value.



Our People




	The Cobalt team  consists of highly experienced geoscientists, engineers, business professionals and technicians, led by a management team with a proven record of success.

	Our highly-skilled professionals have an average of more than 25 years of oil exploration, development and production experience. Members of our management team have negotiated globally significant commercial agreements and developed many long-standing relationships with independent, major and national oil companies, host governments and service providers.

	Cobalt’s staff and management are motivated by a shared vision and clear business model, enabling them to do what they do best: find, develop and produce oil. Our people combine the best data and technology with the expertise and collective insight necessary to locate the next best opportunities, and reduce cycle times at every phase of the exploration, appraisal, development and production process.

	Cobalt’s management team has a proven, differentiated track record of successfully participating in our industry’s largest global projects over the past two decades. We have played key roles in major offshore discoveries, and have been instrumental in bringing these large-scale global hydrocarbon projects through development to production.

	We have negotiated globally significant and challenging commercial agreements, and we have developed many long-standing relationships with independent oil companies, host governments, national oil companies and service providers – all of which enhances Cobalt’s competitiveness and our ability to deliver.

Cobalt International Energy L.P.




Address:
920 Memorial City Way, Suite 100
Houston, TX 77024
Operating in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, Cobalt International Energy specializes in the exploration of oil. Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cobalt has primarily been an oil exploration company since its inception in 2005, but the company is focusing on expanding its services to include new project development and oil production projects.
Cobalt’s oil exploration business is operated through the use of its assets that feature deepwater subsalt and pre-salt regions. To acquire these assets, Cobalt utilizes subsurface and seismic data to determine key regions which may contain valuable oil reservoirs.
In 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an investigation order against Cobalt due to an allegation that they had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cobalt, the SEC alleged, had access to its Angola oil wells due to the bribery of foreign officials. In January of 2015, the SEC dropped its investigation although there is a parallel investigation being conducted by the US Justice Department.
