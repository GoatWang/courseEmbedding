              Gold prices settled Friday at their highest level since mid-June, up 1.1% for the week, as reports of another missile test in North Korea and further weakness in the U.S. dollar boosted investment demand for the precious metal. August gold  added $8.40, or 0.7%, to settle at $1,268.40 an ounce. The metal scored a third weekly gain in a row.

Oil sets sights on biggest weekly gain of the year
              
              Oil readies for a weekly gain of more than 8%, which would be the largest such rise since early December, with prices getting a lift from renewed production-curb commitments from OPEC members as well as uncertainty in Venezuela.

Stitch Fix has confidentially filed to go public: report
              
              Stitch Fix, a subscription clothing service, has filed confidentially to go public, according to TechCrunch, citing sources. The company has been rumored to be going public for months, with Reuters reporting in May that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to underwrite the offering. Under the JOBS Act, companies are able to file confidentially before releasing a public prospectus. In late June, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to allow confidential filing for all companies, rather than the previous standard of companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion. Stitch Fix would be another test of a subscription service model, after Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s  offering earlier this month. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 28% month-to-date, while the S&P 500  has gained 2%.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Invisalign maker Align stocks surge 8% after earnings blow past estimates
              
              Align Technology Inc. shares  surged 9% Friday to lead S&P 500 gainers, after the maker of Invisalign dental braces blew past second-quarter earnings estimates. San Jose, California-based Align said late Thursday it had net income of $69.2 million, or $85 cents a share, in the quarter,  up from $50.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $356.5 million from $176.9 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 72 cents and revenue of $344 million. North American shipments rose 27.6% while international shipments jumped 37%. The company said Invisalign shipments to the teen market rose 37.6%, after hitting a milestone of 1 million teen patients.  The company said it now expects net revenue of $355 million to $360 million in the third quarter, and EPS of 78 cents to 81 cents. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $359 million. Leerink analysts welcomed the progress made in the key teen market. "Our recent diligence suggests that orthodontists see Invisalign potentially capable of addressing 60+% of their Teen cases, which would be well-above our 8% estimated penetration into Align's North American teen TAM ("fully loaded" ~3.94M cases) by 2020," they wrote in a note. Align shares have gained 77% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
First Hawaiian Bank, their employees, and the First Hawaiian Foundation together represent one of the largest corporate contributors in Hawaii, Guam and CNMI, annually donating more than $3 million to over 400 charitable organizations. Employees are given time off to provide much-needed support at community events.
In 2016, Community Care employee volunteer activities were designed to bring “Comfort & Joy” to those in the community – children, the elderly, and those in need. From October to December, more than 400 employees, family and friends, volunteered hundreds of hours on Oahu, Maui, the Big Island and Kauai.
First Hawaiian Bank's 2016 Kokua Mai campaign raised a record $1 million for charities in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. A remarkable 99 percent of employees made personal donations and 100 percent of every employee contribution goes to their charity of choice.
History[edit]
In 1858, local businessmen, Charles R. Bishop (who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier) and William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in "Makee & Anthon's Building" on Kaahumanu Street. On the day Bishop & Co. opened, it took in $4,784.25 in deposits. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies. [2]

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
First Hawaiian Bank, their employees, and the First Hawaiian Foundation together represent one of the largest corporate contributors in Hawaii, Guam and CNMI, annually donating more than $3 million to over 400 charitable organizations. Employees are given time off to provide much-needed support at community events.
In 2016, Community Care employee volunteer activities were designed to bring “Comfort & Joy” to those in the community – children, the elderly, and those in need. From October to December, more than 400 employees, family and friends, volunteered hundreds of hours on Oahu, Maui, the Big Island and Kauai.
First Hawaiian Bank's 2016 Kokua Mai campaign raised a record $1 million for charities in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. A remarkable 99 percent of employees made personal donations and 100 percent of every employee contribution goes to their charity of choice.
History[edit]
In 1858, local businessmen, Charles R. Bishop (who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier) and William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in "Makee & Anthon's Building" on Kaahumanu Street. On the day Bishop & Co. opened, it took in $4,784.25 in deposits. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies. [2]

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
First Hawaiian Bank, their employees, and the First Hawaiian Foundation together represent one of the largest corporate contributors in Hawaii, Guam and CNMI, annually donating more than $3 million to over 400 charitable organizations. Employees are given time off to provide much-needed support at community events.
In 2016, Community Care employee volunteer activities were designed to bring “Comfort & Joy” to those in the community – children, the elderly, and those in need. From October to December, more than 400 employees, family and friends, volunteered hundreds of hours on Oahu, Maui, the Big Island and Kauai.
First Hawaiian Bank's 2016 Kokua Mai campaign raised a record $1 million for charities in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. A remarkable 99 percent of employees made personal donations and 100 percent of every employee contribution goes to their charity of choice.
History[edit]
In 1858, local businessmen, Charles R. Bishop (who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier) and William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in "Makee & Anthon's Building" on Kaahumanu Street. On the day Bishop & Co. opened, it took in $4,784.25 in deposits. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies. [2]

French bank BNP Paribas SA is launching an initial public offering for its First Hawaiian Bank unit, a debut that could become one of the largest in recent years for a U.S. bank. First Hawaiian has 62 branches and had assets of $19.1 billion on March 31, the bank said in its filing Friday, according to a filing by holding company First Hawaiian Inc. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that the bank was planning to raise roughly $1 billion in an IPO that could value it between $4 billion and $5 billion. First Hawaiian's IPO could be one of the year's largest. The market recovered in the second quarter after a first quarter that marked the slowest period for U.S. IPOs since 2009. Food-service distributor US Foods Holding Corp. raised $1.02 billion in its May debut, putting it in second place for the year after MGM Growth Properties LLC, a real-estate investment trust that raised $1.21 billion in its April offering. Underwriters for First Hawaiian's IPO include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BofA Merrill Lynch and BNP Paribas. The bank filed to offer $100 million, but that is a placeholder amount likely to change. BNP Paribas said in December that it was considering strategic alternatives for First Hawaiian Bank, potentially including an IPO. BNP Paribas said June 30 that it was forming a U.S. holding company, reflecting its commitment to the U.S. market. Its holdings also include California-based Bank of the West. First Hawaiian Inc. plans to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol FHB. The company said its net income last year was $213.8 million, down 1% from 2014. Fitch Ratings affirmed First Hawaiian Bank's viability rating of "a-" last month, reflecting its "superior earnings profile, solid capital and liquidity levels, and good asset quality." -- Maureen Farrell and Telis Demos contributed to this article.

Corporate Responsibility[edit]
First Hawaiian Bank, their employees, and the First Hawaiian Foundation together represent one of the largest corporate contributors in Hawaii, Guam and CNMI, annually donating more than $3 million to over 400 charitable organizations. Employees are given time off to provide much-needed support at community events.
In 2016, Community Care employee volunteer activities were designed to bring “Comfort & Joy” to those in the community – children, the elderly, and those in need. From October to December, more than 400 employees, family and friends, volunteered hundreds of hours on Oahu, Maui, the Big Island and Kauai.
First Hawaiian Bank's 2016 Kokua Mai campaign raised a record $1 million for charities in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. A remarkable 99 percent of employees made personal donations and 100 percent of every employee contribution goes to their charity of choice.
History[edit]
In 1858, local businessmen, Charles R. Bishop (who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier) and William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in "Makee & Anthon's Building" on Kaahumanu Street. On the day Bishop & Co. opened, it took in $4,784.25 in deposits. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies. [2]

Mastercard welcomes UK court ruling to block $18 billion class action suitMastercard Inc.   on Friday welcomed a decision by a U.K. court to block a 14 billion pound ($18 billion) class action suit against the company that alleged it had overcharged more than 45 million Britons over a 16-year stretch. The Competition Appeal Tribunal sided with the card issuer, which argued that the claims were unsuitable to be brought under a collective actions regime. "We welcome the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgment refusing certification for the proposed collective action," the company said in a statement. The suit was brought by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, and centered on interchange fees, which are charged to the banks of merchants that accept MasterCard debit and credit cards. The firm alleged that Mastercard had set fees at too high a level. Mastercard shares were up 0.6% and have gained 25% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average   has gained 9%.

First Hawaiian Bank Raises $485 Million in IPO | Fortune.comFinanceSearchSearchWells FargoWells Fargo May Have Charged 500,000 Clients for Unwanted InsuranceBrainstorm HealthBrainstorm Health Daily: July 28, 2017COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDthe moment amplifiedHow a Moment of Doubt Changed FoursquareDonald Miralle/ Getty Images/ FileIPOsFirst Hawaiian Bank Raises $485 Million in IPOReutersAug 03, 2016First Hawaiian, the Honolulu-based bank controlled by France's BNP Paribas SA (bnpqy), said on Wednesday it had raised $485 million in an initial public offering (IPO), giving it a market valuation of about $3.21 billion.The IPO of Hawaii's oldest bank is the largest bank IPO in the United States since Royal Bank of Scotland Group (rbspf) spun off Citizens Financial (cfg)  in September 2014.It is also the largest IPO in the financial sector since investment company Tekla World Healthcare Fund's $580 million IPO last June.Subscribe to Term Sheet, Fortune's daily email about deals and deal-makers.First Hawaiian said it had sold 21.1 million shares at $23 a share, the top of its $21-$23 range, confirming an earlier Reuters story.A spokesperson for First Hawaiian did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The company will list its common shares tomorrow on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol "FHB."Bank IPOs have been few and far between since the industry saw a spate of them in 2014, as the IPO market for banks reopened following the financial crisis.There were fourteen bank IPOs in 2014 in the United States and only four in 2013 and seven in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.First Hawaiian's offering is the banking sector's third U.S. IPO this year. Paragon Commercial raised $25 million in June and Midland States Bancorp raised roughly $73 million in May.See also: IPO Market Is Worst Since the Financial CrisisAll the shares being sold in the First Hawaiian IPO are coming from BNP Paribas, which will be left with a roughly 85% stake in the company. As a result, the proceeds from the IPO will go to BNP Paribas.In December, BNP Paribas said it was looking at "strategic options" for First Hawaiian as part of its plans to improve its finances and to respond to new and costly regulatory requirements.First Hawaiian, which was founded in 1858 as Bishop & Company, has more than $19 billion of assets and operates 62 branches throughout Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Hawaii, its primary customer base, accounts for 83% of its deposits and 70% of its loans.See also: What Trump and Clinton's Economic Plans Would Mean for AmericaBNP acquired a 45% stake in First Hawaiian when the French bank's subsidiary, BancWest Corporation, merged with First Hawaiian in a $1 billion deal in 1998. It later bought the remaining 55% of shares.First Hawaiian's net income inched up to $54.9 million in the quarter ended June 30 from $54.6 million a year earlier. On a per share basis, profit was flat at 39 cents.Goldman Sachs (gs), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (bac), and BNP Paribas are among the underwriters for the offering.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of common 
stock being sold in this offering, including the sale of any shares pursuant to
the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. All of the shares in 
this offering are being sold by the BNPP selling stockholder. All proceeds from
the sale of these shares, net of underwriters' discounts and offering expenses 
payable by the BNPP selling stockholder, will be received by the BNPP selling 
stockholder, a subsidiary of BNPP.


The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of the institutions
we compete against also have deep roots in Hawaii and have developed 
long-standing reputations in the communities they serve. Within our branch 
footprint, we primarily face competition from regional banks that have 
established branch networks throughout the islands, giving them visible retail
presence to customers; however, we also compete with national financial
institutions that operate in our market areas. Competition among providers of
financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the
opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional 
alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide 
services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition.

In consumer banking, we primarily compete with local banks that have visible 
retail presence and personnel in our market areas. The primary factors driving 
competition in consumer banking are customer service, interest rates, fees 
charged, branch location and hours of operation and the range of products 
offered. We compete for deposits by advertising, offering competitive interest
rates and seeking to provide a higher level of personal service. Our wealth
management business faces competition from both non-bank brokerage firms and
larger financial institution brokerage businesses.

In commercial banking, we face competition to source loans to healthy, stable 
businesses at competitive price levels that make sense for our business. Some 
competitors may offer a wider variety of products, or may specialize in an 
industry that allows them to provide a concentrated focus that is not part of
our business model. Our major commercial bank competitors include large
financial institutions, including national and international financial
institutions, that may have the ability to bid on larger commercial real estate
and construction projects than we can bid on. Our regional competitors may have
aggressive pricing and unique terms. We compete on a number of factors
including, among others, customer service, range of products offered, price,
reputation, quality of execution and relative lending limits pertaining to
commercial borrowers.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware and
headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. Our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First
Hawaiian Bank, was founded in 1858 under the name Bishop & Company and was the
first successful banking partnership in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the


 second
oldest bank formed west of the Mississippi River. Today, First Hawaiian Bank is
the largest full service bank headquartered in Hawaii as measured by assets,
loans, deposits and net income. As of March 31, 2016, we had $19.1 billion of
assets, $11.0 billion of gross loans, $16.1 billion of deposits and $2.5 billion
of stockholder's equity, and we generated $65.5 million of net income for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 and $213.8 million of net income for the year
ended December 31, 2015. We generated $51.1 million of core net income for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 and $196.3 million of core net income for the
year ended December 31, 2015.(1)

We have a highly diversified and balanced loan portfolio that has exhibited
steady organic loan growth through various economic cycles. Gross loans have
grown at a 6.1% compound annual growth rate since December 31, 2005, and loan
balances have increased every year since 2005 despite the Great Recession (which
we define as January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009) and strong competition.
We believe the strength and credit quality of our loan portfolio reflects our
conservative credit-driven underwriting approach. We also have the leading
deposit market share position across our branch footprint. As of June 30, 2015,
we had a 36.5% deposit market share in Hawaii, a 34.9% deposit market share in
Guam and a 38.4% deposit market share in Saipan according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").

Hawaii has been, and will continue to be, our primary market. As of March 31, 
2016, 83% of our deposits and 70% of our loans were based in Hawaii and, for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2016, 72% of our originated loan commitments were 
in Hawaii. Hawaii is an attractive market that we believe will continue to 
provide steady organic growth opportunities. We pride ourselves on our deep 
rooted and extensive relationships within the Hawaii community. We believe these
community ties coupled with the strength of our brand and market share provide 
an excellent long-term opportunity to continue to deliver steady growth, stable
operating efficiency and consistently strong performance.

Through First Hawaiian Bank, we operate a network of 62 branches in Hawaii
(57 branches), Guam (3 branches) and Saipan (2 branches). We provide a
diversified range of banking services to consumer and commercial customers,
including deposit products, lending services and wealth management and trust
services. Through our distribution channels, we offer a variety of deposit
products to our customers, including checking and savings accounts and other
types of deposit accounts. We offer comprehensive commercial banking services to
middle market and large Hawaii-based businesses with over $10 million of
revenue, strong balance sheets and high quality collateral. We provide
commercial and industrial lending, including auto dealer flooring, commercial
real estate and construction lending. Our commercial lending teams and
relationship managers are highly experienced and maintain relationships across a
diversified range of industries, including retail trade, real estate, 
manufacturing, information services and transportation. We offer comprehensive 
consumer lending services focused on mortgage lending, indirect auto financing 
and other consumer loans to individuals and small businesses through our branch,
online and mobile distribution channels. Our wealth management business provides
an array of trust services, private banking and investment management services.
We also offer consumer and commercial credit cards and merchant processing.

We seek to develop comprehensive, long-term banking relationships by offering a
diverse array of products and services, cross-selling those products and 
services and delivering high quality customer service. Our service culture and 
emphasis on repeat positive customer experiences are integral to our banking
strategy and exemplified by our longstanding customer relationships.

(1) Core net income is a non-GAAP measure.
