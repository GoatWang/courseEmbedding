        Jamie Piper is a commercial animal photographer who creates modern, authentic, engaging images that help her clients get away from the 'stock-y' look. Images that help their customers fall in love with whatever product or service they are selling, in whatever form or media they are selling it in.
       


        Since the inception of her business Cowbelly Photography in 2003, Jamie has worked with pet insurance companies, pet pharma companies, pet product companies, pet industry magazines, dog-friendly hotels, and lots of dog food companies. Additionally she works with any and all companies who combine domestic animals with people in their shoots.
       


        Based in San Diego CA, Jamie loves Southern California for its gorgeous golden light, but is no stranger to travel and has done commissioned photo shoots in 18 different cities around the U.S. (She can work in Seattle and L.A. as a local).
       


        If you or your clients are in need of modern, engaging, high-quality pet images that connect with their audience and help them SELL, Jamie Piper is your photographer. Get in touch!
