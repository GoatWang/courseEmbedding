Terra Tech ramps up marketing campaign for Edible Garden brand
IRVINE, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 07/20/17 --  Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) ("Terra Tech" or the "Company"), announced today it is ramping up its marketing campaign for its subsidiary, Edible Garden®, a provider of fresh, locally grown herbs and leafy greens nationwide. As part of the Company's new marketing campaign, Edible Garden has secured a feature slot for its nutritionally-enhanced SUPERLEAF™ salad on the television show 'Plant Based by Nafsika', on A&E's FYI Channel at 7:30 am ET on July 26, 2017. In addition to being featured in the episode, Edible Garden will also air commercials during the program's advertisement breaks. The exposure to Plant Based by Nafsika's audience is expected to increase brand recognition among Edible Garden's core target customer base in the healthy living sector. 
Edible Garden was established in 2007 and utilizes time-tested, advanced Dutch hydroponic farming methods to grow fresh produce in a safe and healthy environment. Founded on the importance of providing consumers with healthy and natural products, Edible Garden has developed into a national brand grown by a co-op of local growers. Its products are 100% natural, USDA Certified Organic and Non-GMO Project Verified. Plant Based by Nafsika, the world's first vegan lifestyle series, will showcase Edible Garden's produce in the first episode of season 2. Plant Based by Nafsika engages its viewers through plant-based cooking demonstrations and interactive segments. It features various celebrity guests, fashion icons, and nutritional gurus sharing, incorporating and exploring the exciting aspects of living a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. For more information visit: http://plantbasedbynafsika.com/
Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech Corp., commented, "Edible Garden is focused on producing innovative, all natural products while maintaining a strong commitment to integrity during the production process and I am looking forward to seeing its produce featured on Nafsika's vegan lifestyle program, which is watched by healthy-living enthusiasts around the country. We have worked hard to expand Edible Garden's range of fresh herbs and greens, which includes "living" produce with the root system still intact, as well as cut lettuce and our nutritionally-enhanced SUPERLEAF salad. All products are 100% natural and certified by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), an industry driven global collaborative platform to advance food safety. Our commitment to research and innovation, and our sustainable production practices, means there is no competition when it comes to the quality, sustainability and integrity of Edible Garden products. We are delighted to see Edible Garden continue to gain traction as we invest in our marketing efforts and improve brand recognition."

 Here is where the product comes from IMHO     Notice IVXX powered by Moxie........licence deal apparently..   Grower   BAM  Deep Roots Harvest  Evergreen Organix  GLP  IVXX  IVXX Powered By Moxie  Moxie   http://www.letsblum.com/las-vegas-western/products   no implication the filing shows inventory as well.........IMHO   I am just frustrated with their "plan of action"......back in 2014 the CEO went over how the margins would be great as seed to sale and was timing their cultivation sites to be ready for recreational sales......   They have been planning this since 2014 and knew they needed 8 million since 2014 and share holders stepped up to the plate and gave them over 50 million dollars.........none of which went to cultivation in Nevada.

Expands Cannabis Cultivation Capabilities in Northern California with New "Craft Cultivation" ModelMarketwiredMay 24, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareIRVINE, CA--(Marketwired - May 24, 2017) -  Terra Tech Corp. (TRTC) ("Terra Tech" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company, today announced that it has launched a new "Craft Cultivation" model to expand its cultivation capabilities, signing its first "Craft Cultivator" in Northern California. This farm, which is approved for up to one full acre (approximately 44,000 square feet) of cannabis cultivation and uses 22,000 square feet of engineered greenhouse space, is estimated to yield approximately one metric ton of the Company's proprietary high grade "IVXX" cannabis on an annual basis.Terra Tech has executed a one-year lease and operating contract with Panther Gap Farms, with the option to renew both the one-year lease and the operating contract a further three times in the following years. The property is located in Honeydew, CA, in Southern Humboldt County, in an area known as the "Emerald Triangle" that is home to some of the world's highest quality cannabis products. Terra Tech is adopting a responsible, sustainable and all-natural cultivation methodology to ensure its proprietary IVXX strains are carefully selected and grown to minimize risks to people and the environment.Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech Corp., commented, "We are proud to be implementing environmentally sustainable practices, and operating in a region and on an isolated site that lends itself to contaminant-free cultivation. Each Craft Cultivator is hand selected because of their unique ability to produce high quality product using sustainable farming practices. Working with artisanal growers and using an all-natural cultivation methodology aligns with our commitment to producing premium quality cannabis products for our customers. We are pleased to expand our cultivation footprint while allowing IVXX to elevate in both quality and consistency. This extension of our cultivation capabilities into the Emerald Triangle, home to some of the world's finest cannabis, will help us to expand both the Company's product line and margins over the coming year."Salwa Ibrahim commented, "Humboldt County was the first of California's 58 Counties to issue a cannabis cultivation ordinance in compliance with MCRSA. The County has very effectively developed its regulations to protect and preserve the community and ecology of Humboldt County while also supporting the legal cannabis industry and helping it to flourish responsibly in a regulated environment. We are excited at the prospect of cultivating cannabis in this region."IVXX cannabis is grown and harvested under the safest and most beneficial conditions, free of toxic pesticides, harmful molds and chemical residues. All products are thoughtfully produced, rigorously tested and certified to the highest standards of potency and purity.The project is fully compliant with the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act ("MCRSA"), the California Department of Fish & Wildlife and the Humboldt County Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Ordinance. Additionally, the property is registered with the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, and is one of only 15 cannabis businesses enrolled in the Humboldt County Medical Cannabis Track and Trace pilot program.To be added to the Terra Tech email distribution list, please email TRTC@kcsa.com with TRTC in the subject line.About Terra TechTerra Tech Corp.

Words such as "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "intend" and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the company's business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and probably will, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including those described above and those risks discussed from time to time in Terra Tech Corp.'s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, such statements could be affected by risks and uncertainties related to Terra Tech Corp.'s (i) product demand, market and customer acceptance of its equipment and other goods, (ii) ability to obtain financing to expand its operations, (iii) ability to attract qualified sales representatives, (iv) competition, pricing and development difficulties, (v) ability to integrate GrowOp Technology Ltd. into its operations as a reporting issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (vi) general industry and market conditions and growth rates and general economic conditions. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release. Information on Terra Tech Corp.'s website does not constitute a part of this release.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThere's way too much weed in CaliforniaBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredRacially charged 'Detroit' is story that needed telling, Bigelow saysReutersHow California Can Make Use Of Its Surplus MarijuanaInternational Business TimesLate Morris goal delivers U.S. sixth Gold Cup championshipReutersDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredHow Jeff Sessions Could Crack Down on Legal Marijuana (And Why He Might Not)TimeThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business Insider3 Must-Own Stocks in 2017Banyan HillSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekNever Buy Options [Do This Instead]Investing DailySponsoredAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone park cracks down on sex harassmentAssociated PressTrump names John F.
