Welcome to Plutopian


































Plutopian Corporation is developing a new cooperative data platform to power
the next generation of marketing analytics for the retail financial industry.




About the Founder 












About the Founder

Plutopian Corporation is led by Sam Barton, who synthesizes a wealth of experience as a leading practitioner and entrepreneur in the fields of wealth metrics, market segmentation, database marketing, geodemographic targeting, and syndicated survey research.


In the 1980s, Mr. Barton served as President of Claritas Corporation, building the company to become the dominant first-generation provider of wealth metrics data solutions. In the early stages, he led the company’s development and commercialization of PRIZM, the nation’s first neighborhood lifestyle classification model. He later broadened the company’s offerings by developing numerous geodemographic targeted marketing systems for consumer marketers, including a neighborhood wealth estimation model for financial institutions. Mr. Barton left Claritas following its acquisition in the late 1980s by VNU (now Nielsen).


In the mid-1990s, Mr. Barton co-founded IXI Corporation, introducing the disruptive methodology that defined the second-generation wealth metrics solution that the financial industry uses today: a system for measuring neighborhood wealth by pooling and aggregating consumer deposit and investment data from the nation’s leading financial institutions. In the startup years, Mr. Barton led the development and consolidation of the company’s data provider network. He then focused primarily on developing database applications in customer wealth scoring and prospect generation. Mr. Barton retired from IXI in 2004 after serving for ten years as the company’s Chairman and CEO. IXI was acquired in 2009 by Equifax.


Over the last few years, and following a breakthrough in thinking, Mr. Barton has been developing a new approach to consumer data integration that has the potential to revolutionize the field of wealth metrics and power significant productivity gains for sales and marketing teams at retail financial institutions.

Above table reports Labor Condition Application(LCA) for H1B visa and Labor Certification(LC) for green card filed by Plutopian Corporation. The data only indicates the number of applications filed by Plutopian Corporation. It does not mean that Plutopian Corporation actually got the visa and hired the workers.Our LCA data includes LCA submitted for not only new employment, but also continuation or change in previously approved employment, new concurrent employment, change in employer and amended petition. Usually, only LCA for new employment needs H1B Visa quota if it is not cap-exempt. Plutopian Corporation has applied for 1 LC and LCA from fiscal year 2014 to 2016. But this does not mean they really hired 1 foreign workers during this period. The visa applications might have been denied. When an employee renews or transfers his H1B visa or change work location under some circumstances, he will also file a new LCA application. Department of Labor(DOL) typically certifies more than 3 times the number of foreign work requests than the number of H1B visas issued by USCIS. So there is no one to one relationship between the number of workers certified by the DOL and the number of H1B work visas issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
