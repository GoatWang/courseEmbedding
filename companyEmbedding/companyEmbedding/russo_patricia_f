Patricia F. Russo (born June 12, 1952, in Trenton, New Jersey is an American businessperson.[1] Russo is most widely known for having served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lucent Technologies, and its successor, Alcatel-Lucent, a large communications equipment manufacturer. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of General Motors, Merck & Co., and Arconic, Inc. She serves as Chairwoman of the nonprofit organization, Partnership at Drugfree.org. Prior to the split of Hewlett-Packard into two companies in 2015, Russo served as Lead Independent Director. She now serves as Chairwoman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.[2]
Forbes Magazine rated Russo as 10th on its List of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2006.[3]
Career at Lucent[edit]
Russo joined Lucent's predecessor in 1982.[4] In 1992, she became President of the Business Communications Systems division, moving in 1997 to become the Executive Vice President (VP) of Corporate Operations, and in 1999 to Executive VP and CEO of the Service Provider Networks Group.[4] She left in August 2000, after a reorganization; however, returned in January 2002 to become the CEO.[4] After "cutting costs and focusing on sales of wireless equipment, Russo was credited with returning Lucent to profitability in 2004, after three years of red ink."[3] However, profits that year "came largely through slashes in spending, cuts to retiree benefits, and reductions in research-and-development budgets that spurred protests."[5]
On April 2, 2006, it was announced that Russo would assume the CEO role of a new combined company resulting from the merger of the French communications company Alcatel and Lucent.[citation needed] This merger became effective on December 1, 2006. When Russo became the CEO of the combined company, Serge Tchuruk, the former CEO of Alcatel, remained as chairman.
The newly combined entity failed to turn a profit, and as a result, the company's management team resorted to rounds of restructuring and layoffs to address what were considered "challenging market conditions".[6] The board eventually decided to oust the management team, and on July 29, 2008, Russo, along with Alcatel-Lucent chairman Serge Tchuruk, announced that she would step down by the end of 2008, in a broad-reaching management restructuring.[7] Significant changes in the composition of the company's board were also announced. Alcatel-Lucent shares had lost more than 60% of their value since the merger.[7]
In the statement released by Alcatel-Lucent relating to her departure, Russo was quoted as saying, "The company will benefit from new leadership aligned with a newly composed board to bring a fresh and independent perspective that will take Alcatel-Lucent to its next level of growth and development in a rapidly changing global market.".[8] On September 2, 2008, she was replaced by Ben Verwaayen.
Other activities[edit]
Russo spent nine months as the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of Eastman Kodak, a position she left in January 2002 when she returned to Lucent to become their CEO.[4] She was also Chairwoman of Avaya, which was spun off from Lucent. Avaya, however, filed for bankruptcy in January 2017.[9]
On July 23, 2009, General Motors announced that Russo would be a member of the company's new Board of Directors.[10]

      ■ Patricia Russo rose through the ranks of the telecommunications
      giant AT&T and helped launch its spin-off company, Lucent
      Technologies. Lucent developed into a leading supplier of communications
      hardware, software, and services, riding the telecommunications boom of
      the late 1990s. When the telecom bubble burst, Russo left Lucent to take
      the number two spot at Eastman Kodak. Her reign there was short; in less
      than a year she returned to tend to the beleaguered Lucent. After taking
      over as president and CEO, she resolutely cut costs and trimmed staff in
      order to improve the company's financial outlook and restore
      consumer confidence.
    

      Reporters and colleagues alternately described Russo as conservative and
      dynamic. In the 
      
        Calgary Herald
      
       she said of herself, "I'm deliberate, and I believe in
      letting people who

          . 
        


      have a stake in things weigh in. But I wouldn't call that cautious;
      I'll make the decisions we need to make" (June 16, 2003).
    

      THE EARLY YEARS
    

      Russo grew up in a large middle-class family in a New Jersey suburb. A
      natural athlete, she was cocaptain of her high school basketball team and
      captain of the cheerleading squad. After graduating from Georgetown
      University with a degree in political science and history, she joined the
      sales and marketing department at International Business Machines (IBM).
      She was there for eight years and eventually rose to the position of
      marketing manager.
    

      Even when she was just starting out in the business world, Russo dared to
      tread on territory where few women had ventured.
       When she joined IBM, she was one of the only women selling mainframes.
      "Early in my career there were some people who didn't
      believe a woman belonged in sales," she told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      ; "but I worked hard on the accounts I was given and made sure I
      met the customers' needs and focused on producing results for the
      company. What I found is that results matter—it's hard to
      argue with them. People who produce results rise to the top" (May
      29, 2003).
    

      MOVING UP THROUGH THE RANKS OF AT&T AND LUCENT
    

      Russo was hired by AT&T in 1981 and quickly began moving up within
      the ranks of the sales and marketing departments. In 1992 she was called
      upon to overhaul the company's struggling Global Business
      Communications Systems. She focused the division's efforts on voice
      systems, improved its core products, cut costs, and spurred overseas
      expansion. Through these efforts she was able to stem huge financial
      losses and boost revenues by 43 percent, to $5.7 billion, transforming the
      unit from a money bleeder into a clear profit maker.
    

      Russo was still with AT&T when the telecommunications giant decided
      to spin-off its equipment division in 1996; Lucent Technologies was born.
      In 1999 she became executive vice president and chairwoman of
      Lucent's $24 billion Service Provider Networks Group, a position
      that placed Russo in charge of 80,000 employees.
    

      Although Russo's career was going strong, her company would soon
      face rough roads. In 2000 Lucent began a sharp downturn;
      telecommunications spending had dropped, and the company's sales
      and stock prices suffered as a result. Most of the blame for the
      company's troubles was placed on the CEO Richard McGinn. To stop
      the bleeding, he began to spin off Lucent divisions; in the end virtually
      all that was left was Russo's Service Provider Networks, which
      McGinn brought under the corporate umbrella, essentially squeezing Russo
      out. Experts say her reduced role, the constant infighting between McGinn
      and his staff, and McGinn's questionable accounting practices (he
      allegedly reported revenue on sales that were not final) ultimately drove
      Russo out the door in August 2000.
    

      A CAREER SHIFT
    

      Russo enjoyed a brief period of time off, painting and catching up on
      sleep. In April 2001 she found herself back on the corporate fast track
      when Eastman Kodak wooed her to its Rochester, New York, headquarters with
      the offer of its number two slot. She became president and chief operating
      officer, the highest position ever attained by a woman at that company.
      Management hired her because of her track record and because it was hoped
      her technological expertise would help Kodak modernize from film to
      digital imaging. The chairman Daniel Carp said in 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       that she brought skills to exactly where the company needed
      them—"right in the sweet spot" (April 23, 2001). She
      was charged with helping the film and photo company integrate its imaging
      products with the latest technologies, overseeing the day-to-day functions
      of the operating divisions, and seeking out new business opportunities.
    

      While Russo tended to Kodak, her former employer was ailing. Excess
      network capacity left over from the Internet boom combined with lagging
      consumer demand were taking their toll on the telecom industry as a whole.
      Lucent's customers—telephone and wireless
      companies—were themselves suffering from slow sales and as a result
      cut back on their equipment purchases. In 2001 Lucent reported a $16.2
      billion net loss; the value of its stock had fallen nearly 50 percent
      within a single year. Lucent management was in a state of upheaval. McGinn
      had been let go in October 2000, with Henry Schacht serving as interim CEO
      and trying to find a replacement. He eventually turned his attention to
      Russo.
    

      A QUICK RETURN
    

      Less than one year after she had left, Russo returned to Lucent, taking
      over as CEO on January 7, 2002; she asked Schacht to stay on as her senior
      advisor. She was reportedly lured back with an attractive compensation
      package: a $1.2 million salary plus a $1.8 million bonus package and 4.7
      million stock options. When she returned, she told the Associated Press,
      "It's like coming home" (January 8, 2002). At the
      time Russo was one of only six female CEOs running Fortune 500 companies.
      And, just like Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox,
      Russo was put in charge of a company in crisis.
    

      The company had spun off its Agere Systems Unit, which produced integrated
      circuits and optical-electronics systems, and Avaya (formerly Business
      Communications, which she had run), supplier of office-telephone and
      voice-messaging systems. In 2002 capital spending by phone companies in
      the United States fell 38 percent. As a result Lucent was struggling in a
      sea of debt. Thus, being named Lucent CEO "wasn't like
      inheriting a world championship team," Steve Kamman, an executive
      director at CIBC World Markets, told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       (May 29, 2003).
    

      The response to Russo's return was mixed. Some industry insiders
      predicted that she would boost sagging company morale. Company leaders
      felt that her insider status and familiarity with Lucent's products
      would facilitate her helping the company return to profitability. In a
      statement in 
      
        Network World
      
      , Schacht said, "Pat brings deep knowledge of our industry and our
      customers, coupled with the ability to lead a large organization through
      change. She understands and embraces our strategic and restructuring
      plans, and she can step in as CEO without missing a beat" (January
      7, 2002).
    

      But some analysts were concerned that her return simply signaled a
      reemergence of Lucent's old bureaucratic ways, an unfavorable
      reminder of the AT&T days. "I'm concerned that the
      management team at Lucent is heavily concentrated with people who have
      been there for 10 to 15 years," the Lehman Brothers analyst Steve
      Levy told 
      
        Telephony
      
       (January 14, 2002).
    

      Even as pressure mounted, Russo maintained her composure. Stephanie Mehta
      of 
      
        Fortune
      
       commented on her "flawless posture and the way she chooses her
      words. She comes across as well prepared and in command" (April 15,
      2002). Although she was known and respected for her firm leadership, she
      also had a softer side that she was quick to exhibit in the company of
      friends and employees. She reportedly carried chocolate, a favorite food,
      wherever she went in order to prove that she was a real person.
    

      Russo was determined to turn Lucent around and show a profit by September
      2003 (she later had to revise her estimate to 2004). Her first order of
      business was to execute the turnaround plan that Schacht had drafted,
      which focused on the sales of Lucent products to
      wireless-telecommunication companies (such as AT&T and Verizon
      Wireless) and Internet service providers. Lucent faced a lot of
      competition in that arena, however, from companies such as Cisco Systems
      and Ciena Corporation.
    

      Russo set to work reducing operating expenses, vendor-financing
      commitments, and working capital. The reduction of expenses necessitated
      spinning or selling off businesses that no longer fit within the
      company's sharpened focus. Another more difficult part of reducing
      expenses was the cutting of staff. By the time Russo took charge, the
      company had already trimmed the number of employees by nearly half
      (removing about 44,000 jobs). Russo would oversee thousands more layoffs.
    

      In an effort to return to profitability, Lucent began to reshift its focus
      from simply providing equipment to the telecommunications industry to
      providing customer-centric services. Rather than just promote the
      company's existing products, Lucent asked customers what they
      wanted and designed offerings accordingly. The new Lucent offered a wide
      range of services, from installation to network optimization and
      outsourcing. The company began looking at establishing new
      partnerships—some even with rivals. In May 2003 Lucent signed a
      deal to resell products produced by its competitor Juniper Networks.
    

      Russo also focused on the company's strongest moneymaking
      potential: its sales force. "In many ways I am Lucent's
      chief salesperson. Now more than ever, an experienced, creative, and
      committed sales team is absolutely critical to our turnaround and success
      going forward," she told 
      
        Sales and Marketing Management
      
       (November 1, 2002).
    

      It was not surprising that Russo so aggressively pursued sales, as she was
      well known for her competitiveness. Colleagues had reportedly asked her
      not to participate in golf and tennis matches on corporate retreats
      because she tended to win every game. In 2002 
      
        Golf Digest
      
       ranked her among the top 100 CEO golfers in the country.
    

      Despite Russo's efforts, in October 2002 Lucent's market
      position had not improved. The company posted its 10th straight quarterly
      loss, to the tune of $2.88 billion. Its stock, which had soared to more
      than $80 a share in 1999, had subsequently plunged more than 90 percent to
      less than a dollar. Standard & Poor's dropped
      Lucent's credit rating, which was already considered junk. Some
      investors talked about the possibility of bankruptcy, a suggestion Russo
      and other company executives quickly dismissed. She told the 
      
        Boston Globe
      
      , "When this storm is over, we expect to be a leader"
      (October 12, 2002).
    

      WEATHERING THE STORM
    

      In February 2003 Russo was named chairwoman of Lucent; after a tough
      couple of years, things were starting to look up for the beleaguered
      company. Eight months later in October Lucent reported a profit for the
      first time in three years. Although she admitted the company would
      probably still have its financial ups and downs, Russo announced that
      Lucent was finished downsizing (having reduced the number of employees
      from the 150,000 of three years before to about 35,000) and would not lay
      off any additional staff. "We have weathered the storm," she
      told the Associated Press (October 22, 2003).
    

      Russo sat on the boards of Schering-Plough Corporation, Xerox Corporation,
      New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, and her alma mater, Georgetown
      University. In addition to her degrees from Georgetown and Harvard, Russo
      received an honorary doctorate in entrepreneurial studies from Columbia
      College in South Carolina.

 1 Kristina BarnellOct 19, 2006 @ 12:00 amIn another article I read about Patricia Russo it said that she was born June 12, 1952. Your article just says "1953." So since the other article has the exact date, to me, they are more believable. If you want me to believe your article over someone else's, I suggest that you put a little more information about the exact date of birth. 2 Stephan CyriacusSep 13, 2007 @ 6:06 amyour info stopped 2003, what about updating such an important biography or did you die four years ago?

Interpretation 












Russo, Patricia F.

▪ 2005

      In 2004 Patricia Russo, CEO of telecommunications firm Lucent Technologies, accomplished what few had expected. One of the most widely held stocks in the late 1990s, Lucent had seen its share price plummet to less than $1 per share by 2002. As business dried up and layoffs and financial losses persisted, the chances of Lucent's recovery seemed slim. It was a bold move, then, for the firm to appoint former Lucent insider Russo as its new CEO in January 2002. Bolder still was Russo's promise to return the company to profitability before the end of 2003, but she kept her word, met that goal, and led Lucent through four profitable quarters in fiscal year 2004.

      Patricia Fiorello Russo was born June 12, 1952, in Trenton, N.J. Among her six siblings were twin brothers with disabilities, and Russo said that growing up with them had helped her learn the lessons of caring for others. She was active in sports and captained the cheerleading squad before graduating from Lawrence High School in 1969. In 1973 she earned a bachelor's degree in political science and history from Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., and moved directly to IBM for an eight-year career in sales and marketing. While with IBM, Russo developed a customer-oriented perspective that would influence her future management style.

      Joining AT&T in 1981, Russo spent the next decade in marketing, human resources, operations, and strategic planning. She completed Harvard University's rigorous Advanced Management Program in 1989, and three years later AT&T chose her to restructure its faltering Business Communications Systems division as its president. Russo's turnaround permitted AT&T to spin off the division as Avaya, Inc. She moved to Lucent in time for its $3 billion initial public offering in 1996, serving as executive vice president for corporate operations (1997–99) and vice president and CEO of Lucent's core business, the service provider networks group (1999–2000). Russo left in 2000 and became president and chief operating officer of Eastman Kodak in April 2001—only to return in 2002 as Lucent's president and CEO. She was elevated to chairman and CEO in February 2003.

      Russo led Lucent on a course of modest but steady growth that emphasized service and customer contact, although the year's profits came largely through slashes in spending, and cuts to retiree benefits and reductions in research-and-development budgets spurred protests. Russo's focus on service was expected to build strong customer ties, but critics feared that Lucent, left to fill gaps in its product lineup by selling competitors' hardware, risked losing its edge in new product development. Even so, the firm chalked up several important contracts in 2004, and the future—for Lucent and Russo—looked bright.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

"Arconic (ARNC) supplied one of our products, Reynobond PE, to our customer, a fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower," said the company in a statement.

Patricia F. Russo (born June 12, 1952, in Trenton, New Jersey is an American businessperson.[1] Russo is most widely known for having served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lucent Technologies, and its successor, Alcatel-Lucent, a large communications equipment manufacturer. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of General Motors, Merck & Co., and Arconic, Inc. She serves as Chairwoman of the nonprofit organization, Partnership at Drugfree.org. Prior to the split of Hewlett-Packard into two companies in 2015, Russo served as Lead Independent Director. She now serves as Chairwoman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.[2]
Forbes Magazine rated Russo as 10th on its List of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2006.[3]
Career at Lucent[edit]
Russo joined Lucent's predecessor in 1982.[4] In 1992, she became President of the Business Communications Systems division, moving in 1997 to become the Executive Vice President (VP) of Corporate Operations, and in 1999 to Executive VP and CEO of the Service Provider Networks Group.[4] She left in August 2000, after a reorganization; however, returned in January 2002 to become the CEO.[4] After "cutting costs and focusing on sales of wireless equipment, Russo was credited with returning Lucent to profitability in 2004, after three years of red ink."[3] However, profits that year "came largely through slashes in spending, cuts to retiree benefits, and reductions in research-and-development budgets that spurred protests."[5]
On April 2, 2006, it was announced that Russo would assume the CEO role of a new combined company resulting from the merger of the French communications company Alcatel and Lucent.[citation needed] This merger became effective on December 1, 2006. When Russo became the CEO of the combined company, Serge Tchuruk, the former CEO of Alcatel, remained as chairman.
The newly combined entity failed to turn a profit, and as a result, the company's management team resorted to rounds of restructuring and layoffs to address what were considered "challenging market conditions".[6] The board eventually decided to oust the management team, and on July 29, 2008, Russo, along with Alcatel-Lucent chairman Serge Tchuruk, announced that she would step down by the end of 2008, in a broad-reaching management restructuring.[7] Significant changes in the composition of the company's board were also announced. Alcatel-Lucent shares had lost more than 60% of their value since the merger.[7]
In the statement released by Alcatel-Lucent relating to her departure, Russo was quoted as saying, "The company will benefit from new leadership aligned with a newly composed board to bring a fresh and independent perspective that will take Alcatel-Lucent to its next level of growth and development in a rapidly changing global market.".[8] On September 2, 2008, she was replaced by Ben Verwaayen.
Other activities[edit]
Russo spent nine months as the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of Eastman Kodak, a position she left in January 2002 when she returned to Lucent to become their CEO.[4] She was also Chairwoman of Avaya, which was spun off from Lucent. Avaya, however, filed for bankruptcy in January 2017.[9]
On July 23, 2009, General Motors announced that Russo would be a member of the company's new Board of Directors.[10]

Russo joined Lucent's predecessor in 1982.[4] In 1992, she became President of the Business Communications Systems division, moving in 1997 to become the Executive Vice President (VP) of Corporate Operations, and in 1999 to Executive VP and CEO of the Service Provider Networks Group.[4] She left in August 2000, after a reorganization; however, returned in January 2002 to become the CEO.[4] After "cutting costs and focusing on sales of wireless equipment, Russo was credited with returning Lucent to profitability in 2004, after three years of red ink."[3] However, profits that year "came largely through slashes in spending, cuts to retiree benefits, and reductions in research-and-development budgets that spurred protests."[5]
On April 2, 2006, it was announced that Russo would assume the CEO role of a new combined company resulting from the merger of the French communications company Alcatel and Lucent.[citation needed] This merger became effective on December 1, 2006. When Russo became the CEO of the combined company, Serge Tchuruk, the former CEO of Alcatel, remained as chairman.
The newly combined entity failed to turn a profit, and as a result, the company's management team resorted to rounds of restructuring and layoffs to address what were considered "challenging market conditions".[6] The board eventually decided to oust the management team, and on July 29, 2008, Russo, along with Alcatel-Lucent chairman Serge Tchuruk, announced that she would step down by the end of 2008, in a broad-reaching management restructuring.[7] Significant changes in the composition of the company's board were also announced. Alcatel-Lucent shares had lost more than 60% of their value since the merger.[7]
In the statement released by Alcatel-Lucent relating to her departure, Russo was quoted as saying, "The company will benefit from new leadership aligned with a newly composed board to bring a fresh and independent perspective that will take Alcatel-Lucent to its next level of growth and development in a rapidly changing global market.".[8] On September 2, 2008, she was replaced by Ben Verwaayen.
Other activities[edit]
Russo spent nine months as the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of Eastman Kodak, a position she left in January 2002 when she returned to Lucent to become their CEO.[4] She was also Chairwoman of Avaya, which was spun off from Lucent. Avaya, however, filed for bankruptcy in January 2017.[9]
On July 23, 2009, General Motors announced that Russo would be a member of the company's new Board of Directors.[10]

Patricia F. Russo (born June 12, 1952, in Trenton, New Jersey is an American businessperson.[1] Russo is most widely known for having served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lucent Technologies, and its successor, Alcatel-Lucent, a large communications equipment manufacturer. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of General Motors, Merck & Co., and Arconic, Inc. She serves as Chairwoman of the nonprofit organization, Partnership at Drugfree.org. Prior to the split of Hewlett-Packard into two companies in 2015, Russo served as Lead Independent Director. She now serves as Chairwoman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.[2]
Forbes Magazine rated Russo as 10th on its List of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2006.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
