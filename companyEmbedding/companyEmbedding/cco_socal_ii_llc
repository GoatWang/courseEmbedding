CommentBefore the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONWashington, J?C 20554In rePetition to Show Cause KJLA, LLCAgainst CCO SoCal I, LLC) ) ) CSR-8775-M ) Docket No. 13-63 ) )To: Office ofthe Secretary Attn: Chief, Media BureauOPPOSITION TO PETITIONCCO SoCal I, LLC ("Charter" or the "Company") hereby opposes the "Petition for Issuance of Order to Show Cause" filed by KJLA, LLC, licensee of KJLA, Ventura, California ("KJLA" or the "Station") in the above-captioned proceeding. 1 The Station does not dispute that Charter is properly carrying KJLA's digital must carry signal in a digital format on its cable systems in the Los Angeles DMA. 2 Rather, it alleges that the Company discontinued carriage of KJLA's signal in analog format in violation of the Commission's 2012 Viewability Order3 by failing to provide adequate notice to either KJLA or its own subscribers. The Station also claims1 The Commission docketed the Station's "Petition for Issuance of Order to Show Cause," as a must carry complaint ("Petition"). See Special Reliefand Show Cause Petitions, Report No. 0392 (March 18, 2013).2 The Petition does not identify particular communities. Instead, it refers broadly to Charter's analog subscribers in the Los Angeles DMA. See, e.g., Petition at 1. This Opposition addresses those communities to which Charter currently retransmits KJLA's signal in digital-only format, including Big Bear Lake, Burbank, Cerritos, Glendale, Hesperia, Long Beach, Malibu, Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Gabriel Valley, Ventura, Victorville, and Whittier (the "Cable Communities").3 Carriage ofDigital Television Broadcast Signals: Amendment to Part 76 ofthe Commission's Rules, Fifth Report and Order, 27 FCC Red. 6529 (2012)("2012 Viewabiliity Order").DWT21458162vl 0108600-000002that Charter has failed to make affordable equipment available that would enable analog subscribers to continue to view stations (such as KJLA) subject to the digital migration. The Station's factual allegations are wrong: Charter properly notified both KJLA and its own subscribers that the Company was terminating analog delivery of KJLA's signal, and it offers digital equipment for continued viewing ofKJLA by analog subscribers free of charge.In the 2012 Viewability Order, the Commission announced the sunset ofthe "viewability" rule, which had required cable operators with hybrid analog/digital systems to carry digital must carry signals in an analog format. After December 12, 2012, operators of hybrid cable systems may avoid such "dual carriage" and instead satisfy the viewability requirements of Section 614(b)(7) ofthe Act by offering digital equipment (e.g. set-top boxes) to analog subscribers "at no cost or at an affordable cost."4 The Commission also expects cable operators to notify affected must carry stations 90 days, and affected cable subscribers 30 days, in advance of suspending analog delivery of a must carry station. 5 Charter has fully complied with these requirements and expectations. Accordingly, Charter respectfully requests the Petition be denied. I. Charter Provided Proper Notice to the Station That It Was Suspending AnalogDelivery of KJLA. The Petition initially contends that Charter failed to provide the Station with notification of the Company's plan to deliver KJLA in digital-only format. In fact, Charter sent a letter dated November 13, 2012, to the Station at the exact address identified on the FCC's website (the "November Notice"). 6 The November Notice clearly advises the Station that "on or after4 See 2012 Viewability Order at~ 11. 5 See id. at ~ 17. 6 See Exhibit 1. The same address appears on KJLA's website. See id.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000022February 12, 2013, Charter will convert the analog presentation of your station's primary broadcast signal into a digital format" on various identified channel lineups. 7 The November Notice further explains that KJLA "will continue to be available to ALL of [Charter's] customers ... in a digital format on the basic tier of service." 8The electronic receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, attached hereto as Exhibit 3, confirms that the November Notice was actually delivered to and received by the Station. Despite the Station's claims to the contrary, Charter did, in fact, provide the Station with proper notice that on or after February 12, 20l3, it would deliver only a digital version ofKJLA's signal on the relevant cable systems. II. Charter Properly Notified Its Subscribers That It Was Suspending Analog DeliveryofKJLA. The Petition criticizes Charter's subscriber notices as "underwhelming," but ultimately concedes that Charter did, in fact, notify subscribers of the proposed channel delivery format change. 9 Indeed, the Petition includes a copy of a Charter customer bill, which includes a message entitled "Important Notice," unambiguously advising subscribers: "Effective on or after February 12, 2013, Charter will offer the following channels [including KJLA] exclusively in a digital format." 10 The bill message is equally clear in explaining that the planned format change "will require digital equipment in order to view these channels on all of your television sets."11 Charter included the digital migration notice in the bills of all of its subscribers in the affected communities issued during the period December 13, 2012 to January 12, 2013. KJLA may not7 A copy of the November Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. 8 !d. (Emphasis in original). 9 Petition at 5. 10 See Petition at 5, and Exhibit A. 11 See id.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000023like Charter's bill message, but it clearly satisfies the notification requirements and expectations set forth in the Commission's Rules and the 2012 Viewability Order, which does not dictate specific notification language or methodologies.The Petition erroneously contends that, beyond the billing inserts (which by themselves clearly provide adequate notification to customers), "Charter has not engaged in any more extensive efforts to educate analog subscribers of the steps that need to be taken to transition to digital service to retain the programming of must-carry stations such as KJLA."12 Again, the Station is wrong. Although not required to do so, Charter sent a separate letter on January I0, 2013, regarding the digital transition to all of its limited basic service tier subscribers, which are the subscribers most likely to be affected by Charter's delivery format change (the "January Subscriber Notice"). 13 As was the case with the bill messages, this stand-alone notification clearly advises subscribers that after February 12, Charter would deliver certain signals, including KJLA, "exclusively in digital format."14 The January Subscriber Notice goes on to explain that the format change will require digital equipment to view the channels at issue and that Charter will provide the necessary equipment at no cost.1512 Petition at 5. While the Petition is quick to criticize Charter's subscriber notification process, it says nothing about KJLA's own viewer outreach efforts. Despite the fact that the Station claims to have become aware of Charter's format change in November 2012, Charter is not aware that KJLA itself notified viewers ofthe change, as expressly contemplated by the Commission in the 2012 Viewability Order. 2012 Viewability Order at ~17 ("Advance notice about planned carriage changes will allow must-carry stations to notify their viewers - through on-air messages, website postings, mailings or other forms of communications of their choosing -about the planned change in carriage, and about the viewers' options to ensure continued access to the station's programming.").13 See Exhibit 4.14 See id.15 !d.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000024In addition to the bill messages and stand-alone subscriber notifications described above, Charter published a "Legal Notice" regarding Charter's proposed transition to digital-only service in each of seven newspapers available to subscribers in the affected communities, including the Big Bear Grizzly (1/16/13), the Burbank Leader (1/12/13), the Glendale News Press (1/12113), the Press Telegram (Long Beach)(l/9/13), the Press Enterprise (Riverside)(1/11/13), the San Gabriel Valley Tribune (1/16/13), and the Daily Press (Victorville)(l/11/13). 16 Thus, despite the Stations claims to the contrary, Charter's digital service transition notice to subscribers was more than adequate. III. Charter is Offering Analog Customers Free Set-Top Boxes to Assist With theTransition to Digital-Only Service. The Station also incorrectly contends that Charter does not offer viable low-cost equipment to allow analog subscribers to access digital-only stations, such as KJLA. 17 As noted above, Charter's subscriber notifications emphasize that such digital equipment is necessary for continued viewing of the subject channels and provide a phone number for subscribers to call to obtain the equipment. Charter's January Subscriber Notice also clearly indicates that Charter will provide the necessary digital equipment for free. 18 In fact, Charter has supplied its subscribers with thousands of free set-top boxes since first notifying them in December 2012 of its plans to deliver multiple channels of programming, including KJLA, in digital format only.16 The language in each newspaper notice is the same as in Charter's bill notifications. A sample "Legal Notice" from the Press Enterprise is attached hereto as Exhibit 5.17 See Petition at 6.18 See Exhibit 4.DWT21458162vl 0108600-0000025The Petition complains bitterly that Charter customer service representatives inform analog subscribers about available digital packages. 19 But, as the Station well knows, there is nothing in the Commission's rules or the 2012 Viewability Order that prohibits such marketing°efforts. 2 Charter concedes that customer service representatives may promote Charter's variousdigital packages, but it vehemently denies that its customer service representatives are instructed to present Charter's various digital packages as the only means by which analog subscribers may view recently migrated stations, as the Station claims. Charter has already distributed large numbers of set-top boxes to analog customers at no cost, and it continues to do so in response to customer calls to Charter representatives in connection with the digital channel migration. The Station's specious claims about Charter's marketing practices are further undermined by the fact that the toll-free number on the January Subscriber Notice,21 permits subscribers to order free set-top boxes without ever speaking with a customer service representative.The Commission has determined "that a range of charges for DTAs and set top boxes i.e., free or a monthly fee of no more than $2- would satisfy the requirement for affordable19 See Petition at 6.20 The Station's criticism of comments made by Charter's CEO, Thomas Rutledge, regarding the Company's plans to go all digital on a nationwide basis is similarly flawed. See Petition at 6-7. Notwithstanding the Station's views, digital transmission is the inevitable successor to analog transmission. Having itself transitioned to digital delivery several years ago, the Station can hardly criticize Charter for embarking down the same path. Indeed, the Commission has long contemplated and encouraged the cable industry's transition to all-digital operations. See 2012 Viewability Order at~ 13 ("We continue to expect most cable operators will eventually transition to all-digital systems.").21 See Exhibit 4.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000026equipment .. .." 22 As noted above, Charter offers to provide set-top boxes to analog customers free of charge. 23 In short, Charter is providing affordable digital equipment that allows customers continued access to channels that are no longer delivered in analog format, in full compliance with the Commission's expectations, as set forth in the 2012 Viewability Order. IV. Charter's Approach to Transitioning Its Systems to All-Digital Is Consistent withthe 2012 Viewability Order. Finally, the Petition makes much of the fact that Charter's February 12, 2013 digital channel migration included some, but not all, of the broadcast stations carried on Charter's cable systems. The Commission, however, has already considered and rejected this objection. There is no requirement under 2012 Viewability Order that a cable operator must treat all local broadcast signals consistently with regard to analog carriage. To the contrary, the 2012 Viewability Order is premised on the fundamental notion that the operator of a hybrid analog/digital cable system shall have sole discretion to determine whether it carries a particular must carry signal in analog or digital format, provided that the operator complies with the specific conditions set forth in that Order. In the end, it is clear that KJLA disagrees with the Commission's conclusion that a must carry station is no longer entitled to analog carriage simply because other programming services are delivered in analog. But the Station's disagreement with Commission rules and policy does not justify requiring Charter to resume analog carriage of KJLA.22 2012 Viewability Order at~ 14. (The Commission referenced several specific examples of compliant equipment offers, including Comcast's offering of two or three free DTAs, Time Warner's provision of "one or more" free DTAs for two years, and Bright House's offer to provide set-top boxes to basic service tier customers for $1 a month.).23 Charter is prepared to extend a free or low-cost set-top box offer if its transition to all-digital operations on any of the systems at issue extends beyond its current equipment offer period.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000027CONCLUSION Charter timely informed the Station and its own subscribers that it was suspending analogdelivery ofKJLA, it advised subscribers that this change would require digital equipment, and itnas provided such equipment to thousands of subscribers free of charge -- all in full compliance with the Commission's rules and stated expectations. For the foregoing reasons, Charter respectfully request that the Commission deny the Petition.April 8 2013Respectfully submitted,CCO SoCal I, LLC'By: S ven J. Horvitz rederick W.
