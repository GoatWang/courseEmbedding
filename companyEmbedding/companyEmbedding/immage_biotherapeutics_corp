Learn more about MAGE-A: The MAGE-A: antigen is a cancer testis antigen that is expressed within the human testes.  It is highly immunogenic and has been considered as a viable target for the development of immunotherapies of tumors overexpressing the MAGE-A family of antigens.  The MAGE-A sub-family of cancer testis antigen are expressed in germ cells, though not exclusively. They may drive malignancy and since those antigens are highly immunogenic they lend themselves to possibly becoming potential effective target for immunotherapies.  Antigens particular to each MAGE-A family, has a unique expression pattern and related tissue target, which defines its differential use as immunotherapy regiments.
