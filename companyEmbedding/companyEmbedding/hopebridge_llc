Their BCBA's have no clue what they're doing. They have turned away children for being too aggressive instead of helping them overcome behaviors. They expect therapists to design the children's programs, when they don't have the background, support, or training to do so. The children do not progress and their goals merely confuse them because they make no sense. Ex. A child has no attending skills, and can't attend to their own name, but yet they have a goal to receptively ID a picture on a table of a random item like a car. It doesn't make sense. The BCBA's reinforce bad behaviors. You don't get breaks to eat, and the company only gives a few cent "raises" Every year. The new people coming in are at a much lower rate of pay than older employees because they choose quantity over quality in their employees since I've left. They're firing all the old employees, and seems like it's because they are tired of paying them a higher pay rate. They try to come after people after they leave for the non-compete clause which is void because they didn't sign it in the first place.Advice to ManagementQuit ruining the lives of children and giving false hope to parents.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-07-11 09:45 PDT May 18, 2017 Helpful (3)"The Hopebridge Experience"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - ABA Therapist in Jeffersonville, INCurrent Employee - ABA Therapist in Jeffersonville, INRecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Hopebridge full-time (Less than a year)ProsSome of the pros of working at Hopebridge include getting to work with a supportive team of BCBAs and coworkers, the rewarding experience in helping a child grow to their full potential, and experiencing something different every single day. The job of working with kiddos makes everyday exciting and new.ConsOne con of working at Hopebridge is that breaks can be hard to come by. Depending on what kind of day your kiddo is having, you may or may not get a chance to take a break. For example, if you are working with a kiddo displaying a high frequency of problem behaviors, you may not get a chance to eat some lunch if you are busy managing behaviors and working a de escalation tactic.Advice to ManagementMy advice to ANY management team is to never forget that your employees need reinforcement, just like our kiddos do! A little pat on the back goes a long way.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-05-18 11:24 PDT May 16, 2017 Helpful (3)"From the Corporate Office"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Corporate Staff Member in Indianapolis, INCurrent Employee - Corporate Staff Member in Indianapolis, INRecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Hopebridge full-time (Less than a year)ProsGood environment; nice people. Bosses are not overly demanding and make sure that (at least in my case, and the cases I've watched) employees have all the resources needed to do a good job. There is also room to "shine"; since last year when I joined, those who do a good job appear to be awarded with more responsibility.ConsThe business is growing fast, which causes stress. Juggling dozens of tasks sometimes causes the "right hand" to not know for a day or two what the "left hand" is trying to accomplish. Miscommunication. Not awful, though. Management tends to be pretty good about doing periodic updates or reevaluations to keep everything in focus. And they don't shift blame on occasional lapses.Advice to ManagementNone at the moment. Management works hard and pays attention. Most inconveniences that have occurred seem linked to unusually high levels of activity/workload and the miscommunications that stem from having so many distractions.Quick Note: My "No Opinion" rating for the CEO is not based on anything negative -- merely that my sphere of influence is too far removed from him to give a good estimation. But he seems to be very competent and the business seems to be doing well.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-05-16 11:49 PDT May 18, 2017 Helpful (2)"Amazing place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - RBT/ABA Therapist in Marion, INCurrent Employee - RBT/ABA Therapist in Marion, INRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Hopebridge full-time (Less than a year)ProsHopebridge is an amazing place to work. The company focuses on helping you to be the best employee you can be through many training interventions and provides a multitude of resources to help you assist your client to grow and develop into the best individual they can be.The employees all have a team work mindset. We are not in it for ourselves, we are here for the clients and to provide support for each other. The company provides a fun and inviting atmosphere and every day you go home feeling as you have made a positive difference in the life of a child. Teaching in a Special Education classroom I struggled with being able to advocate for and meet the needs of each child I worked with. Here at Hopebridge I feel that I am able to truly help my client to the best of my abilities. With the assistance and guidance of BCBA's and an amazing team of RBT therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, and Speech and Feeding Therapists I feel that we at Hopebridge really do strive to create the best life possible for our clients.ConsWe use PTO as sick days.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-05-18 14:15 PDT May 16, 2017 Helpful (2)"BCBA"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - BCBACurrent Employee - BCBARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Hopebridge full-time (Less than a year)Pros-Management is receptive to feedback and communicates clearly and timely.-Salary and Bonus Package-Culture of the company (collaborative, team work, innovative)-Progressive-Lots of opportunity for advancement-Patient care is excellentCons-Some systems are still being streamlined and developed.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-05-16 06:31 PDT Jun 27, 2017"ABA Therapist"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOProsIt was great having the opportunity to work with childrenConsSeveral false promises from management team and recruitment.

Accessibility to executive management has been incredibly beneficial; both as a therapist during Meet and Eat meetings and as a manager within the clinic; I've witnessed changes occur in response to specific feedback from current employees.2. The company offers a very competitive wage; with opportunities for multiple bonuses and full benefits. Paid Time Off is also available upon start without having to "earn" your time off.3. The company has a solid business model led by individuals with a background in building successful businesses. In order to provide effective therapy and continue to treat patients, the doors have to stay open, and I never worry about that within this company.4. Access to experts in the field helps assure effective treatment and problem solve when a patient does not exhibit the desired trajectory. The consulting BCBA-D on staff is incredibly helpful, accessible, knowledgeable, and encouraging. Offering education to the staff as a means of finding a solution to creating more effective treatment protocols. He pushes the clinicians to grow their knowledge without leading them directly to the answer.ConsThe company is experiencing astounding growth and with growth often comes growing pains. My only cons to date would be some discrepancies within the recruiting department, and sometimes needing quicker access to necessary resources with rapid growth; both materials/supplies, and curriculum/programming resources.Advice to ManagementI would love to have the opportunity in the future for a matching 401K as I look forward to retirement planning.I hope that as growth continues, access to EM doesn't diminish; it really is a cornerstone of the feeling of success and importance within the company.The culture and values of the company are what brought me to this company and sometimes I feel like they need to be enforced as a priority for all staff.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Hopebridge Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hopebridge 2017-05-16 09:13 PDT Showing 24 of 25 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Hopebridge RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleRBT (3) BCBA (2) CloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreHopebridge PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsHealth InsuranceVacation & Paid Time OffSick DaysDental InsuranceAdd BenefitsSee AllSee All Job Seekers Also ViewedCornerstone Autism Center ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 15 ReviewsCumberland Therapy Services ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 14 ReviewsAngie's List ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 486 ReviewsKaiser Permanente ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 4,720 ReviewsGenesis HealthCare ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,157 ReviewsHospital Corporation of America ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,196 ReviewsBrookdale Senior Living ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,995 ReviewsinVentiv Health ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 648 ReviewsExpress Scripts ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 2,207 ReviewsKindred Healthcare ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,209 ReviewsQuest Diagnostics ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,544 Reviews Related Job SearchRegistered Nurse jobsRegistered Nurse salaries ($59k)Pharmacy Technician jobsPharmacy Technician salaries ($23k)Medical Assistant jobsMedical Assistant salaries ($29k)Pharmacist jobsPharmacist salaries ($120k)Administrative Assistant jobsAdministrative Assistant salaries ($36k)Nurse Practitioner jobsNurse Practitioner salaries ($98k)Director jobsDirector salaries ($137k)Patient Care Technician jobsPatient Care Technician salaries ($25k)Project Manager jobsProject Manager salaries ($90k)Pharmacy Technician Trainee jobsPharmacy Technician Trainee salaries ($20k)Physician jobsPhysician salaries ($176k)Customer Service Representative jobsCustomer Service Representative salaries ($25k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
