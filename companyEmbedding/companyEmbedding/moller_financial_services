Jack Moller, CFP® 




 





                    Jack Moller, CFP®        





                    Founder, President, and CEO        


In 1991, Jack Moller and his father Bill established Moller Financial Services, a financial planning and investment management firm. Jack has served as president since inception. He formulates the investment and financial planning philosophy and remains personally involved in ensuring that the firm's clients remain on track to achieve their financial goals.
Markets have been in Jack’s blood as far back as he can remember. Growing up the son of a grain trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, Jack has had a fascination with and been involved in markets for most of his life. His experience is varied with stints trading stocks on the computer, bond options in the “pit”, and bond arbitrage as part of a trading team before founding Moller Financial 25 years ago. These decades of experience in financial markets have included epic bull markets periodically interrupted by such things as the worst one-day stock market crash in history not to mention the worst financial crisis since the Depression. The ups and downs have helped form Jack’s belief in the importance of implementing systematic strategies that keep the emotions out of investing. Jack continues his love affair with markets as an avid reader and occasional writer on all things related to markets and economics.
Jack earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University before going on to attain a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He earned his Certified Financial Planner® designation in 1994. Jack enjoys living in Glencoe following Chicago sports teams, occasionally playing golf and traveling. He has three adult children: Megan, Jake and Luke.

You are hereHomeAbout UsOur Principles 


Our Principles 

Investing decisions must be made in the context of a comprehensive, personalized plan geared to meet specific, quantifiable objectives. In serving your financial needs, we adhere to five core principles:

Written Plan. Financial and investment plans need to be in writing so that the document becomes the primary instrument guiding all decisions.
Long-Term Focus. Short-term market and economic moves are unknowable, while long-term market appreciation is inevitable. Successful investors take advantage of this long-term trend to achieve their goals.
Emotional Discipline. The key risk most investors face is that they might succumb to their emotions, selling in a panic or buying in euphoria. Maintaining a disciplined approach protects you from making decisions based on emotions.
Low Costs. The goal is for you, not the investment company, to capture the investment returns.
In Your Best Interest. Your financial advisor's incentives must work in alignment with your own objectives, and our asset-based fees avoid potential conflicts.

Our Story 

Moller Financial Services began in 1991 when Jack Moller and his father, Bill, perceived a great need for personalized financial advice. At the time, the predominant advisor relationship was based on products, transactions, and sales commissions. Jack and Bill decided to offer a unique advisory model that was instead based on independent advice, transparent cost (“fee-only”), and a fiduciary standard of care. Moller Financial was an industry leader by providing plan-focused and client-centered relationships for managing wealth.
We are thankful for the opportunity to have built relationships, developed financial plans, and managed wealth for hundreds of clients over the last 25 years. Moller Financial has had an advisory relationship with some clients for over 20 years! Over this time, we have helped clients pay for their children’s college education, comfortably retire, donate to charity, and transfer wealth to future generations. We have also been through the tough times with clients such as market turmoil, family illness, divorce, death of a loved one. Each relationship and plan is unique and important to us.
Moller Financial continues to provide financial leadership, guidance, and management according to each person's situation and commitments. We have found that as careers and families grow, so does the complexity and responsibility of making good financial decisions. Our team's expertise and personalized wealth management process allows you to enjoy your own pursuits and interests while we care for your long-term success.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises

1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
