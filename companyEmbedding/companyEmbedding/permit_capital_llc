Investment Philosophy
Investment Process

We work closely with clients to understand their goals and to build a comprehensive, diversified investment program that is designed for  their unique needs.  We begin with a strategic asset allocation plan, and we create customized blended benchmarks that provide a frame of reference for performance. All of this is memorialized in a robust Investment Policy Statement that is created for each client and serves as a guidepost for future decisions.  We spend a great deal of time ensuring that clients are comfortable with our recommendations, and we provide regular commentary to help them navigate the changes in the markets. We strive to have interactive, collaborative and long-term relationships with our clients. 
We utilize external investment managers who have proven, long-term track records of success. We have been with many of these managers through various market cycles. We manage costs by scaling our relationships with these managers and by employing commingled funds where appropriate.

Permit Capital Advisors, LLC - Investment Process






































 


 
Investment Process


Investment Approach

Investment Services
Investment Philosophy
Investment Process

Taking the strategic asset allocation plan that is developed for each client, the next step involves the construction of an appropriate portfolio.  The strategic plan will form the underpinnings of the portfolio; however if the risk-return profile can be improved upon in a particular market environment by deviating slightly from the plan we will do so.  For example, while the structural exposure to equities and fixed income are important to maintain, there will be scenarios in which an investor can move up or down the capital structure of a company and pick up incremental return or reduce incremental risk without a significant trade-off.  This has been a source of historical value that our clients have enjoyed. 
The due diligence process that governs the decision regarding which investments to allocate to within predetermined asset classes is another important part of our process.  If a passive approach is the most efficient exposure to take within an asset class, we will evaluate a range of options that covers traditional market benchmarks as well as those based upon fundamental determinants rather than a pure capitalization-weighted approach.  While we don't avoid traditional investment options, we don't solely rely upon them.
Evaluating active managers is a process that we have refined over many years. The managers we work with have attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns relative to peers and benchmarks, but their historical results must be accompanied by a proven adherence to a specific investment philosophy.  We evaluate a range of quantitative and qualitative metrics, as we recognize that satisfactory results over time can only be delivered by a quality organization.  By maintaining regular contact with our managers, and understanding and explaining to our clients what has driven performance historically, we are confident that we can be proactive rather than reactive in making decisions about the ongoing appropriateness of an investment with a manager.  This holds true across both traditional and alternative asset classes.

Permit Capital Advisors, LLC - Investment Philosophy






































 


 
Investment Philosophy


Investment Approach

Investment Services
Investment Philosophy
Investment Process

We believe that clients' investment needs are best served using a holistic, customized approach that utilizes an open architecture and is free of conflicts of interest. In our view, the best results are driven by the needs of the client rather than the products offered by a firm. We appreciate that our clients  possess varied goals for their investments, and we strive to build investment programs that meet those goals while understanding, managing and communicating the associated risks. 
By effectively evaluating opportunities across various asset classes, vehicles and providers, we are confident that we can craft the best investment solutions.  We have relationships with many firms in our industry, including those that are more boutique-like in nature as well as those that add value by virtue of scope and scale.  We feel an approach that is driven solely by a fiduciary-like decision process, which puts the needs of the clients above all else, leads to the most beneficial allocations across the investment spectrum.  Utilizing a combination of active and passive approaches where appropriate, we believe that the portfolios that we construct are designed to meet client objectives over time in even the most volatile of market landscapes.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .
