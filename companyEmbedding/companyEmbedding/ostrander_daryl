Daryl Ostrander
 Daryl Ostrander
 Senior Vice President, Manufacturing and Technology, Microprocessor Solutions Sector (MSS)
In Oct 2002, Daryl assumed his current role as Senior Vice President, Manufacturing and Technology, Microprocessor Solutions Sector (MSS). In this role, Daryl has responsibility for AMD worldwide fab operations in Dresden (Fabs 30 and 36) and Singapore (Chartered), assembly/test operations in Penang, Singapore and Suzhou China, and technology development operations at IBM in East Fishkill, NY. These responsibilities include overseeing a work force in excess of 5000 people and an expense budget in excess of $1B.
In January 1998 Daryl was promoted to Group Vice President of Wafer Fab Technology Implementation. His primary responsibility was to assure rapid transfer and implementation of new technology into volume manufacturing in AMD’s wafer fabs. Today’s methodologies of continuously increasing transistor performance and the use of APM to enable control capabilities required of these methodologies originated from this role.
Daryl was named to the position of Vice President, Austin Wafer Fabrication, in 1993, with responsibility for Fabs 10, 14, and 15 in Austin and subsequently took the helm of Fab 25 in 1996. This responsibility included all wafer manufacturing and support operations in Austin, which involved overseeing a work force of 1,500 and a $200 million expense budget. The process/product mix included submicron logic, programmable logic devices and flash memories.
Daryl joined AMD in 1981 as Director of Fab 10, where he was responsible for the startup and ramp-to-volume of 125mm logic, SRAM, DRAM, and NMOS wafer fabrication operations. In 1985, he became Director of Fab 15 and was responsible for startup and ramp-to-volume of 150mm logic CMOS wafer fabrication operations. In 1990, Daryl assumed responsibility for both wafer manufacturing facilities and related support functions.
Before coming to AMD, Daryl spent seven years with Texas Instruments in Houston, Texas.
Daryl received a bachelor’s degree in physics from Rice University and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Houston. He is a member of the National Physics Honor Society.
