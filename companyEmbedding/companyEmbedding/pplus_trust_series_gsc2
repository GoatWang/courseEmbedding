     For
information with respect to the underlying securities held by PPLUS
Trust Series GSC-2, please refer to The Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc.’s (Commission file number 001-14965) periodic reports,
including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and other information on file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”). You can read and copy these reports and other
information at the public reference facilities maintained by the
SEC at Room 1580, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may
obtain copies of this material for a fee by writing to the
SEC’s Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information about the
operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330. You can also access some of this information
electronically by means of the SEC’s website on the Internet
at http://www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and
information statements and other information that the underlying
securities guarantor and the underlying securities issuer has filed
electronically with the SEC.

     Although
we have no reason to believe the information concerning the
underlying securities and the junior subordinated debentures or the
underlying securities issuer and the underlying securities
guarantor contained in the underlying securities guarantor’s
Exchange Act reports is not reliable, neither the depositor nor the
trustee participated in the preparation of such documents or made
any due

inquiry with respect to the information provided therein. No
investigation with respect to the underlying securities issuer and
the underlying securities guarantor (including, without limitation,
no investigation as to their financial condition or
creditworthiness) or of the underlying securities and the junior
subordinated debentures has been made. You should obtain and
evaluate the same information concerning the underlying securities
issuer and the underlying securities guarantor as you would obtain
and evaluate if your investment were directly in the underlying
securities or in other securities

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
