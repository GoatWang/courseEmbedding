Job Details
               It is Sangui BioTech's mission to develop innovative pharmaceuticals and medical products serving the biological regeneration of cells through compensatory supply of oxygen as a vital substrate to the human body. In pursuit of these goals, Professor Wolfgang K. Barnikol established the first Sangui Company in Mainz, Germany, in 1995. At that time, two main projects had evolved from his earlier university and publicly funded studies:the development of a haemoglobin based artificial oxygen carrier to be used as a life-saving blood additive in all cases of severe deficiencies of oxygen supply (e.g. as aligned with stroke, heart attack, lung shock etc.),the development of an implantable glucose sensor based on photometric measurement helping diabetes patients to easily and continuously monitor their glucose level, hence improving their insulin and creating a better quality of life. This project was discontinued in the meantime. In order to obtain additional funding, in 1997 the company underwent a restructuring in the event of which Sangui BioTech International, Inc., a Colorado company, emerged (Certificate of Good Standing). As the parent company of the operating SanguiBioTech GmbH of Witten, Germany, it is traded on the electronic securities trading platform www.otcmarkets.com (symbol: SGBI), as well as on the OTC market in Hamburg (WKN: 906757). Like most biotech companies, Sangui BioTech International met increasing difficulties to address the capital market for additional funding after the decline of the markets since 2001. Unlike some biotech companies Sangui has been able to refocus its activities on products which promised to be marketable in the short term. Of paramount importance is the unique:

Specialties of Striepe, Thomas J. Attorney:

Attorneys













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.
