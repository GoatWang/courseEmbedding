Net Remaining Proceeds               $-             $-             $-             $-

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $.75. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale
by the Company. There is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the
offering.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from operations. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from 
this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the 
application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that
we will need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business 
plan.

In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would
utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:

. for general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees 
  and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting
  obligations with the SEC                                 

. for sales and marketing; and

. for development of new projects.

Our current mailing address is located at 338 South Sharon Amity Rd. Charlotte,
NC 28211. Our telephone number is 1(888) 318-5124.


Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented, subject to rapid change and
has low barriers to entry. We may in the future compete for potential customers
with solar and HVAC systems installers and servicers, electricians, utilities
and other providers of solar power equipment or electric power. Some of these
competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources and greater name recognition than we have.

We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors
outside of our control, including:

• the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate qualified 
  personnel;                                                                  
                                                                                   
• the ownership by competitors of proprietary tools to customize systems to the
  needs of a particular customer;                                         
                                                                                   
• the price at which others offer comparable services and equipment;          
                                                                                   
• the extent of our competitors’ responsiveness to customer needs; and        
                                                                                   
• installation technology.                                                    

Competition in the solar power services industry may increase in the future,
partly due to low barriers to entry, as well as from other alternative energy
resources now in existence or developed in the future. Increased competition
could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share and
greater competition for qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If
we are unable to compete effectively, or if competition results in a
deterioration of market conditions, our business and results of operations would
be adversely affected.


Company Description
In 2012, the Board of Directors of Norcor decided to transition the Company into
developing Solar Energy as the future for the Company. Norcor will be
concentrating on developing Solar Farms in Jamaica, the Caribbean, Africa and
the United States. Based on this decision the company is undertaking


 this public
offering to raise funds for the future development of the company.

Solar Farm Projects:

The Solar projects include the construction of several Solar Farms in the United
States and the Caribbean and a ten Mega Watts Geothermal Plant in Kenya, Africa.
These projects will feed into the grid of the existing Utility Companies. In
some cases we will go directly to homes especially in rural and remote areas
where there are no electricity.

Norcor plans to enter into a joint venture with 510 Nano, a North Carolina based
developer of renewable energy projects and technologies, with the purpose of
developing several solar farms in North Carolina. The farms that will be
developed through this joint venture will be in the 1.5 Megawatt to 2.5 Megawatt
range.

The Company has already secured locations for these farms, with land parcels
totaling 32 acres. The parcels will be leased for 25 years with five-year
extensions upon mutual agreement. The Company has contracted with Duke Energy to
deliver energy to its service territories, with the parties having already
entered into 15 year purchased power agreements. The farms built in North
Carolina will produce $720,000 to $1,080,000 of income per year.

The Company also plans to construct solar farms in Jamaica. The first solar farm
constructed will be 10 to 15 Megawatts, and may be built in conjunction with
Windstream Technologies, a designer of affordable and renewable energy
technologies based in the U.S. and South Asia. The farm will be located in the
parish of Trelawny, Jamaica, with a small parcel of land already leased and an
option to lease an additional 20 acres if needed. The Company plans to secure a
20 year power purchase agreement with the Jamaican power company “JPS”.

Norcor is also considering several mergers with companies in the solar business
and other complementary technologies.
