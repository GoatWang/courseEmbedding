Tips for Increasing Profits Through Tenant Satisfaction

If you're leasing corporate office space, you already know how damaging it is when you have a high rate of turnover. The hit on profits goes beyond lost revenue. You'll also incur losses due to leasing commissions, making improvements for new tenants in areas like office design and promotional offers to attract new tenants.

Workplace design can have a profound effect on employee productivity. Think of your office the same way you think of your home — a cluttered mess can invite stress, worry and apathy. Those three traits can be productivity killers.

The Best Time to Look for Office Space






Tweet






















The best time to look for new office space depends on your company’s size, needs and location. There is no one-size-fits-all formula for determining when the search for office space should begin, but it is critical not to wait until the last minute. Commercial real estate becomes available at all different times during the year, so you don't have to be concerned with meeting any seasonal deadlines. Selecting office space for your upcoming relocation can be a very complex and unfamiliar endeavor, one that may take months or even years.
For most businesses, the stakes for choosing an optimal location are high. Settling on an office space in the wrong location could be costly to a business, while not accurately planning for growth could mean moving again in a few years, which strains both budget and productivity. The moving process itself can be expensive and time consuming, which is why it’s important to begin the search early. Office space costs are generally the second biggest cost to a company (preceded by employee costs), so it's important to spend enough time evaluating your needs and options.

Tips to Keep in Mind the Next Time You Negotiate Your Lease






Tweet






















Leases can be subject to change from year to year based on your contract terms. As your business approaches its lease renewal, entering into negotiations can be beneficial for both your business and your landlord. The topics of negotiation will vary widely, depending on your business’s needs, your lease terms and the fluctuating real estate market, but one of the best ways to successfully negotiate a lease renewal is to be well researched and prepared. Gaining insight into your business needs and the needs and position of your landlord will make lease negotiations proceed with more ease and clarity. As your business moves forward into the negotiating phase, consider the following five tips:

5 Things to Consider when Deciding to Buy vs. Lease






Tweet






















For most businesses, office space is a necessity. When faced with the possibility of leasing or buying, how should your business decide which is better? Making this decision can be a daunting task, as many factors, both in and out of the business itself, must be carefully weighed and analyzed before a final decision is made. Before making a move, consider the following five questions:
1. What are the chances of relocating, expanding, or downsizing in the foreseeable future?

How to Choose an Office Space Design for Your Type of Business






Tweet






















Increasingly, more companies are looking for efficient and creative ways to use their office space. Smart office space design can mean leaner energy use and more efficient workflow. Alternative workspace arrangements involve moving beyond the standard square foot per associate calculation, integrating spatial, behavioral and technical factors in workspace design and space allocation. The trend has emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication in the workplace. Just how to achieve that harmonious balance varies according to the business and its specific work methods. Offices have transformed from simply a place-to-work to a place-to-innovate, fostering idea sharing and (hopefully) happier employees. The concept of a one size fits all office space is obsolete and inefficient, which is why businesses are taking more interest in office design strategies and the benefits they can bring to a company.

High Tech Companies Responsible for 20% of US Office Leasing Activities in 2014






Tweet






















The thriving technology sector is playing an important role in the recovery of the U.S. office market, as recent rental activity indicates. According to CBRE Group, Inc.'s August 2014 research report, U.S. Tech-Twenty: Measuring Office Market Impact, the high tech sector has created one fourth of all office-using jobs created between 2009 and May 2014. The booming job growth in the tech sector is directly reflected in national office leasing activity. In 2014, the high tech sector accounted for 20% of all U.S. office leasing activity, making it the top office leasing industry in the U.S., and there is little reason to expect that percentage to drop anytime soon.
Office leasing activity rose 14% from 2013 to 2014, and the 2015 outlook is strong. Tech firms in both the private and public sector are indicating growth in the upcoming years, meaning office expansions are on the horizon, and with the high tech industry far outpacing its peers in growth, the leasing trend is expected to remain strong. What exactly does this growth mean for high tech companies in search of office space? The importance of finding the right office space for current and future needs is becoming increasingly imperative.

Office Move – What Does This Mean to My IT Department?






Tweet






















Planning for the IT logistics portion of your office move begins the moment you sign the lease.  While the technology portion is often the most complex part of the relocation to new space, you can minimize risk and maximize success with thoughtful, upfront planning.

1)  Plan, Plan, and Plan Some More 
Technology and office furniture will likely be the two items with the longest lead times for your new space.  They also have significant dependencies on each other, especially as it relates to cabling requirements for furniture.  Make sure that you include team leaders from the technology and office management organizations on your move project team.

What are analysts saying about Corporate Office Properties Trust stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Corporate Office Properties Trust stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Corporate Office Properties Trust is a fully-integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust that focuses principally on the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition and development of suburban office buildings located in select submarkets in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.  Corporate Office Properties operates three real estate service companies:  Corporate Development Services, Corporate Office Services and Corporate Management Services.   " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "OFC has been one of the top Trump trades among REITs given the company's focus on the defense industry. That said, with the stock having run 28% since the election, and now trading at an FFO multiple that is 25% above its 5- year average, we believe the potential for fundamental improvement is already priced in. At these levels, we prefer to wait on the sidelines until Congress approves a budget and we have a better sense of the upside." (2/21/2017)
3. Mizuho analysts commented, "OFC reported solid 4Q16 results with same store NOI growth of 4.2% possibly restoring any lost confidence from investors after the 1% growth during 3Q16 -- although both were in line with prevailing expectations. Management reiterated 2017 guidance that was set on January 17, 2017.  We are actually raising our 2017 estimates slightly today (by $0.02) given what we feel like is more visible stability/growth that lies ahead. In particular, OFC sits at a rare intersection of political agreement, with US defense spending increases being in general agreement from both sides of the aisle." (2/13/2017)

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
