FIRST NATIONAL
CORPORATION REPORTS IMPROVEMENT IN CORE OPERATING
RESULTS

 

Strasburg,
Virginia (October 22,
2010) --- First National Corporation (OTCBB: FXNC) reported net
income of $694 thousand and net income available to common
shareholders of $473 thousand, or $0.16 per basic and diluted
share, for the third quarter of 2010, compared to net income of
$818 thousand and net income available to common shareholders of
$598 thousand, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the same
quarter of 2009.

 

Core operating
results increased 30% to $2.3 million for the third quarter of
2010, up from $1.7 million for the third quarter of
2009.  “We are pleased to report solid earnings for
the quarter,” said Harry Smith, President and Chief Executive
Officer of First National Corporation.  “The net
interest margin and expense control efforts contributed to improved
core operating results for the quarter.  The Company is
continuing to focus on improving profitability and asset
quality.”  

 

Core operating
results are measured by net income before taxes, less non-recurring
items, provision for loan losses and provision for other real
estate owned.

 

Quarterly
Performance

 

Third quarter
2010 net income was $124 thousand lower than the same quarter of
2009 :

 




§  



Provision for
loan losses was $806 thousand higher





§  



Net
interest income was $402 thousand higher





§  



Noninterest
income was $161 thousand higher





§  



Noninterest
expense was $56 thousand lower




 

The decrease
in third quarter 2010 earnings compared to third quarter 2009 was
the result of higher provision for loan losses offset by an 8%
increase in net interest income and a 12% increase in noninterest
income.  Noninterest expense decreased slightly when
comparing the two periods.  Return on assets and return
on equity were 0.51% and 4.92%, respectively, for the third quarter
of 2010, compared to 0.59% and 6.11% for the same quarter in
2009.

 

Net interest
income increased 8% to $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2010
compared to $4.8 million for the same quarter of
2009.  The net interest margin was 37 basis points higher
and average interest-earning assets were $7.9 million lower when
comparing the two periods.  The margin was 4.10% for the
quarter ended September 30, 2010 compared to 3.73% for the same
period of 2009.  The margin improvement was primarily the
result of a decline in the cost of funding earning
assets.

 

Noninterest
income totaled $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2010, an
increase of 12%, compared to $1.4 million for the same quarter of
2009.  The increase in noninterest income resulted
primarily from higher trust and investment advisory fees and ATM
and check card fees. Noninterest expense decreased 1% to $4.5
million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $4.6 million for
the same period in 2009.

 

Net
charge-offs were $240 thousand for both the third quarter of 2010
and for the third quarter of 2009.  Nonperforming assets
totaled $15.5 million compared to $16.3 million one year
ago.  The allowance for loan losses totaled $8.6 million
or 1.96% of total loans at September 30, 2010, compared to $7.2
million or 1.60% of total loans at September 30,
2009.  The loan loss provision totaled $1.2 million for
the third quarter of 2010 compared to $394 thousand for the same
period in 2009.  The higher provision for loan losses was
primarily attributable to allocating specific reserves on impaired
loans during the quarter.  The Company has focused on
aggressively identifying and reserving for troubled
loans.
