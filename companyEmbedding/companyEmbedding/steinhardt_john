StartEd and NYU Steinhardt Launch NY Edtech Accelerator and Incubator




Jul 5, 2016
Jul 5, 2016


Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development




							StartEd Companies and NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development today announced a new collaboration to create an EdTech Accelerator and Incubator on NYU's Washington Square campus.
						














StartEd Companies, Inc., a public-benefit corporation, today announced a collaboration with the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University to galvanize the education innovation ecosystem and provide programming in the fields of education entrepreneurship and education technologies. The centerpiece of this collaboration will be an EdTech Accelerator and Incubator on NYU's Washington Square campus.
NYU Steinhardt - StartEd Incubator
The collaboration will include an Incubator for Edtech companies housed in a historic NYU Steinhardt building near Washington Square Park in the heart of Greenwich Village.  Edtech companies can join the NYU Steinhardt community and work in an open-creative environment together with NYU faculty and students.
NYU Steinhardt Edtech Accelerator powered by StartEd
The NYU Steinhardt Edtech Accelerator powered by StartEd is now accepting applications for the October 2016 class from innovative startups focused on technology solutions to improve education and learning -- across all stages from birth through lifelong learning. Each of the 10 companies selected for the program will receive up to $170,000 in funding. Applications are available at https://www.f6s.com/nyuedtechacceleratorbystarted2016. Rolling admissions begin immediately with final selections concluding in early September.
The intensive three-month mentor-led Accelerator program, dedicated to education entrepreneurship, will run from October 2 to December 21, 2016. It provides mentorship, coaching, legal services, development expertise, sales consulting, and business development, among other resources. It is designed to help Edtech entrepreneurs accelerate their companies, culminating in a Demo Day where companies will present in front of an unparalleled network of angel and venture capital education investors.
“As the nation’s first ever School of Pedagogy, NYU Steinhardt has actively participated in 125 years of innovation in education, particularly here in New York City.  We see the EdTech Incubator and Accelerator as a natural extension of that ongoing commitment,” said Dominic J. Brewer, Gale and Ira Drukier Dean of NYU Steinhardt.  “This collaboration with StartEd enables our faculty and students to interact with exciting, emerging companies from all around the world, and some of the country’s most successful Edtech entrepreneurs. Our hope is that this combination of world-class scholars and tech-savvy innovators will create a fertile breeding ground for the next generation of pathbreaking educational solutions.”
