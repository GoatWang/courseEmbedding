The DifferenceBuilding NewCustomer ReferralsAn Award-Winning BuilderYour Dream HomeStanding Behind Our Homes



                The Difference
                

The Taylor Morrison Difference
It's pretty simple when you think about it. We're here to build a home that your family will love to call home and that you'll be proud to own for years to come. If it doesn't meet those standards, we haven't done our job.
We start with a simple question: What makes a great home? Home buyers like you have told us what they value and expect from a home builder. From that feedback, we've created these objectives that we live by every day:

Homes that use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
People who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Financing programs that are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Warranty programs that fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.

These things may seem like simple ideas but they're important. We want you to love the home we build for you. Trust us to build it for you.



                Building New
                
Build New
We've been building homes for more than a century. When you've been doing something that long you learn a few things. You learn the right way to build. You learn that people matter. And you learn that the real staying power is in giving people a home that they want and one you know is built to last. That last one's pretty important, don't you think?
What this means for you is our homes are built to exacting standards and are built by quality people who understand that your home is the most important home they can build. And they're built to give you the lifestyle you want, no matter what life stage you and your family currently occupy.



                Customer Referrals
                
Customer Referrals
We take things like quality construction, superior design and customer service very seriously. It's your home. You've trusted us to build it for you. That means something.
That's why it matters to us what you think of the Taylor Morrison home that you buy. Reviews matter. What you think of our homes matters.
We want to hear from you. We want to know what you think. Only then can we create the best home possible for you and your family.



                An Award-Winning Builder
                
An Award-Winning Builder
Here's the plain truth: Your new home is as important to us as it is to you and your family. There, we said it. We work hard to deliver well-built homes and we stand behind what we build. Our commitment to quality gets right to the point:

Our homes use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
Our craftsmanship doesn't cut corners and pays attention to even the smallest detail.
Our people are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Our communities are built in locations close to excellent schools, shopping and services
Our neighborhoods have plenty of high-quality amenities and public areas
Our financing programs are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Our warranty programs fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.




                Your Dream Home
                
Your Dream Home
At Taylor Morrison, "inspired by you" is more than just a catchphrase…it's our passion. And it's that passion that we call on to deliver your dream home. We want you and your family to love the home you own. We want you to be happy in a Taylor Morrison home.
We think experience matters. More than 100 years of building experience is built into every Taylor Morrison home. Perhaps that's why we are one of the top home builders in the United States.
Today, Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes communities are currently under construction in the Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, drawing accolades from home buyers and industry experts alike. 



                Standing Behind Our Homes
                
Standing Behind Our Homes
Every home we build is backed by one of the best limited warranties in the business. Your new home is covered for any repairs outside of normal maintenance as well as for any major structural defects. How can we do this? Simple. We can offer these assurances because we select quality materials, employ select trade partners and insist on construction techniques proven over time.
Our confidence in our warranty is a reflection of the confidence we have in the homes that we build. But you know what's even better? When you feel just as confident. That's what matters.

The DifferenceBuilding NewCustomer ReferralsAn Award-Winning BuilderYour Dream HomeStanding Behind Our Homes



                The Difference
                

The Taylor Morrison Difference
It's pretty simple when you think about it. We're here to build a home that your family will love to call home and that you'll be proud to own for years to come. If it doesn't meet those standards, we haven't done our job.
We start with a simple question: What makes a great home? Home buyers like you have told us what they value and expect from a home builder. From that feedback, we've created these objectives that we live by every day:

Homes that use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
People who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Financing programs that are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Warranty programs that fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.

These things may seem like simple ideas but they're important. We want you to love the home we build for you. Trust us to build it for you.



                Building New
                
Build New
We've been building homes for more than a century. When you've been doing something that long you learn a few things. You learn the right way to build. You learn that people matter. And you learn that the real staying power is in giving people a home that they want and one you know is built to last. That last one's pretty important, don't you think?
What this means for you is our homes are built to exacting standards and are built by quality people who understand that your home is the most important home they can build. And they're built to give you the lifestyle you want, no matter what life stage you and your family currently occupy.



                Customer Referrals
                
Customer Referrals
We take things like quality construction, superior design and customer service very seriously. It's your home. You've trusted us to build it for you. That means something.
That's why it matters to us what you think of the Taylor Morrison home that you buy. Reviews matter. What you think of our homes matters.
We want to hear from you. We want to know what you think. Only then can we create the best home possible for you and your family.



                An Award-Winning Builder
                
An Award-Winning Builder
Here's the plain truth: Your new home is as important to us as it is to you and your family. There, we said it. We work hard to deliver well-built homes and we stand behind what we build. Our commitment to quality gets right to the point:

Our homes use design to create spaces that work for you and your family.
Our craftsmanship doesn't cut corners and pays attention to even the smallest detail.
Our people are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
Our communities are built in locations close to excellent schools, shopping and services
Our neighborhoods have plenty of high-quality amenities and public areas
Our financing programs are clear to understand and save you time and money.
Our warranty programs fix what's wrong and provide you with peace of mind.




                Your Dream Home
                
Your Dream Home
At Taylor Morrison, "inspired by you" is more than just a catchphrase…it's our passion. And it's that passion that we call on to deliver your dream home. We want you and your family to love the home you own. We want you to be happy in a Taylor Morrison home.
We think experience matters. More than 100 years of building experience is built into every Taylor Morrison home. Perhaps that's why we are one of the top home builders in the United States.
Today, Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes communities are currently under construction in the Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, drawing accolades from home buyers and industry experts alike. 



                Standing Behind Our Homes
                
Standing Behind Our Homes
Every home we build is backed by one of the best limited warranties in the business. Your new home is covered for any repairs outside of normal maintenance as well as for any major structural defects. How can we do this? Simple. We can offer these assurances because we select quality materials, employ select trade partners and insist on construction techniques proven over time.
Our confidence in our warranty is a reflection of the confidence we have in the homes that we build. But you know what's even better? When you feel just as confident. That's what matters.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Taylor Morrison Home Corp.: Cramer's Top Takeaways









Scott Rutt




May 17, 2017 6:26 AM EDT













 












































































 Did you miss "Mad Money" on CNBC? If so, here are some of Jim Cramer's top takeaways.   For an "Executive Decision" segment, Cramer sat down with Sheryl Palmer, president and CEO of Taylor Morrison Home Corp  (TMHC) , the home builder that operates in 20 markets across eight states and has seen orders grow by 33% this past quarter. Palmer said that her company's growth puts the company exactly where they planned to be in the high-single digits, and she remains cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. She said her company's over-50 communities continue to thrive, with each one offering a lifestyle experience that experienced home buyers can appreciate. Palmer also commented on the several secondary offerings of stock the company has done to accommodate Taylor Morrison's private equity backers exiting their positions. She said that their investors have been terrific and it's only normal to expect them to take profits after four years as a public company. When asked about their use of cash, especially if tax cuts are enacted, Palmer said they continue to be opportunistic in the land market and will keep investing in growth and their people. She said with the consumer starting to feel better, now's the perfect time to make those investments. Meanwhile, over on Real Money, Cramer says the stock market, like nature, abhors a vacuum. There's no way all of this money that's been made in the stock market leaves the stock market, he says. Get more on his insights with a free trial subscription to Real Money. Cramer and the AAP team say that after Citi (C) has rallied in recent weeks, they're taking profits on a portion of their position.

Buy with Confidence from a Builder You Can Trust
Along with style and selection, what can you expect when you visit a Taylor Morrison community? A customer service experience second to none, which is why we were voted America’s Most Trusted™ Homebuilder in 2016 in an independent survey of homebuyers across the country.

We’re proud of those honors and we continually strive to live up to them. We’re also proud to give back to the communities where we live and work. Here in Orlando, we support worthwhile local charities including Ronald McDonald House, Habitat for Humanity and Boys and Girls Clubs.
