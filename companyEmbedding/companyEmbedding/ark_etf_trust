          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

INNOVATION IS KEY TO GROWTH
Innovation is disrupting our world at an accelerated rate and creating more general purpose technologies than ever before. This rapid change facilitates convergence across different sectors of the economy leading to exponential industry growth.
Over time, innovation will displace industry incumbents, increase efficiencies, and gain majority market share. It is up to investors to understand the opportunities and invest at the pace of innovation.

*Lipsey, R.G., K.I. Carlaw and C. Bekar (2005): Economic Transformations: General Purpose Technologies, and Long-Term Economic Growth, Oxford: Oxford University Press. For more information click here.

ARK Innovation ETFs are for investors who are passionate about the future, believing that innovation is key to growth.


“Disruptors’ stocks will play a much bigger role in broad based benchmarks over time. In core indices, like the Russell 1000 and 3000, equities like Illumina and Tesla are presently “under-weighted” relative to the impact they are going to have on the world. In absolute terms, the risk to performance during the next few years will be in not owning disruptive company stocks.”
– Catherine D. Wood | CEO/CIO ARK Invest

*Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance data quoted represents past performance and current returns may be lower or higher. The  investment return and principal will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns for less than one year are not annualized. Net asset value (“NAV”) returns are based on the dollar value of a single share of the ETF, calculated using the value of the underlying assets of the ETF minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is typically calculated at 4:00 pm Eastern time on each business day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Market returns are based on the trade price at which shares are bought and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. using the last share trade. Market performance does not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Total Return reflects reinvestment of distributions on ex-date for NAV returns and payment date for Market Price returns. The market price of the ETF’s shares may differ significantly from their NAV during periods of market volatility.

The Premium/Discount chart shows the difference between the daily market price of the Fund’s shares and the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). The daily market price is calculated using the mid-point between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount of the Mid-Point price as a percentage of the NAV. The horizontal axis shows the number of trading days covered by the chart, and each bar in the chart demonstrates how many days the Fund traded within the given premium/discount range. The data presented in the chart and table above represent past performance and cannot be used to predict future results.

What are ETFs? | A Simple Explanation on Exchange Traded Funds






























































 
 








WHAT ARE ETFs?
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in different segments of our economy. For example, ARK’s ETFs are designed to give investors an easy way to access innovation areas.
Exchange
ETFs are listed on various exchanges like NASDAQ, NYSE, or BATS.
Traded
ETFs act similar to stocks when traded. An investor can trade an ETF during market hours like trading shares of an equity. Simply call up a broker or log onto an online brokerage and put in an order.
Fund
An ETF is a portfolio of securities, much like a mutual fund. ETFs can be based off an existing index, or a unique mixture determined by the fund manager.



Due to a list of benefits as shown below, ETFs are becoming more and more popular. They are an effective tool for different investment strategies and enable individual investors to obtain economies of scale. An ETF allows investors to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day.


ETF BENEFITS

Liquidity
ETFs possess two different types of liquidity, making them easily tradable. First, ETF shares are bought and sold like a stock on an exchange, making it easy for investors to trade the ETF. Second, ETFs possess an underlying liquidity due to their unique creation and redemption process, so low trading volume should not impact an investor’s ability to trade the ETF during market hours.
Transparency
ETFs disclose their holdings daily. Passive ETF holdings should reflect the index to which they are tethered. Active ETFs are similarly transparent and required by the SEC to disclose the holdings everyday. Mutual funds are not required to disclose their holdings daily, and stocks are naturally transparent as a single security.
Diversification
ETFs are packaged and sold as a unique collection of securities. Holding one ETF could offer an investor exposure to hundreds of securities, instead of just buying and selling individual stocks and bonds.
Tax Efficiency
The ETF creation and redemption process, which uses in-kind transfers of securities, makes index ETFs relatively more tax efficient when compared to mutual funds and stocks. Mutual funds are taxed when a manager sells securities within the fund and a capital gain is distributed. A tax must be paid on a stock every time it is sold.
Low Cost
ETF expense ratios generally are lower than mutual funds. According to Morningstar Research, the average ETF expense ratio in 2014 was 0.44%, which compares to 1.25% the average mutual fund charges. Compared to buying single stocks, mutual fund and ETF investors bear their pro rata share of the fund’s brokerage cost but do not pay the full brokerage fees for several individual stocks to gain broader exposure to a segment of the market.

*Comparison tables are intended to provide a general overview. Benefits and fee structure may vary from fund to fund. Diversification may not protect against market risk. Management fees associated with fund investments are not borne by investors in individual stocks or bonds. This material is not intended to be tax advice. The tax efficiencies associated with index or passive ETFs do not apply to actively managed ETFs. The tax consequences of dividend distributions may vary by individual taxpayer. Please consult your tax professional or financial adviser for more information with regard to your specific situation.




WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTIVE AND INDEX ETFs?

Active ETFs
Active ETF management is based on research and the portfolio manager’s discretion within the investment policies of the ETF, as with an active mutual fund. Most ETFs in the active space are based on pre-existing strategies, just in a different wrapper. Because the manager is picking stocks based on research, actively managed funds are not tethered to an index.
Index (Passive) ETFs
Index or Passive ETFs are tethered to an underlying index, like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Fund management is focused on matching the underlying index, instead of making decisions based on fundamental or quantitative research. A index ETF follows its underlying index as its benchmark.

Questions related to ARK Innovation ETFs:


  How do I use ARK ETFs in my portfolio?   ARK believes that investors can use ARK ETFs as a tool to diversify their investment portfolios, as part of a long-term growth strategy, or as a hedge against rapid change. 
For more information please click here to visit our How To Invest? page.
  
  What is the fee structure of ARK ETFs?   For information on the annual expense ratio of the ARK Index ETFs, please visit our ETF pages: PRNT, IZRL.
The annual expense ratio of each Active ARK ETF is 0.75%, or $75 per year for every $10,000 invested. These ARK ETFs are fully actively managed (similar to mutual funds).
The ARK ETFs do not charge sales loads or 12b-1 fees.
  
  Why do ARK Active ETFs invest in all market capitalizations?   Each of ARK’s active ETFs invests in a wide range of companies, from mega caps to micro caps, that ARK believes are going to contribute to and benefit from the rapidly changing market landscape. Small cap companies may offer a higher growth opportunity, whereas large cap companies may offer less volatility.
  
  What does “cross-sector” mean?   Unlike traditional investment strategies that specialize in certain narrowly focused sectors of the economy, the ARK active ETFs are theme-based and not constrained by economic sector. Instead, the ARK active ETFs have cross sector portfolios in order to uncover disruptive innovation that impacts multiple industries.
  
  Where can I buy ARK ETFs?   ARK Active ETFs trade on the New York Stock Exchange while ARK Index ETFs are expected to trade on the BATS Exchange once they commence operations. Investors can purchase the ARK ETFs through broker-dealers. Brokers will need a security identifier such as the ticker symbol, CUSIP, or ISIN, located on the webpage for each ARK ETF. The ARK ETFs can be traded at any time during the normal U.S. trading hours.

What differentiates ARK?
We seek to help investors recognize the true market potential of disruptive innovation and capture investment opportunities appropriately. ARK ETFs are freed from traditional constraints (sectors, market caps, or geographic boundaries) and are created based on full-picture, top-down research, and classic bottom-up financial analysis. The result, a low correlation to traditional growth and value strategies, offering attractive long-term performance and capital appreciation.

Questions related to Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs):


  What are ETFs?   ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund.
ETFs are listed on various exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), BATS Exchange, or NASDAQ. An ETF is a portfolio of securities, much like a mutual fund. ETFs can be based off an existing index, or can be a unique mixture of holdings determined by the fund manager. When traded, ETFs act like a stock: An investor can trade an ETF during market hours like trading a share of an equity. Simply call up a broker or log onto an online brokerage and put in an order.
For more information click here.
  
  How liquid are ETFs?   ETFs possess two different types of liquidity, making them easily tradable. First, ETF shares are bought and sold like a stock on an exchange, making it easy for investors to trade the ETF. Second, ETFs possess an underlying liquidity due to their unique creation and redemption process, so low trading volume should not impact an investor’s ability to trade the ETF during market hours.
For more information, please read the following article: Understanding ETF Liquidity
  
  What are the tax implications when investing in ETFs?   Index (or Passive) ETFs may offer tax advantages relative to mutual funds due to their structure and unique creation and redemption process. The creation and redemption processes used by index ETFs are designed to mitigate adverse effects on an ETF’s portfolio that could arise from frequent cash purchase and redemption transactions that affect the net asset value of the ETF.
In contrast to conventional mutual funds, where frequent redemptions can have an adverse tax impact on taxable shareholders because of the need to sell portfolio securities which, in turn, may generate taxable gain, the in-kind redemption mechanism of an index ETF, to the extent used, generally is not expected to lead to a tax event for shareholders. The actively managed ARK ETFs (ARKQ, ARKG, ARKW, and ARKK) are not permitted to reconstitute their portfolios through the use of custom baskets (and in-kind transfers).
As a result, the actively managed ARK ETFs are subject to trading-related short-term and long-term capital gains and losses. In addition, the actively managed ARK ETFs may make distributions annually that generally will be taxed as ordinary income. Other possible tax implications may occur when shares are sold in the secondary market or a creation or redemption unit is created. Tax consequences will vary by individual.
  
  What are the differences between Active and Index ETFs?   Index (or Passive) ETFs are tethered to an underlying index, like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Fund management is focused on matching the underlying index, instead of making decisions based on research. A passive ETF follows its underlying index as its benchmark.
ARK developed its indices based on thematic research that highlighted niche areas of innovation.
Active ETF management is based on research and the portfolio manager’s discretion with the investment policies of the ETF, as with an active mutual fund. Most ETFs in the active space are based on pre-existing strategies, just in a different wrapper. Because the manager is picking stocks based on research, actively managed funds are not tethered to an index.
  
   How do ETFs differ from Mutual Funds?   An ETF is similar to a mutual fund in that it offers investors a proportionate share in a pool of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Also, like a mutual fund, an ETF is required to post the marked-to-market net asset value (NAV) of its portfolio at the end of each trading day. One major difference is that investors buy and sell ETF shares on a stock exchange through broker-dealers, much as they would trade individual stocks. In contrast, mutual fund shares are not listed on stock exchanges. Retail investors buy and sell mutual fund shares through a variety of distribution channels, including directly from a fund company or through a financial adviser or broker-dealer.
Mutual funds and ETFs are also priced differently. Mutual funds are “forward priced.” Investors can place orders to buy or sell shares throughout the day, but all orders received during the day will receive the same price—the fund’s NAV at the next time it is computed. Most mutual funds calculate their NAV as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time because that is the time U.S. stock exchanges typically close. In contrast, the market price of an ETF share is continuously determined through trading on a stock exchange. Consequently, the price at which investors buy and sell ETF shares may not necessarily equal the NAV of the portfolio of securities in the ETF. In addition, two investors selling the same ETF shares at different times on the same day may receive different prices for their shares, both of which may differ from the ETF’s NAV. (Source: Investment Company Institute.)
  
  What are the benefits of ETFs?   Liquidity
ETFs trade on an exchange like a stock, thus they have similar liquidity and investors can trade them throughout market hours.
Transparency
ETFs disclose their holdings daily. Passive ETF holdings should reflect the index to which they are tethered. Active ETFs are similarly transparent and required by the SEC to disclose the holdings everyday. Mutual funds are not required to disclose their holdings daily, and stocks are naturally transparent as a single security.
Diversification
ETFs are packaged and sold as a unique collection of securities. Holding one ETF could offer an investor exposure to hundreds of securities, instead of just buying and selling individual stocks and bonds.
Tax Efficiency
The ETF creation and redemption process, which uses in-kind transfers of securities, makes index ETFs relatively more tax efficient when compared to mutual funds and stocks. Mutual funds are taxed when a manager sells securities within the fund and a capital gain is distributed. A tax must be paid on a stock every time it is sold.
Low Cost
ETF expense ratios generally are lower than mutual funds. According to Morningstar Research, the average ETF expense ratio in 2014 was 0.44%, which compares to 1.25% the average mutual fund charges. Compared to buying single stocks, mutual fund and ETF investors bear their pro rata share of the fund’s brokerage cost but do not pay the full brokerage fees for several individual stocks to gain broader exposure to a segment of the market.

Other Questions:


  What are the benefits of transparency?   ARK seeks to invest in innovation that will make the world a better place by allocating capital to its best and most advantageous use.  We also believe that the financial industry will benefit from more transparency. In a recovering market, regaining the trust of the investor and consumer is crucial. We want investors to see what they have invested in every day and comprehend the risk in order to understand the value of their investment, so they can watch as our portfolios match the pace of innovation.
  
  What is Disruptive Innovation?   Disruptive innovation is the introduction of a technologically enabled new product or service that permanently changes an industry by creating simplicity and accessibility while driving down costs.
For more information click here to visit our What is Disruptive Innovation page.
  
  What is Thematic Investing?   Thematic investing captures long-term trends that cut across sectors and geographic boundaries. It recognizes that the world is changing rapidly and incorporates a deep understanding of the underlying disruptive innovations that drive long-term value creation and risk.
In the actively managed ARK ETFs, ARK is focused on investing in promising areas of disruptive innovation and nonlinear change. The starting point for our research is from the top down. Our current research themes are the Genomic Revolution, Industrial Innovation, and Web x.0, covering such elements as genetic breakthroughs, the third industrial revolution, and web-based transformation. We believe that all of these themes and their elements are combining to disrupt most industries in the United States and around the world. These broad themes include companies across sectors and market capitalizations.
For more information please click here to visit our Investor Education Section.
  
  Why Is the theme called Genomic Revolution?   Genetics and genomic sequencing are the catalysts for innovation across multiple sectors including health care, agriculture, and technology. Greater knowledge in these areas will build a platform for innovation beyond what we currently understand. The falling price of genomic sequencing has enabled scientists to work at a pace previously unachieved to decipher the language of life. Combined with new capabilities in big data storage, we can better understand our past and future and apply that understanding to the present.
  
  Why is the theme called Web x.0?   The Internet permeates our lives and affects every facet of industry. Initially, the web was static HTML (known retroactively as “Web 1.0”) and lacked connectivity. After the dot-com bubble popped, the Internet evolved into a social creature, “Web 2.0” of the late 2000s. The most recent iteration is “Web x.0.” We believe the open-ended web will transform the lives of individuals and businesses in more profound ways, most of which we cannot even imagine now.
  
  Why is the theme called Industrial Innovation?   Innovation is in the process of transforming the industrial sector as dramatically as genomics and the web are changing other sectors. Advances in technology have enabled breakthroughs in energy storage, electric and autonomous cars, 3D printing, nanomaterials, robotics, and space exploration. These elements are affecting the core processes and products of manufacturing.

ARK Innovation ETFs are for investors who are passionate about the future, believing that innovation is key to growth.


“Disruptors’ stocks will play a much bigger role in broad based benchmarks over time. In core indices, like the Russell 1000 and 3000, equities like Illumina and Tesla are presently “under-weighted” relative to the impact they are going to have on the world. In absolute terms, the risk to performance during the next few years will be in not owning disruptive company stocks.”
– Catherine D. Wood | CEO/CIO ARK Invest

HOW TO USE ARK INNOVATION ETFs


ARK believes that the path to creating a well-balanced portfolio is by combining both higher and lower risk investments. Through a thematic focus, ARK ETFs are designed to offer uncorrelated alpha* through portfolios that provide little overlap with traditional growth and value investment strategies.
The ARK ETFs can be used as part of an investor’s long-term growth strategy, as a satellite strategy to diversify core portfolios, or as a hedge against rapid change. Over time, such a well-balanced portfolio has the potential to deliver higher returns than risk-averse strategies.
Growth Strategy
10-15% of a Growth Portfolio


Adding a portfolio with low correlation to traditional growth strategies can lower risk and increase return over a full market cycle.
Satellite Strategy
4-5% of an Equity Portfolio


Aiming to provide a sustainable alpha* sleeve against broad based benchmarks for an investor’s core portfolio.
Hedge
Tool for Investor Hedge


Using an ARK ETF as a hedge against rapid change that would likely cause turmoil to traditional broad based index strategies.

*Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance data quoted represents past performance and current returns may be lower or higher. The  investment return and principal will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns for less than one year are not annualized. Net asset value (“NAV”) returns are based on the dollar value of a single share of the ETF, calculated using the value of the underlying assets of the ETF minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is typically calculated at 4:00 pm Eastern time on each business day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Market returns are based on the trade price at which shares are bought and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. using the last share trade. Market performance does not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Total Return reflects reinvestment of distributions on ex-date for NAV returns and payment date for Market Price returns. The market price of the ETF’s shares may differ significantly from their NAV during periods of market volatility.

The Premium/Discount chart shows the difference between the daily market price of the Fund’s shares and the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). The daily market price is calculated using the mid-point between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount of the Mid-Point price as a percentage of the NAV. The horizontal axis shows the number of trading days covered by the chart, and each bar in the chart demonstrates how many days the Fund traded within the given premium/discount range. The data presented in the chart and table above represent past performance and cannot be used to predict future results.

		The 5 Hottest Tech ETFs of 2017	
These lesser known tech ETFs track the hottest technology trends and have been surging this year

Technology sector has been the best performer among all S&P sectors this year, rising 9.5% year-to-date and handily beating the 5.3% return posted by the broader S&P 500 index. The sector also outperformed other asset classes from gold to real estate.

Tech companies did not participate in the initial post-election rally as they were seen as exposed to the risks of trade wars and anti-immigration stance. At the same time, they were expected to be the big beneficiaries of tax repatriation holiday promised by Trump.  (Read: 4 Sector ETFs to Profit if Geopolitics Rule)
But this year, investors have dialed back expectations for a Trump bump, particularly after the failure of the Healthcare reforms. Financials, which had surged late last year on hopes of higher rates, deregulation and tax cuts, are lagging this year, with sector return less than 1%.
Investors have now turned to companies that will be able to grow their earnings as the economic picture brightens. And with the global economy picking up momentum, technology companies appear best positioned to prosper. They are also less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.
Further, this is expected to be a strong quarter for tech earnings growth with sector earnings expected to be up +10.7% from the same period last year, per Zacks Earnings Trends. (Read: 5 Unbeatable ETF Strategies for Q2)
7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years
Mega-cap tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have surged this year, driving the largest, ultra-cheap, broad tech ETFs—like the Technology SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT), but the best performers this year are some of the lesser known ETFs that track the hottest technology trends.
These are some of the disruptive technologies that will shape our futures:
ARK ETF Trust (ARKK)
ARK ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is an actively managed product tracking companies that benefit from innovation, improvements and advancements in one of three areas–industrial innovation, genomics or Web x.0. It follows the investment theme of disruptive innovation.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are among the top holdings. The fund is not cheap—it charges 75 basis points for operating expenses, which is in-line with some other actively managed niche funds. (Read: Ride on Surging Tesla with These ETFs)
Further, it has so far managed to attract only $19 million in AUM, leading to high trading expenses. It is more suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance.
The fund is up more than 20% year-to-date and about 22% since its inception in October 2014.
Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL)
Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) provides access to a broad basket to social media companies around the world. The social media giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) which has rallied hard this year, is one of the top holdings.
It has gathered about $89 million in AUM. About half of its assets are invested internationally, mainly in Chinese (27%) and Japanese (9%) companies. Strong performance by Chinese tech giants is one of the reasons behind the ETF’s outperformance.
The product charges 65 basis points for fees and has risen about 15% this year.
PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio (PNQI)
PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust (NASDAQ:PNQI) tracks the performance of the largest and most liquid US-listed companies engaged in internet-related businesses.
Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook, Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Amazon are among the top holdings. The product has about 13% of its assets invested in international companies.
It has risen more than 14% in 2017 and has an expense ratio of 60 basis points. The product has gathered about $317 million in assets so far.

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (which may charge commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you will pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
