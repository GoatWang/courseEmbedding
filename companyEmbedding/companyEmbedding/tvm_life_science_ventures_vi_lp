European specialty pharmaceutical group of companies with the
vision to become one of the leading suppliers of specialty urology
and endocrinology products to the European market place. For this
purpose and in order to regulate the legal relationship among
themselves as future shareholders of the Company, Valera and the

deed for incorporation of the Company shall be executed.



(2)
 
The Shareholders shall adopt articles of association for the
Company in the form set out in Appendix 1.2.






(3)

service agreement at terms and conditions as set forth in
Appendix 1.3.






(4)
 
The Shareholders shall appoint Messrs. David Tierney,
James Gale, Hubert Birner and Bernd Seibel as members of the
Company’s initial supervisory board. The Parties shall, to
the extent legally permissible and respecting the independence of
the supervisory board and its members, use their best efforts and
all the influence they have to the effect that the supervisory
board adopts the Rules of Procedure for the Management as set forth
in Appendix 1.4 immediately upon their
appointment.

(5)
 
LSOFI and LSOF undertake to grant to the Company, immediately

and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement as attached
hereto as Appendix 1.5 .



Sec.
2
First
Capital Increase



(1)
 
If the Company requires additional funds, it shall inform the
Shareholders accordingly in writing. Each Investor shall, within
six weeks as of receipt of such information, notify the Company and
the Shareholders whether such Investor supports the additional
funding. If Investors, who hold (together) a Qualified
Investor Majority (as defined in Sec. 23 (1) below), notify the
Company and the Shareholders within such six weeks period of their
support of the additional funding, the Company shall without delay
call for a written shareholders resolution of an increase of the
Company’s share capital from EUR 18,466.92 by up to EUR
25,536.83 to up to EUR 44,003.75 by issuing new shares in the
Company (the “ First Capital Increase ”) to
Valera and the Investors. All Shareholders shall participate in,
and vote in favour of, the resolution on the First Capital
Increase, waiving all requirements as to the form and time period
for calling such shareholders resolution.






(2)
 
The Investors shall then each be entitled and obliged to
subscribe for the Company’s new
            shares
from the First Capital Increase and make payments in the following
amounts (with the term “cost” referring to Sec. 23
(4) below):

The payments
set forth above in this Sec. 2 (2) shall be effected, within
one week after the resolution on the First Capital Increase has
been taken, to a notary’s third party account, instructing
the notary to pay these amounts to the Company upon the execution
of the notarial deed on the First Capital Increase and issuance of
the new shares as set forth in the above table.



(3)
 
Immediately upon payment of all of the above stated amounts,
but in any event after the lapse of four weeks as of the
Shareholders’ resolution on the First Capital Increase, the
Company shall inform Valera on the extent to which the First
Capital Increase has been subscribed and paid pursuant to Sec. 2
(2), and shall offer to issue to Valera 19.9% of the entire new
shares from the First Capital Increase (i.e., the aggregate amount
of the new shares subscribed and paid for pursuant to Sec. 2
(2) plus the shares to be allotted to Valera pursuant to this
Sec. 2 (3) so that following such issuance Valera would own
19.9%, or – in case of Sec. 6 (2) – 19.4%, of the
outstanding shares of the Company) at a price that equals such
shares’ nominal amount. Valera shall subscribe and pay for
those shares within one week as of receipt of such offer, or the
offer shall lapse. Valera’s payment shall be made to the same
notary’s third party account as used for the purpose of Sec.
2 (2), equally instructing the notary to pay these amounts to the
Company upon the execution of the notarial deed on the First
Capital Increase and issuance of the respective new shares to
Valera.






(4)
 
In addition to the payment set forth to be made to the Company
by ARCADE in the table in Sec. 2 (2), ARCADE hereby commits towards
the Shareholders, but without obliging itself towards the Company,
and provided that the Company has not filed for insolvency or has
become obliged to file for insolvency prior to such payment, to
make an additional payment of EUR 324,082 minus cost (see Sec. 23
(4) below) into the Company’s capital reserves at the
latest immediately prior to any of the following events: (i) a
Trade Sale (as defined in Sec. 12 (1) below); (ii) an initial
public offering of shares of the Company; (iii) the
liquidation of the Company (but not in the context of an
insolvency); and (iv) any transfer of any shares by ARCADE
except for share transfers under Sec. 15 (1) if the acquirer
assumes this payment obligation. Nothing in this Sec. 2
(4) shall be interpreted to grant to the Company any right or
claim to the additional payment by ARCADE.



Sec.
3

Second Capital Increase



(1)
 
If after implementation of the First Capital Increase the
Company requires additional funds, it shall inform the Shareholders
accordingly in writing. Each Investor shall, within six weeks as of
receipt of such information, notify the Company and the
Shareholders whether such Investor supports the additional funding.
If Investors, who hold (together) a Qualified Investor
Majority (as defined in Sec. 23 (1) below), notify the Company
and the Shareholders within such six weeks period of their support
of the additional funding, the Company shall without delay call for
a written shareholders resolution of a further increase of the
Company’s share capital by up to EUR 23,691.64 by issuing new
shares in the Company (the “ Second Capital Increase
”) to Valera and the Investors. All Shareholders shall
participate in, and vote in favour of, the resolution on the Second
Capital Increase, waiving all requirements as to the form and time
period for calling such shareholders resolution.






(2)
 
The Investors shall then each be entitled and obliged to

Such payments
shall be effected, within one week after the resolution on the
Second Capital Increase has been taken, to a notary’s third
party account, instructing the notary to pay these amounts to the
Company upon the execution of the notarial deed on the Second
Capital Increase and issuance of the new shares as set forth in the
above table.



(3)
 
Immediately upon payment of all of the above stated amounts,
but in any event after the lapse of four weeks as of the
Shareholders’ resolution on the Second Capital Increase, the
Company shall inform Valera on the extent to which the Second
Capital Increase has been subscribed and paid pursuant to Sec. 3
(2), and shall offer to issue to Valera 19.9%, or – in case
of Sec. 6 (2) – 19.4%, of the entire new shares from the
Second Capital Increase (i.e., the aggregate amount of the new
shares subscribed and paid for pursuant to Sec. 3 (2) plus the
shares to be allotted to Valera pursuant to this Sec. 3 (3) so
that following such issuance Valera would own 19.9%, or – in
case of Sec. 6 (2) – 19.4%, of the outstanding shares of the
Company, provided that Valera has fully subscribed to the shares
offered to Valera pursuant to Sec. 2 (3)) at a price that equals
such shares’ nominal amount. Valera shall subscribe and pay
for those shares within one week as of receipt of such offer, or
the offer shall lapse. Valera’s payment shall be made to the
same notary’s third party account as used for the purpose of
Sec. 3 (2), equally instructing the notary to pay these amounts to
the Company upon the execution of the notarial deed on the Second
Capital Increase and issuance of the respective new shares to
Valera.






(4)
 
In addition to the payment set forth to be made to the Company
by ARCADE in the table in Sec. 3 (2), ARCADE hereby commits towards
the Shareholders, but without obliging itself towards the Company,
and provided that the Company has not filed for insolvency or has
become obliged to file for insolvency prior to such payment, to
make an additional payment of EUR 349,464 (on top of the additional
payment under Sec. 2 (2) above) into the Company’s
capital reserves at the latest immediately prior to any of the
following events: (i) a Trade Sale (as defined in Sec. 12
(1) below); (ii) an initial public offering of shares of
the Company; (iii) the liquidation of the Company (but not in
the context of an insolvency); and (iv) any transfer of any
shares by ARCADE except for share transfers under Sec. 15
(1) if the acquirer assumes this payment obligation. Nothing
in this Sec. 3 (4) shall be interpreted to grant to the
Company any right or claim to the additional payment by
ARCADE.



Sec.
4
General Obligations with regard to Capital Increases /
Syndication



(1)
 
To the extent necessary to implement Secs. 2 and 3, the
Shareholders shall waive their statutory subscription rights for
the First and Second Capital Increase.




37 



 







(2)
 
The Parties shall make any and all statements and undertake any
and all actions necessary or appropriate, including the
co-operation with the execution of any relevant notarial deeds, to
implement the aforesaid resolutions set out in Secs. 1 to 3 as soon
as reasonably practicable.






(3)
 
Each of the Investors listed on the cover page of this
Agreement shall be entitled to transfer and assign its rights and
obligations to subscribe and pay for shares from the First and
Second Capital Increase to a third party, provided that such third
party (i) meets the approval of Shareholders who hold
(together) a majority of the shares held by all Shareholders
at the time of the approval, and (ii) accedes to this
Agreement as an Investor by a syndication and accession agreement
as set forth in draft form as Appendix 4.3a hereto,
which shall be accepted on behalf of all Parties by the respective
Investor who transfers and assigns its rights and obligations. The
same requirements shall apply to the third party investor or third
party investors envisaged in Secs. 2(2) and 3(2) to invest in the
First and Second Capital Increase, except that in such case, such
third party investor shall accede to this Agreement as an Investor
by an accession agreement as set forth in draft form as Appendix
4.3b , which shall be accepted on behalf of all Parties by any
of the Investors.



Sec.
5
Default on Investment Obligation



(1)
 
If an Investor fails (i) to subscribe for shares from the
First or Second Capital Increase, or (ii) to make any of the
payments under Sec. 2 (2) and 3 (2), in each case within the
time period provided for with regard to such subscription or
payment in the respective Sections above plus a grace period of one
additional week (“ Default ”), such
Investor’s right to acquire shares from the respective First
or Second Capital Increase shall lapse. In addition, such Investor
(the “ Defaulting Investor ”) shall be obliged
to transfer 50% of the shares held by such Investor at that time to
the other Shareholders (who shall be entitled to acquire such
shares pro rata to their shareholdings) for an aggregate
consideration of EUR 1, such amount to be pro rated among the
Shareholders receiving such transferred shares. The share transfer
shall be implemented without delay upon the lapse of the respective
applicable time period plus the grace period of one week, and the
Defaulting Investor shall, in particular, provide all co-operation
needed for the execution of the notarial deed of the share
transfer. Secs. 9 – 11 of this Agreement shall not apply to
such share transfer. The Company shall immediately inform all
Shareholders of such lapse of time and failure to subscribe or make
payments.






(2)
 
Each Investor hereby assigns, subject to the condition
precedent that he commits a Default, all of the Relevant Claims (as
defined hereinafter) to all other Shareholders (at the time of
Default) pro rata to their shareholdings at the time of Default.
The Relevant Claims are 50% of all claims of the Defaulting
Investor for dividends, liquidation proceeds, trade sale proceeds
and redemption compensation with respect to all of the shares held
by him at the time of Default, provided, however, that such claims
arise or become payable in the time period between the Default and
the share transfer pursuant to Sec. 5 (1).



Sec.
6

Valera’s Covenant to obtain Shire Waiver/Licence



(1)
 
Valera hereby undertakes to obtain from Shire US Inc. a license
to the Development Data for the development, manufacture, use,
supply and sale of the Licensed Product in Ireland (each
capitalised term as defined in the Termination Agreement, License
Back and Option dated 21 December 2001 between Hydro Med
Sciences, Inc. (n/k/a Valera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and Shire US
Inc.).






(2)
 
If Valera fails to obtain from Shire such license by the lapse
of six months as of the date of incorporation of the Company,
Valera shall transfer to the Company without consideration such
number of Valera’s shares which represent 0.5% of the entire
outstanding shares of the Company at that time. All Parties shall
in such event, without delay upon the lapse of six




38 



 




 
 
months after the incorporation of the Company, take all steps,
measures and resolutions necessary to implement such share
transfer, including – but not limited to – the
shareholders resolution on the Company’s acquisition of such
shares and the Company’s consent to such share transfer.
Secs. 9 – 11 shall not apply to such share transfer.



Sec.
7
Other
Covenants



(1)
 
Valera and the Investors shall ensure that immediately upon the
Company’s incorporation the Company will accede to this
Agreement by signing it.






(2)
 
Valera hereby offers to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
the conclusion of the Licence and Distribution Agreement set out in
Appendix 7.2 , and all Parties shall ensure that the
Company or its appropriate subsidiary without delay accepts such
offer and enters into said Distribution and Licence Agreement upon
the Company’s or the appropriate subsidiary’s
incorporation.






(3)
 
It is the parties’ joint intention that the Company sets
up subsidiaries and a structure as set out in
Appendix 7.3 as amended from time to time by the
Company’s management with the approval of the Company’s
supervisory board. The Parties shall make any and all statements
and undertake any and all actions necessary or appropriate to
implement the aforesaid structure as soon as reasonably
practicable, provided, however, that no Shareholder shall be
obliged under this Sec. 7.3 to accept or enter into any financial
obligations other than expressly provided for in this Agreement.
The Parties agree to procure that the articles of association or
similar instruments of any future subsidiaries of the Company will
be established in such a manner that they will provide that prior
approval of the respective subsidiary’s shareholders meeting
shall be required for those resolutions or actions by such
subsidiary’s management for which, if such resolution or
action was to be taken by the management of the Company, the
management would require the consent of the Company’s
supervisory board, thus ensuring that any such resolution or action
ultimately requires the consent of the supervisory board of the
Company.






(4)
 
All Parties shall ensure that the Company without delay upon
its incorporation issues the Management Rights Letter attached in
draft form as Appendix 7.4 hereto to TVM LP as well as
to TVM KG. By signing and acceding to this Agreement, the Company
undertakes to issue such Management Right Letters without
delay.



Sec.
8

Intellectual Property Rights



(1)
 
The parties agree that JFLAB does not have any rights in or
relating to intellectual property rights (including, without
limitation, any inventions, patents, copyrights and other
industrial property rights, especially with a view to software and
related materials or rights for remuneration) (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “ IP Rights ”)
in the field of speciality urology and endocrinology products (the
“ Field ”). For the avoidance of doubt, JFLAB
hereby offers to transfer to the Company or the appropriate
subsidiary, to the extent legally possible, any and all IP Rights
owned by him in the Field without any additional compensation.
Where such transfer is not possible for any legal reasons, JFLAB
herewith offers to grant to the Company or the appropriate
subsidiary an exclusive and irrevocable licence to use such IP
Rights for all currently known uses without any fee or other
consideration being payable. The offered grant of licence is as
broad as legally possible and shall specifically, without
limitation, be unlimited (in respect of duration, territorial scope
and scope of the rights concerned), exclusive, transferable and
shall include the right to modify the IP Rights and to grant
sub-licences to third parties. The licence shall also include the
permanent or temporary reproduction of the work results by any
means and in any form, in part or in whole, the loading,
displaying, running, transmission or storage of the work results,
the translation,




39 



 




 
 
adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of the work
results and the reproduction of the results thereof, without
prejudice to the rights of the person who alters the work results,
any form of distribution to the public, including the rental, of
the original work results or of copies thereof, and the right to
make available to the public the work results by any means.






(2)
 
Where the above transfer of rights and the grant of licences
requires any further deeds, acts or declarations, JFLAB agrees to
give and make any such deeds, acts and declarations forthwith. Any
costs accruing in this context shall be borne by the Company or the
appropriate subsidiary.






(3)
 
At the request of the Company or the appropriate subsidiary,
JFLAB shall demonstrate and explain all IP Rights, know-how and any
knowledge or work results in the Field to an expert named by the
Company or the appropriate subsidiary and answer all questions such
expert may have. JFLAB shall make available to the Company or the
appropriate subsidiary all of his documentation on IP Rights,
know-how and any knowledge or work results in the Field.



Sec.
9
Transfer of Shares / Notification



(1)
 
In the event that a Shareholder intends to transfer all or part
of his shares in the Company to any third person (including other
Shareholders) with or without consideration, or to enter into any
commercially equivalent transaction (the “ Selling
Shareholder ”), the Selling Shareholder shall be obliged
to notify the other Shareholders of such intent in writing (the
“ Notification ”) with a copy to the chairman of
the Company’s supervisory board.




(2)   The Notification of the Selling Shareholder
shall contain the following information:



 
a)
 
name / firm name and address / registered office of the Selling
Shareholder;


 


 
b)
 
name / firm name and address / registered office of the
prospective purchaser;


 


 
c)
 
description of business of the prospective purchaser;


 


 
d)
 
purchase price or other consideration for the proposed
transfer, if any;


 


 
e)
 
due date for payment of the purchase price and / or other
consideration, if any;


 


 
f)
 
number of shares to be transferred;


 


 
g)
 
representations and warranties as well as indemnities to be
given and covenants to be assumed by each party to the proposed
transfer.






(3)
 
If, however, the Selling Shareholder intends to transfer shares
for consideration other than cash, the Selling Shareholder shall,
for the purpose of the right of first refusal under Sec. 10,
indicate in the Notification the value of any non-cash
consideration in cash according to the consideration’s fair
market value. In the event that another Shareholder has reasonable
doubt as to the accuracy of the consideration’s value, such
Shareholder (the “ Objecting Shareholder ”)
shall inform the Selling Shareholder accordingly in writing within
two weeks as of the receipt of the Notification, indicating the
value which the Objecting Shareholder believes to be accurate, with
a copy of such information to all other Shareholders. If the
Objecting Shareholder and the Selling Shareholder do not agree
within a period of one week on the value of the non-cash
consideration or on an expert to ultimately determine the non-cash
consideration’s fair market value, such value shall be
ultimately determined by an auditor nominated by the chairman of
the Dutch Institute for Chartered Accountants ( Nederlands
Instituut voor Register Accountants – NIVRA -) (the
agreed expert or auditor nominated by NIVRA hereinafter: the
“ Expert ”). Such determination by the Expert
shall be finally binding for the purpose of the right of first
refusal under Sec. 10. The Selling Shareholder shall notify in
writing all other Shareholders of the so determined fair market
value of the non-cash consideration immediately upon its
determination with a copy to the chairman of the Company’s
supervisory board, and the Notification shall be deemed accordingly
amended with regard to the purchase price / consideration, and
received by the other Shareholders only




40 



 




 
 
upon receipt of the notification on the non-cash
consideration’s fair market value as determined by the
Expert. The cost of the Expert’s determination of the
non-cash consideration’s fair market value shall be borne by
the Objecting Shareholder, if the determined value is closer to the
Selling Shareholder’s indication of value in the
Notification, and by the Selling Shareholder if the determined
value is closer to the Objecting Shareholder’s indication of
value.



Sec.
10
Rights of First Refusal



(1)
 
In the event that a Shareholder intends to sell his present or
future shares in the Company for consideration (purchase / swap /
contribution against shareholder’s rights, etc.) the
Shareholders (other than the Selling Shareholder) shall have a
right of first refusal as set forth in the following provisions to
acquire the shares, which the Selling Shareholder intends to sell,
at the terms and conditions set forth in the Notification pursuant
to Sec. 9 (2) and (3).






(2)
 
Within 30 days of receipt of the Notification, each
Shareholder (other than the Selling Shareholder), who wishes to
exercise a right of first refusal, shall state in writing to the
Selling Shareholder the maximum number of shares (the “
Acquisition Limit ”) he is willing to acquire at the
terms and conditions set forth in the Notification pursuant to Sec.
9 (2) and (3) (hereinafter: the “ Purchase
Statement ”) with a copy to the chairman of the
Company’s supervisory board. Such statement shall be binding
in accordance with Sec. 10 (3), (4) and (5) below.






(3)
 
If the aggregate number of shares that all Shareholders (other
than the Selling Shareholder) have stated to be willing to acquire
within the aforesaid 30-day-period falls short of the aggregate
number of shares which the Selling Shareholder intends to sell
pursuant to the Notification, the Selling Shareholder shall inform
all other Shareholders accordingly, and no right of first refusal
shall apply at all. The Selling Shareholder, subject to the
Shareholders’ Tag-Along Rights pursuant to Sec. 11 and the
provisions of Sec. 14, shall be entitled to sell his shares, but
only in strict accordance with the Notification, within two months
upon the lapse of the aforesaid 30-days-period. The purchase

Dr. Qiu Yu, Chairman & President of Lummy comments: “The Chinese pharmaceutical markets have experienced rapid growth over many years now. General health awareness is on the rise resulting from sustainable overall economic growth combined with an aging society. The Chinese pharmaceutical market is becoming larger accordingly. Our mission is to provide this vibrant market with innovative, exciting, effective drugs and technology to improve human health. We believe that continuous innovation is the only route to company growth. Currently, innovations in pharmaceutical and medical technologies are mostly originated in North America and Western Europe. With our commitment to China BioPharma Capital I LP, we strive to introduce the world’s top medical services and medical technologies to the Chinese market, leveraging our understanding of the Chinese pharmaceutical markets and our innovative operating model.”
China BioPharma Capital I will focus on investments in life science innovation in Western companies with the objective to obtain licenses for development and commercialization in China. The fund will capitalize on the substantial global footprint of TVM Capital Life Science which invests into biopharmaceutical innovation from their seventh fund generation in Europe, the USA and Canada and looks back on a successful 30 years track record in financing healthcare innovation.
Dr. Hubert Birner, Managing Partner of TVM Capital Life Science says: “This new fund is an exciting opportunity to expand our reach into China and to leverage the unique deal flow and deal making capability of our Venture Capital teams in Munich and Montreal. We are very happy to welcome Mirko who will lead our efforts in China and we expect our investment team dedicated to China to grow substantially in the near future.”

Dr. Scherer co-founded GPC Biotech AG in 1997 a former TVM Capital Life Science portfolio firm – and served as its CFO over a decade. Mirko Scherer comments on the fund’s objectives: “The China BioPharma Capital I fund provides great opportunities to bridge the gap between the West and the East in the healthcare industry. The China BioPharma Capital I fund provides an ideal vehicle to combine the expertise and the network of TVM Capital Life Science in the West with the development, regulatory and sales/marketing acumen of our Chinese partner Lummy. We are looking forward to bringing many products and technologies to the Greater China area together with our strategic investor Lummy.“

of this Agreement, whether upon the exercise of options, conversion of convertible securities, exercise of warrants or by means
of purchase, dividend, distribution or otherwise, being referred to herein as the “Shares”); and
 
WHEREAS, in order to induce the Company and
the Buyers to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company and the Stockholder
hereby agree as follows:
 


 
 

 
ARTICLE I.
 
TRANSFER AND VOTING OF SHARES; AND
OTHER COVENANTS OF THE STOCKHOLDER
 
SECTION 1.1. Voting of Shares. From
the date hereof until termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof (the “Term”), at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in any action by
written consent of the stockholders of the Company, in either case at or pursuant to which the Proposal is to be considered and
voted on by the stockholders of the Company, the Stockholder shall (a) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares
to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum and (b) vote (or cause to be voted) the Shares (i)
in favor of the Proposal and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement (the “Transactions”) and (ii) against the approval or adoption of any proposal made in
opposition to, or in competition with, the Proposal or the Transactions, and against any other action that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to otherwise materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation
of the Transactions. If the Stockholder is the beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of any of the Shares, the Stockholder
agrees to cause the record holder and any nominees to vote all of such Shares in accordance with this Section 1.1, including by
executing such documentation as shall be requested by the record holder or any such nominee for purposes of giving voting instructions
thereto.
 
SECTION 1.2. Grant of Irrevocable
Proxy.
 
(a)               
The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (to the fullest extent permitted by law) grants to, and appoints, the Company
and each of its executive officers and any of them, in their capacities as officers of the Company (the “Grantees”),
as the Stockholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and re-substitution), for and in the name,
place and stead of the Stockholder, to vote the Shares, to instruct nominees or record holders to vote the Shares, or to grant
a consent or approval or dissent or disapproval in respect of the Shares, in each case in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof and,
in the discretion of the Grantees, with respect to any proposed adjournments or postponements of any meeting of stockholders of
the Company at which any of the matters described in Section 1.1 hereof are to be considered.
 
(b)              
The Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1.2 is given in connection with the execution
of the Purchase Agreement and the proposed issuance of the Preferred Shares as contemplated thereby, and that such irrevocable
proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of the Stockholder under this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby further
affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked, except as otherwise set
forth herein. The Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Grantees may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof. The irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1.2 is executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions
of Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Notwithstanding this Section 1.2, the proxy granted by the Stockholder
shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
 


 -2-
 


 
(c)               
The Grantees may not exercise this irrevocable proxy on any other matter except as provided above. 
 
SECTION 1.3. No Inconsistent Arrangements.
Except as contemplated by this Agreement, from the date hereof until the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Stockholder will not (a) directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or otherwise
dispose of in any manner any of the Shares, or consent or agree to do any of the foregoing, (b) directly or indirectly, limit
its right to vote in any manner any of the Shares (other than as set forth in this Agreement), including without limitation by
the grant of any proxy, power of attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Shares (other than any such proxy, power
of attorney or other authorization consistent with, and for purposes of complying with, the provisions of Section 1.1 hereof),
by depositing the Shares into a voting trust, or by entering into a voting agreement, or consent or agree to do any of the foregoing
or (c) take any action which would have the effect of preventing or disabling the Stockholder from performing its obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder may sell or transfer any or all of the Shares to any Person
in a private transaction at any time on or prior to the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, provided that the transferee
of such Shares executes and delivers to the Company a Voting Agreement with respect to such transferred Shares containing substantially
the same terms as this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 1.3, the term “sell” or “transfer”
or any derivatives thereof shall include, but not be limited to, (A) a sale, transfer or disposition of record or beneficial
ownership, or both and (B) a short sale with respect to the Shares or substantially identical property, entering into or acquiring
an offsetting derivative contract with respect to the Shares or substantially identical property, entering into or acquiring a
futures or forward contract to deliver the Shares or substantially identical property or entering into any transaction that has
the same effect as any of the foregoing.
 
SECTION 1.4. Stop Transfer. The Company
shall issue stop-transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Shares instructing the transfer agent not to register any
transfer of Shares during the Term except in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 1.5. Additional Shares. The
Stockholder hereby agrees that, while this Agreement is in effect, the Stockholder shall promptly notify the Company of any new
Shares acquired (whether upon the exercise of options, conversion of convertible securities, exercise of warrants or by means of
purchase, dividend, distribution or otherwise) by such Stockholder after the date hereof.
 
SECTION 1.6. Disclosure. The Stockholder
hereby authorizes the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in any proxy statement filed with the SEC in connection with
any meeting of stockholders of the Company at which the Proposal is to be considered and all documents and schedules filed with
the SEC in connection with the foregoing, the Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Stockholder’s
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

ARTICLE II.
 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDER
 
The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants
to the Company as of the date hereof and as of the date of any stockholder meeting at which the Proposal is considered, including
any adjournment or postponement thereof (or the date of the taking of any action by written consent with respect to the Proposal)
as follows:
 
SECTION 2.1. Due Authorization, etc.
The Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to take the actions contemplated
hereby (including the granting of the irrevocable proxy pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof), all of which have been duly authorized
by all action necessary on the part of the Stockholder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Stockholder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Stockholder and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws and except that the availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance,
is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding for such remedy may be brought.
 
SECTION 2.2. No Violation. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will (a) require the Stockholder
to file or register with, or obtain any material permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority,
administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other entity, or (b) violate, or cause
a breach of or default under, or conflict with any contract, agreement or understanding, any statute or law, or any judgment, decree,
order, regulation or rule of any governmental agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign
or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration award binding upon the Stockholder, except for such violations, breaches, defaults
or conflicts which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to impair or have an adverse effect on the
Stockholder’s ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement or render inaccurate any of the other representations
made by the Stockholder in this Agreement. No proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined, will have an adverse effect
on the Stockholder’s ability to vote any of the Shares.
 
SECTION 2.3. Ownership of Shares. The
Stockholder has good and marketable title to, and is the sole legal and beneficial owner (determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the “Exchange Act”) of the Shares set forth opposite
its name on Schedule I hereto, in each case free and clear of all liabilities, claims, liens, options, security interests,
proxies, voting trusts, voting agreements, charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or character whatsoever, except
as may be imposed by federal, state or foreign securities laws and this Agreement. The Stockholder has not previously assigned
or sold any of the Shares to any third party. On the date hereof, the Shares set forth opposite the Stockholder’s name on
Schedule I hereto constitute all of the Shares owned of record or beneficially by the Stockholder. The Stockholder
has sole voting power and sole power of disposition with respect to the Shares with no restrictions on its voting rights or rights
of disposition pertaining thereto.
 


 -4-
 

 
SECTION 2.4. Voting Authority. The Stockholder
has full legal power, authority and right to vote all of the Shares owned of record and/or beneficially by the Stockholder in favor
of the Proposal and the approval and authorization of the Transactions without the consent or approval of, or any other action
on the part of, any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder has not entered into any voting
agreement (other than this Agreement) with any Person with respect to any of the Shares, granted any Person any proxy (revocable
or irrevocable) or power of attorney with respect to any of the Shares, deposited any of the Shares in a voting trust or entered
into any arrangement or agreement with any Person limiting or affecting Stockholder’s legal power, authority or right to
vote the Shares on any matter. For purpose hereof, “Person” means any individual, corporation, limited or general
partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, trust, association, joint venture, governmental entity or
any other entity or group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act).
 
SECTION 2.5. Reliance by the Company.
The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that the Company is entering into the Purchase Agreement in reliance upon the Stockholder’s
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of the Stockholder contained herein.

 

ARTICLE III.
 
MISCELLANEOUS
 
SECTION 3.1. Termination. This Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest of (i) immediately following a meeting of the Company’s
stockholders at which the Proposal is voted upon and approved by the Company’s stockholders, which meeting is duly called
and held for such purpose and at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, and (ii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement
at any time prior to the consummation of the Closing contemplated under the Purchase Agreement. No such termination of this Agreement
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.
 
SECTION 3.2. Further Assurances. From
time to time at the request of the Company and without further consideration, the Stockholder will execute and deliver to the Company
such documents and take such action as the Company may reasonably deem to be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions
hereof.
 
SECTION 3.3. No Waiver. The failure
of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, or any custom or practice
of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such
or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.
 


 -5-
 

 
SECTION 3.4. Specific Performance. The
Stockholder acknowledges that the Company will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation
of any of the covenants or agreements of the Stockholder that are contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in
addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Company upon the breach by the Stockholder of such covenants and agreements,
the Company will have the right without the posting of a bond or other security to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach
or threatened breach of such covenants or agreements or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements.
Accordingly, should the Company institute an action or proceeding seeking specific enforcement of the provisions hereof, the Stockholder
hereby waives the claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law and hereby agrees not to assert in any such action
or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.
 
SECTION 3.5. Notice. Any notices, consents,
waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will
be deemed to have been delivered: (a) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (b) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile

or electronically generated and, in the case of an email, a read receipt is received, and in each case kept on file by the sending
party); or (c) upon receipt, when delivered by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed
to the party to receive the same. The addresses and facsimile numbers for such communications shall be:

SECTION 3.6. Capacity. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than
in the Stockholder’s capacity as a record holder and beneficial owner of the Shares.
 
SECTION 3.7. Expenses. Each of the parties
hereto will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement.
 
SECTION 3.8. Headings. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.
 
SECTION 3.9. Severability. If any term
or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that obligations hereunder are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.
 
SECTION 3.10. Entire Agreement. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes any and all other prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
SECTION 3.11. Successors and Assigns.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors,
assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. No assignment or delegation by any party
to this Agreement of any obligations of such party under this Agreement shall operate to relieve or release such party from such
obligations or from any liability hereunder for failure of such obligations to be performed in accordance with their respective
terms.
 
SECTION 3.12. Governing Law; Consent to
Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Delaware for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection
herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement),
and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for
such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such
suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good
and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.
 


 -7-
 

 
SECTION 3.13. Amendment. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Company and the Stockholder. If any material amendment
or waiver is proposed to be made with respect to any other Voting Agreement, the Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Stockholder
shall be afforded the opportunity to enter into or receive (as applicable) a comparable amendment or waiver with respect to this
Agreement.
 
SECTION 3.14. Remedies Not Exclusive.
All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity will
be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party will not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise
of any other such right, power or remedy by such party.
 
SECTION 3.15. Counterparts. This Agreement
may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together,
shall constitute but one instrument, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each party hereto
and delivered to the other parties. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery
of a “.pdf” format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or
on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf”
signature were the original thereof.

Court Of Chancery Explains Categories Of Damages 

					By Edward M.  McNally  on February 16, 2011

Posted In M&A
Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc. v. TVM Life Science Ventures VI, LP,  C.A. 5688-VCS (February 16, 2011) Agreements sometimes try to limit any damages from a misrepresentation or contract breach by excluding consequential or special damages.  This decision notes that is hard to do because what falls into what category of damages is not always clear.  Better to limit damages some other way such as by the amount paid to the seller. The opinion is also noteworthy as an example of the far-reaching scholarship the Court undertook to understand the science involved in the dispute.  Litigants should not underestimate the Court of Chancery in such matters.
