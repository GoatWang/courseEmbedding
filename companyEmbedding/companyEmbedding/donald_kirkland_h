Kirkland Hogue Donald (born September 15, 1953)[1] was a United States Navy Admiral who served as the Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion and Deputy Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration's Naval Reactors. He previously served as Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and Commander, Submarine Allied Command, Atlantic. He retired from his assignment as Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, on November 2, 2012.


EducationEdit
Originally from Norlina, North Carolina, Donald graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science in ocean engineering. He also holds an MBA from the University of Phoenix and is a graduate of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government Senior Executive Fellows Program.

Navy careerEdit
After completing his initial nuclear power and submarine training, he served on the USS Batfish (SSN-681), USS Mariano G. Vallejo (SSBN-658), and USS Seahorse (SSN-669).
Donald was Commanding Officer of the USS Key West (SSN-722), from October 1990 to February 1993. He served as Commander, Submarine Development Squadron Twelve from August 1995 to July 1997. From June 2002 to July 2003, he was assigned as Commander, Submarine Group Eight; Commander, Submarine Force Sixth Fleet (CTF 69); Commander, Submarines Allied Naval Forces South; and Commander, Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarine Force (CTF 164) in Naples, Italy.

Wynne and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley on June 5, 2008, cited the report's findings of a "decline in the Air Force's nuclear mission focus and performance" and a "lack of a critical self-assessment culture" in the Air Force.[5] However, details of Admiral Donald's specific report remain classified.

Donald, the son of a World War II veteran, received an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. Upon graduating, the future admiral began a 37-year career in the Navy, working with nuclear submarines. He served as the commander of the Naval Submarine Forces, and also as deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s naval reactors. He retired last year and joined SPA, where he will now lead the company.   What were some of your strengths early on in the Navy? I give a lot of credit to the leadership of people who were my commanding officers and mentors during my time in the Navy. I had a wonderful set of leaders, particularly on my first ship. I was on the USS Batfish, an attack submarine. We had a dozen or so officers and 130 or so hand-selected enlisted folks. It was a very tight-knit group that worked very, very hard. It was the height of the Cold War. We were deploying all the time, and you never knew where you were going to be next. If anything, the culture and environment around that type of job brings about the most important success factors for people to succeed. You have to be willing to work hard. You have to have the physical and mental stamina to withstand the rigors of getting the job done. It wasn’t like I stood out. It was a team effort. It became the way I understood how to do business.  Talk about some indelible marks mentors made on you? Entering into [Adm. Hyman] Rickover’s program really shaped me. He thought that I could do better than what I was doing. He challenged me to fulfill my potential. I was really impacted by meeting him and seeing his standards for excellence. He was always striving for excellence. If you aren’t getting better, you’re getting behind. You have to be an expert. You have to know your stuff. You have to work at that constantly. There will be bumps in the road. It’s how you respond and deal with them.  What were some of your proudest moments in the Navy? Those instances where you’ve been able to pull together a team and get hard things done, those are the ones that stand out the most. When I had command of the USS Key West, in the eyes of a submariner, that’s a pinnacle of your career. You’re always working to build a team. You’re dealing with constantly changing schedules and transfers of people, in and out. Also, it’s pretty complex technology you’re dealing with. It’s a very harsh environment you’re dealing with. We enjoyed success on that ship. It was the fact that we did it as a team and pulled together through good times, leaving the ship in a better condition than when we found it.  What do you bring to SPA? It’s been a very successful company for a very long time. I do have some different perspectives, having come from where I came from. To the extent that that is helpful, and continuing to satisfy our customers and deal with challenging customers and continue doing work for senior leaders, that’s what I think I can do. I can certainly bring enthusiasm to the job.  Reading any business books? I tend to lean more toward history. The one I’m reading now is because of some work I’m doing for a congressionally appointed panel that I’m on that looks into governance in the nuclear security enterprise. I’m reading “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” by Richard Rhodes. It’s an anthology of all that went into the Manhattan Project. It’s not a business book, but if you look at how you mobilize for such a large undertaking, there are lessons there in organizational leadership.  There’s another book I read called “Six Frigates” by Ian Toll. It’s about how we built the first frigates in the Navy. There’s a lot of lessons in there about how difficult it is to take on large government-sponsored projects. We think we have challenges today in building ships, but if you look back into the late 1700s, it wasn’t all that different.  — Interview with Vanessa Small           business capitalbusiness      false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

SPX Corp.


                  With more than $5 billion in annual revenue, Charlotte, North Carolina-based SPX is a multi-industry manufacturing leader with operations in more than 35 countries and approximately 15,000 associates worldwide.

Meeting the critical needs of world economies – particularly today’s fast-growing emerging markets – has been the driving force behind our strategic expansion and success in recent years. Since 1998, acquisitions and focused organic growth have helped SPX transition from a U.S.-centric automotive component manufacturer with less than $1 billion in sales, to a globally diversified provider of highly engineered, innovative products and technologies that support two critical needs of modern societies: power and energy; and foods and beverages.

SPX solutions play a vital role in global infrastructure expansion to help meet increased demand for electricity, and in helping food and beverage producers increase their capacity to more efficiently deliver greater quantities of safer, higher quality products. Our long-term strategy is focused on serving these two core end markets in emerging, as well as developed countries, through our two largest business segments: Flow Technology and Thermal Equipment and Services.

SPX associates work collaboratively across business segments and borders to deliver greater efficiencies and better ideas for helping our customers succeed and grow their businesses. At SPX, imagination and innovation are as valued as product reliability and profitability. We continuously pursue new and better ways of thinking and working, and collaborating with our customers around the world

                  Today, Brunswick is a market leader in the marine, fitness, and bowling and billiards industries. We have made a commitment to focus our efforts on our core businesses and, as a result, have drawn upon decades of experience to design, build and market world-class recreational products. No company has Brunswick’s breadth and scope in the marine industry. No company rivals Brunswick’s quality and innovation in fitness equipment. And no company possesses Brunswick’s knowledge and heritage in bowling and billiards.

As evidenced by our current portfolio of businesses, we are a different company today than we were 165 years, 25 years or even five years ago, and we have an ambitious road before us. Despite our evolution, two fundamentals remain consistent:

• Our goal to be the best—and all it entails—in any industry in which we participate.
• Our ability to create and unlock value in our varying portfolio of businesses
