For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Dr. Duker received his A.B. degree cum laude from Harvard University in 1980 and his M.D degree magna cum laude from Jefferson Medical College in 1984 where he was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. He completed an internal medicine internship at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston followed by a residency in ophthalmology at the Wills Eye Hospital where he was selected to be Chief Resident. This was followed by a two year medical and surgical fellowship in retinal diseases and intraocular tumors at Wills Eye Hospital.
 Following fellowship, Dr. Duker entered practice with the Schepens Retina Associates in Boston in 1990. In 1992, he was recruited to become the Chief of the Retina Service at the New England Eye Center at Tufts Medical Center. He became acting Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology at Tufts Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine in 2001 and was appointed full time Chairman in 2003, a position he continues to hold.
 Dr. Duker serves as the Director of the New England Eye Center (NEEC), an academic, multi-specialty eye care group with 34 full time ophthalmologists and nearly 200 employees. NEEC has its main office at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA as well as seven satellites offices in Eastern Massachusetts (Mt. Auburn Hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Brookline, Wellesley, Framingham, Watertown, and Leominster). Almost 100,000 patient encounters per year are performed in its facilities and NEEC has annual revenues in excess of $25 million, making it among the largest academic ophthalmology practices in the United States.
 Dr. Duker was the principal founder and a current member of the board of directors of SurgiSite Boston (SSB), an ophthalmology-only, out-patient surgery center in Waltham, MA that opened in 2006. SSB represents a unique joint venture between the Tufts academic ophthalmology department and community ophthalmologists. Together, this unique melding of private and academic practices initiated by Dr. Duker rapidly evolved into the busiest ophthalmic surgery center in Massachusetts on the principle of "quality first". SSB performs over 12,000 intraocular surgeries per year.
 As Chairman of Ophthalmology for Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Duker has the responsibility for managing the hospital's Eye Clinic, the second busiest out-patient service in the hospital. Along with his administrative role with the vision care practice, in his dual role as Chairman of Ophthalmology for Tufts University School of Medicine, he is responsible for the oversight of the academic mission of the department: teaching of medical students, residents, fellows and practicing eye care providers and cultivation of vision research. Since April of 2016, Dr. Duker has been the acting chairman of Dermatology at Tufts Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine.
 With regard to academic achievement, under Dr. Duker’s leadership the Tufts Department of Ophthalmology’s research program has been active and productive, including both bench research vision scientists as well as clinical research specialists. The department and its individual researchers receive generous support from the Foundation for Fighting Blindness (FFB), the Massachusetts Lions Clubs, and the New England Cornea Fund. There are four National Eye Institute (NEI) funded researchers within the department and another ten NEI-supported vision researchers based in other Tufts University departments. An umbrella organization, the Tufts Center of Vision Research (TCVR) ties all these researchers together. Important clinical innovations that have come from the work of NEEC investigators include optical coherence tomography (OCT), intravitreal triamcinolone for diabetic macular edema, topical lidocaine gel for ophthalmic procedures, and the discovery of several unique genes linked to age related macular degeneration.
 His personal research interests include novel imaging techniques of the eye, especially optical coherence tomography (OCT), drug delivery to the posterior segment, retinal vascular disorders and posterior segment uveitis. Over the past two decades, he has been instrumental in discovering clinical applications of OCT technology. He was one of the first to investigate the use of a long-acting ganciclovir implant for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. He has served as principle investigator or co-investigator in two dozen industry-sponsored and NEI-sponsored multi-centered trials.
Dr. Duker has over 250 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. His manuscripts have appeared in high impact journals and one of them has been among the top 10 referenced ophthalmology research papers over the past five years. As a result, he is currently recognized as the sixth most influential author in ophthalmology in the world by Microsoft's Academic Search (http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=6&SubDomain=18&entitytype=2) 
 He serves on the editorial boards of three journals: OSLI Retina, Retina Cases and Brief Reports, and Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences.  He has served as a reviewer for a myriad of journals including the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, and Retina. He is the co-editor-in-chief of a  journal dedicated solely to the field of retina: International Journal of Retina and Vitreous (IJRV). He served as an examiner for the American Board of Ophthalmology from 1999 to 2005.
 Dr. Duker has received many awards including the Heed Ophthalmic Foundation Fellowship, the Honor Award, the Senior Honor Award, and the Life Achievement Honor Award from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), and the Honor Award from the American Society of Retinal Specialists (ASRS). He has been named one of the best doctors in Boston by Boston Magazine for 8 years in a row. Castle Connolly recognizes him as one of the top doctors in the United States and US News and World report rank him among the top 100 ophthalmologists in the United States.
 Dr. Duker’s commitment to medical education includes direct involvement in the publishing of a number of textbooks. He serves as a lead editor for Yanoff and Duker’s Ophthalmology, which is currently in its fourth edition.  This award-winning textbook has been one of the best-selling titles in visual sciences over the past decade. In addition, Dr. Duker has written or edited many other books including A Handbook of OCT, Optical Coherence Tomography (3rd edition), Rapid Diagnosis in Ophthalmology, the Atlas of Ophthalmic Surgery (2nd edition), Current Management of Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology and A Handbook of Retinal Diseases. Along with his work as a writer and editor of textbooks, he has authored 27 individual textbook chapters. He serves on Elseveir’s Clinical Key editorial board.
 Under his direction as chairman, 68 ophthalmology residents have been trained and are currently in practice all across the United States. Additionally another 104 fellows in ophthalmology have been graduated during his leadership span, including 34 surgical retina fellows and 13 medical retinal fellows.
 Dr. Duker has been active in professional organizations including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Society of Retina Specialists, The New England Ophthalmology Society, The International Society of Sports Vision, The Massachusetts Society of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, the Society of Heed Fellows, The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.
He has served as board member of the Massachusetts Society of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, Baystate Health Care, the Boston Aid to the Blind, Tufts Medical Center and the Tufts Medical Center Physicians Organization.
 Dr. Duker has given hundreds of lectures locally, regionally, and nationally. In addition, he is a widely sought-after speaker for international meetings. Over his career he has delivered lectures in Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, England, Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Ghana. He has been an invited Grand Rounds speaker at 12 institutions and has delivered two named lectures.
Since 1993, Dr. Duker has helped to organize, plan and moderate the Hawaiian Eye Retina Meeting, one of the largest non-society sponsored retina meetings in the world.
In 2015, Dr. Duker was appointed a Director of Eleven Biotherapeutics, a publically-traded clinical stage biotech company that is developing targeting protein therapeutics against cancer. He is also a Director of pSivida, a publically traded company that develops long term drug release platforms for the eye.
He has served or currently serves as a consultant for many companies including Aura Biosciences, Astra Zeneca, Ophthotech, EyeNetra, Genentech/Roche, Alcon/Novartis, CoDa, Merck, EMD/Serono, QLT Pharmaceuticals, Nicox, Omeros, Optos, Panoptica, Santen, Constellation Therapeutics, Thrombogenics, Topcon, OptoVue, Carl Zeiss Meditech, Regeneron, JP Morgan, Cowan and Associates, Gerson Lehman Group, Third Rock Ventures, and McKinsey Consultants.
Along with being the founder of a highly successful ophthalmic ambulatory surgery center, Dr. Duker is founder and currently involved in three other start-up companies:  Hemera Biosciences, a clinical-stage biotech company developing treatments of eye disease through complement inhibition using a gene therapy delivery system, Scalable Diagnostics which is building a device to perform automated diabetic retinopathy screening, and the Boston Image Reading Center (BIRC).
Recognizing the importance of international ophthalmology opportunities for young ophthalmologists, he has made it possible for the ophthalmology residents and retina fellows at Tufts Medical Center to volunteer for medical missions in El Salvador, Chile, Thailand, and Ghana. In addition, he personally spent time in Ghana in June of 2013 teaching retina procedures to local ophthalmologists under the auspices of the Unite for Sight organization.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREAnti Vegf Use In Ophthalmologyby Duker, Jay S., M.D. (Edt)/ Liang, Michelle C., M.D. (Edt)"The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents has revolutionized therapy for a host of ocular diseases associated with leakage from normal blood vessels and pathologic blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology is anall-inclusive reference designed to provide detailed, up-to-date, and clinically relevant information on the current use of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of all ocular conditions. Drs. Jay S. Duker and Michelle C. Liang have assembled a prestigious group of contributors who pool their collective expertise in this comprehensive book. Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology is split into two sections with the first providing the history of VEGF and an overview of anti-VEGF agents and different routes of drug delivery, as it is important for eye care providers to be familiar with up-to-date aspects of the medications and indications for use. The second section details the clinical uses of anti-VEGF agents in numerous ocular diseases, from the anterior segment including cornea and glaucoma to uveitis and various retinal and choroidal diseases. Each chapter in this section summarizes the disease process and utilizes high-quality ocular imaging to demonstrate the therapeutic use of the anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology combines the theory and applications of anti-VEGF agents, making it not only a great learning tool for beginners but also a useful reference tool for a wide range of eye care professionals including optometrists, residents, comprehensive ophthalmologists, as well as specialists in anterior segment, pediatrics, and vitreoretinal disease"--Provided by publisher.OphthalmologyCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

– USA, MA – pSivida Corp. (NASDAQ:PSDV) (ASX:PVA), a leader in the development of sustained release drug delivery products for treating eye diseases, today announced the appointment of Jay S. Duker, M.D, to the Company’s Board of Directors. Dr. Duker is the Director of the New England Eye Center and Professor and Chairman of Ophthalmology at the Tufts Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“Dr. Jay Duker is a recognized international expert in the treatment of diseases of the back of the eye,” said David J. Mazzo, Ph.D., Chairman of pSivida’s Board of Directors. “Dr. Duker’s unique combination of academic, research and clinical experience with ophthalmic disease will be a significant asset to pSivida. His contributions will be invaluable and I, along with the other Directors, look forward to working with him to advance our Company to the next level of success.”
As chairman of ophthalmology for Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Duker is responsible for managing the hospital’s clinical ophthalmology practice. His role as chairman of ophthalmology for Tufts University School of Medicine encompasses leading the academic mission of the school, educating medical students, residents, fellows and practicing eye-care providers in ophthalmology and conducting ophthalmic research. As the Director of the New England Eye Center, he leads an academic, multi-specialty eye care group with 35 ophthalmologists and nearly 200 employees.
“Dr. Duker’s well-earned reputation among the ophthalmologist community combined with his scientific experience in eye diseases and corporate success bring a unique blend of science and business acumen to the pSivida board,” commented Nancy Lurker, President and Chief Executive Officer. “His addition further strengthens the Board’s capabilities and I’m excited to work alongside him to execute our business plan.”
In his clinical practice, Dr. Duker treats diseases of the posterior segment of the eye including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, posterior segment uveitis and retinal vascular diseases as well as rare retinal disorders. His principal research interests include retinal vascular disease, drug delivery to the eye, posterior uveitis and novel imaging techniques for the posterior segment. He has published nearly 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and authored four books on ophthalmology including a best-selling textbook. Dr. Duker serves on the editorial board of three ophthalmic journals. He is a graduate of Harvard University and Jefferson Medical College.
Dr. Duker is also a director of Eleven Biotherapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing protein therapeutics to treat diseases of the eye, and a co-founder and Director of Hemera Biosciences, a privately held company seeking to develop anti-complement gene based therapies for the treatment of dry and wet age related macular degeneration.
About pSivida Corp. pSivida Corp. headquartered in Watertown, MA, is a leader in the development of sustained release, drug delivery products for treating eye diseases. pSivida has developed three of only four FDA-approved sustained-release treatments for back-of-the-eye diseases. The most recent, ILUVIEN, a micro-insert for diabetic macular edema, licensed to Alimera Sciences, is currently sold in the U.S. and three EU countries. Retisert, an implant for posterior uveitis, is licensed to and sold by Bausch & Lomb. pSivida’s lead product candidate, Medidur, a micro-insert for posterior uveitis being independently developed, is currently in pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. pSivida’s pre-clinical development program is focused on using its core platform technologies Durasert and Tethadur to deliver drugs and biologics to treat wet and dry age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases.

Description:
The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents has revolutionized therapy for a host of ocular diseases associated with leakage from normal blood vessels and pathologic blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology is an all-inclusive reference designed to provide detailed, up-to-date, and clinically relevant information on the current use of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of all ocular conditions.
 Drs. Jay S. Duker and Michelle C. Liang have assembled a prestigious group of contributors who pool their collective expertise in this comprehensive book. Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology is split into two sections with the first providing the history of VEGF and an overview of anti-VEGF agents and different routes of drug delivery, as it is important for eye care providers to be familiar with up-to-date aspects of the medications and indications for use.
 The second section details the clinical uses of anti-VEGF agents in numerous ocular diseases, from the anterior segment including cornea and glaucoma to uveitis and various retinal and choroidal diseases. Each chapter in this section summarizes the disease process and utilizes high-quality ocular imaging to demonstrate the therapeutic use of the anti-VEGF agents.
 Some of the topics covered in Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology:

Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
Retinal Vein Occlusion
Uveitis
Neovascular Glaucoma
Macular Edema
Retinopathy of Prematurity
Corneal Disease

Anti-VEGF Use in Ophthalmology combines the theory and applications of anti-VEGF agents, making it not only a great learning tool for beginners but also a useful reference tool for a wide range of eye care professionals including optometrists, residents, comprehensive ophthalmologists, as well as specialists in anterior segment, pediatrics, and vitreoretinal disease.
