The NO THANKS list is a robust list of ingredients that you will never find in Healthiest Approved Products. We’ve done the research for you and vetted thousands of products to ensure they are the healthiest for you and your family.
Time to say NO THANKS to these ingredients:
1,4-dioxane: a contaminant created when common ingredients are mixed together and react and is therefore not found on ingredient labels. It is considered a probable human carcinogen, toxic to organs and the respiratory system, and a skin irritant. Likely to be present where ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, PEGs, ceteareth, xynol, and oleth are listed on ingredient labels. Found in products that create suds: shampoo, body wash, bubble bath.
Acetone: a powerful solvent most commonly used to remove nail polish. It can cause skin, eye, and lung irritation and non-reproductive organ system toxicity. Persistent use can result in endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity.
Aluminum: Often used in antiperspirant and aluminum powder (finely ground particles of aluminum are used as a colorant in some make-ups). May lead to non-reproductive organ system toxicity.

Artificial Coloring (FD&C Red 27, FD&C blue, FD&CBlue 1, FD&CBlue 2, FD&CRed 40, FD&CYellow 5, FD&C, Yellow 6): Pigments from animal, plant, and synthetic sources used to color foods, cosmetics, and other products. Cochineal is from insects. Widely used FD&C and D&C colors are coaltar (bituminous coal) derivatives that are continuously tested on animals due to their carcinogenic properties. Alternatives: grapes, beets, turmeric, saffron, carrots, chlorophyll, annatto, alkanet.
Artificial Sweeteners (sucralose, aspartame, saccharine, acesulfame): Used as a sugar substitute and found in a variety of foods and beverages. They are just as bad as sugar and can cause diabetes and obesity.

Avobenzone: According to the Global Healing Center, “avobenzone degrades in the sun, resulting in the release of free radicals that may actually increase the risk for cancer.”
Benzalkonium chloride: A disinfectant used as a preservative and surfactant that is associated with severe skin, eye, and respiratory irritation and allergies. Found in sunscreens and moisturizers.
Benzoate (Sodium benzoate, Benzoic acid): A synthetic chemical and preservative commonly used in foods (fruit juices, sodas, salad dressings), pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. A small percentage of people are hypersensitive to sodium benzoate and can experience asthmatic attacks, hives, or other allergic reactions when they consume the preservative. A more common problem, however, is the combination of sodium benzoate and citric acid and/or ascorbic acid (vitamin C). When these ingredients combine, they form benzene, a cancer-causing chemical associated with leukemia and other blood cancers.  
Benzophenone: Often used in nail polish and sunscreen as a fragrance ingredient and to absorb UV light. It’s a possible human carcinogen and hormone disruptor.
BPA (Bisphenol A): Found in plastic bottles, plastic bottles, lining of aluminum food cans, possibly in eyeshadow and styling gel. May be a hormone disruptor that may also alter DNA.
Butoxyethanol: A solvent used to control viscosity or a “fragrance” additive. It irritates skin and may cause cancer and reproductive toxicity. Found in fragrance and synthetic hair color.
BHA BUTYLATED HYDROXYANISOLE BHT (BUTYLATED HYDROXYTOLUENE): Synthetic antioxidants that are used to extend shelf life. They are likely carcinogens and hormone disruptors and may cause liver damage. Found in chewing gum, lipsticks, moisturizers, diaper creams, and other cosmetics.
Chlorine: Chlorine dioxide is used as a drinking water disinfection agent and as a bleaching agent for cellulose, paper pulp, flour and oils. In water, it rapidly decomposes into the toxic disinfection byproducts chlorite and chlorate.
Chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs): One of the primary sources of global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer. This ozone layer depletion allows more UV rays into earth which can cause skin cancer. CFCs were originally developed as refrigerants during the 1930s. Some of these compounds, especially trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), are found in aerosol-spray propellants, solvents, and foam-blowing agents.
Corn maltodextrin: Often labeled as natural since it’s derived from plants, but it's highly processed food additive which can affect your blood sugar and gut bacteria. It is used as a filler or sweetener for powdered drinks, sports drinks, sauces, canned fruits, instant puddings, and gelatins.
CYCLOPENTASILOXANE (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane or DH4 DH5): A lubricant solvent often used in hair products and cream deodorants. It is known to be an endocrine (hormone) disruptor and may impair human fertility.
Doxylamine Succinate: An antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. This medication works by blocking certain natural substances (histamine, acetylcholine) that your body makes. It causes dry mouth, ataxia, urinary retention, drowsiness, memory problems, inability to concentrate, hallucinations, psychosis, and a marked increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Studies have shown it to cause both liver and thyroid cancer in mice. Found in Zyrtec, Benadryl, and sleep aides.
Ethanolamines (MEA/DEA/TEA): Surfactants and pH adjusters linked to allergies, skin toxicity, hormone disruption, and inhibited fetal brain development. It is found in hair dyes, mascara, foundation, fragrances, sunscreens, dry cleaning solvents, paint, and pharmaceuticals.

Ethoxycinnmate: A chemical widely used in sunscreens and skin care products with SPF. It is a potential endocrine disruptor and studies in cells suggest it may impact hormones. It may also enhance the absorption of pesticides in the body.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA): A chelating (binding) agent that is added to cosmetics to improve stability. May be toxic to organs. It is found in synthetic hair color and moisturizers.
Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives:  Antimicrobial preservatives that work by forming formaldehyde in cosmetic products. The formaldehyde releasing preservatives can be absorbed through the skin and have been linked to cancer, allergic skin reactions, asthma, neurotoxicity, and developmental toxicity., Present where quaternium-15, DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, Diazolidinyl urea, Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3 diol [Bromopol] and several other preservatives are listed. Found in shampoo, body wash, and bubble bath.
Glycol Ethers: Solvents used as an ingredient in cleaning compounds, liquid soaps, and cosmetics. Exposure to high levels of the glycol ethers in humans results in narcosis, pulmonary edema, and severe liver and kidney damage.
GMOs: A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i.e., a genetically engineered organism). GMOs are the source of medicines and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and to produce other goods.

Homosalate: A chemical widely used in sunscreens and skin care products with SPF. It is a potential endocrine disruptor and studies in cells suggest it may impact hormones. It may also enhance the absorption of pesticides in the body.
Hydroquinone: A skin lightening chemical that inhibits the production of melanin and is  linked to cancer, organ toxicity, and skin irritation. Found in skin lightening creams.
Lead: Exposure to small amounts of lead over a long period of time is called chronic toxicity. Lead is particularly dangerous because once it gets into a person's system, it is distributed throughout the body just like helpful minerals such as iron, calcium, and zinc. Found in paints and some lipsticks. 
Lilial (BUTYLPHENYL METHYLPROPIONAL): Lilial (butylphenyl methyl propanal) is a synthetic scent ingredient and is associated with allergies and contact dermatitis. Found in beauty products including perfumes, shampoos, deodorants, tanning lotions, and hair styling products.
Mercury (Thimerosal): Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative use in ear and eye drops and mascara.
Methyl cellosolve: A fragrance ingredient and solvent that is an irritant and a possible neurotoxin, developmental toxin, and cause of DNA mutations that could lead to cancer. Found in anti-aging creams.
Methylisothiazolinone and methylchloroisothiazolinone: Chemical preservatives that are among the most common irritants, sensitizers, and causes of contact skin allergies. Found in shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.
Methylparaben: Member of the paraben family of preservatives used by the food, pharmaceutical, and personal care product industries. Parabens mimic estrogen and can act as potential hormone (endocrine) system disruptors.
Mineral Oils (liquid paraffin, liquid petrolatum, paraffin oil) - Mineral oil is a colorless and odorless oil that's made from petroleum—as a by-product of the distillation of petroleum to produce gasoline. Mineral oil is considered “comedogenic,” which means it can clog your pores and increase the risk of acne and blackheads. It's long been used as a common ingredient in lotions, creams, ointments, and cosmetics.
Monosodium glutamate (MSG, also known as sodium glutamate, autolyzed yeast extract, Torula yeast ): A flavor enhancer commonly added to Chinese food, canned vegetables, soups, and processed meats. It's also one of the worst food additives on the market. It over stimulates the nervous system and can cause a variety of symptoms like burning sensations of the mouth, head and neck, weakness of the arms or legs, headaches, upset stomach, hives or other allergic-type reactions with the skin.
Oxybenzone: Sunscreen agent and ultraviolet light absorber linked to irritation, sensitization, and allergies, and possible hormone disruption. Found in sunscreen and moisturizer.
Parabens (methyl-, isobutyl-, propyl- and others): A class of preservatives commonly used to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold. Parabens are endocrine (or hormone) disruptors, which alter important hormone mechanisms in our bodies. Parabens mimic estrogen. They can lock on to our cell’s own estrogen receptors and mess with important natural signals. They may play a role in triggering breast cancer. Found in shampoo, face cleanser, body wash, body lotion, foundation.
Peg 40: Hydrogenated Castor Oil is the polyethylene glycol derivatives of hydrogenated castor oil. It is an amber colored, slightly viscous liquid that has a naturally mildly fatty odor. It is used in cosmetics and beauty products as an emulsifier, surfactant, and fragrance ingredient, according to research. Organ system toxicity and contamination are of concern.
PEGS (polyethylene glycols): Petroleum-based compounds that are widely used in cosmetics as thickeners, solvents, softeners, and moisture-carriers. Depending on the manufacturing process they may contain measurable amounts of ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxan which are know as human carcinogens.
Perchlorate: A colorless, odorless chemical most commonly found in rocket fuel that can damage thyroid function. It is also used to make other commercial items such as matches, dyes, pool chemicals, and fertilizers. You’re most likely to be exposed by ingesting food from contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water, breathing contaminated dust.
Petroleum: Petrolatum, or petroleum jelly, is often used in personal care products as a moisturizing agent. Properly refined petrolatum has no known health concerns, but often it is not fully refined in the US, which means it can be contaminated with toxic chemicals called PAHs. White Petrolatum is refined and safe for use.
Phenoxyethanol: A preservative used in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions.
Phthalates (DBP, DEHP, DEP and others): A class of plasticizing chemicals used to make products more pliable or to make fragrances stick to skin. Phthalates disrupt the endocrine system and may cause birth defects. Found in synthetic fragrance, nail polish, and hairspray.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): An odorless and solid plastic. PVC contains high levels of chlorine and dioxins are released during the manufacturing, burning, or landfilling of the plastic. Exposure to PVC often includes exposure to phthalates, which are used to soften PVC and may have adverse health effects. Dioxins and phthalates are suspected to be endocrine disruptors.
Resorcinol: A colorant and fragrance ingredient that is a skin irritant, toxic to the immune system and organs, and suspected to cause hormone disruption. Found in hair color.
Retinyl palmitate and Retinol (Vitamin A): A nutrient that may damage DNA and speed the growth of skin tumors when used topically. Found in moisturizer and anti-aging skincare.
Sodium Lauryl sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES): SLS and SLES are surfactants that can cause skin irritation or trigger allergies. SLES is often contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a byproduct of a petrochemical process called ethoxylation which is used to process other chemicals in order to make them less harsh. Found in shampoo, body wash, and bubble bath.
Sodium nitrite: A preservative that fights harmful bacteria in processed and cured meats. Under certain conditions in the human body, nitrite can damage cells and change into molecules that cause cancer.
Benzophenone: A fragrance ingredient and prevents UV light from damaging scents and colors in products like soaps and perfumes. It can also be added to plastic packaging as a UV blocker. Benzophenone and its derivatives (oxybenzone) are linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, and organ system toxicity.
PABA: Commonly used in sunscreens as UVB filters. Can alter thyroid activity and its derivatives may have other endocrine disrupting properties.
Synthetic flavor or fragrance: A engineered scent or flavoring agent that may contain any combination of 3,000+ stock chemical ingredients, including hormone disruptors and allergens. Fragrance formulas are protected under federal law's classification of trade secrets, and therefore can remain undisclosed. Can be found in all types of cosmetics.
Triclosan and Triclocarban: Antimicrobial pesticides that are toxic to the aquatic environment and may also impact human reproductive systems. Found in liquid soap, soap bars, and toothpaste.

Toluene: A volatile petrochemical solvent that is toxic to the immune system and can cause birth defects. Found in nail polish.
Healthiest will never give a product the "Healthiest Stamp of Approval" to any products containing these ingredients.

ABOUT HEMP HEALTH INC.










About Us


Hemp Health Mission Statement
Our mission is to lead the industry in bringing hemp cannabidiol (CBD) based products to the marketplace. We are passionate about the incredible health benefits derived from the hemp plant, and with recent advances in separating the most medically active (and non-psychoactive) component of hemp, there has never been a better time to bring this miracle product to the world. We strive to educate the world on the benefits of hemp CBD and lead the way in the health industry.


Who is Hemp Health Inc?
Hemp Health is your best source for quality, affordable health and wellness products made from CBD-rich hemp. Based in Carlsbad, California, we at Hemp Health are dedicated to providing you with the highest quality, most affordable hemp CBD products on the market.
Our hemp CBD products are legal in all 50 states and are used in foods and as nutritional additives. These products can be consumed in the form of pill capsules, powder, topical salves, oral sprays, and even edibles like peanut butter. We also offer hemp CBD products and treats for your pets!
When you buy hemp CBD oil from us, you know you’re getting products you can trust. No one makes CBD rich hemp oil products like us. Pharma Hemp CBD is non-GMO and contain no pesticides, solvents, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers. We have all our products tested by third-party laboratories so you can buy CBD hemp oil that is completely safe and legal for consumption. There’s no questions where to buy hemp CBD oil from—the answer is Hemp Health.










What’s in Hemp Health’s CBD Oil?
What makes our products great? CBD or cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp. Although hemp is part of the cannabis family, we offer hemp CBD oil for sale that contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive properties commonly associated with cannabis. This means you can buy hemp CBD oil from us and trust that you are getting completely legal products.
At Hemp Health, we offer you ultra-concentrated hemp CBD that is grown and harvested in select microclimates on generational farms in hemp-friendly countries. Once harvested, our hemp is carefully processed and undergoes extraction and quality testing, creating legal CBD-rich hemp oil which we infuse into each and every Hemp Health product. This ensures that all our products have the desired hemp CBD oil effects while satisfying federal laws and guidelines for production and distribution.
Why Buy Hemp CBD Oil from Hemp Health?
We offer high quality products you can trust. We offer one of the most quality yet most affordable high CBD hemp oil products on the market today. We provide you with the most natural product, and it shows in our hemp CBD oil reviews. Check them out on our hemp CBD products page!
We strive to make our products the best. We offer third party lab test results to validate the superiority of our products. Whether you’re ordering hemp CBD oil wholesale, for yourself, or even your pet, you know you’re getting trustworthy products with Hemp Health.
We offer a convenient and simple ordering experience. Our products are legal in all 50 states. No need to buy hemp CBD in Colorado when you can buy hemp CBD oil online from Hemp Health! It’s the safe and easy solution to get what you need.
We provide you with a personal, quality experience. Our outstanding customer service is dedicated to meeting your needs. Contact us or call 877-598-9984 and see why we stand out from the rest.

Anti-aging 


The quest for everlasting youth: Nicolas Flamel's Elixir of Life, Ponce De Leon and his fabled Fountain of Youth, the Greeks' ambrosia, and Cleopatra's milk and honey baths. The search for eternal youth seems to be a normal part of the human experience. 
Maybe the Fountain of Youth is not a fountain at all, but instead is a nutrient-dense superfood, a single-celled algae, a root vegetable from the Peruvian Andes, or a fruit grown high in the rainforest canopy of Brazil. Various herbs, roots, fruits, berries, and vegetables have been revered through the ages for their reported anti-aging properties.
Traditional Chinese Medicine classified 100 herbs as Superior Tonic Herbs to promote longevity. Among these are He Shou Wu, Ginseng, and Schizandra. In Ayruvedic Medicine practices Shatavari, Amla berry, and Ashwagandha, are considered Rasayana herbs- promoting overall health, vitality, and longevity. 
Today, antioxidants are thought to protect cells from the effects of free radical damage, strengthen the body's ability to fight sickness and disease, and cosmetics manufacturers include them in formulas to combat premature signs of aging. Is this the secret to youth? Only time will tell!

Blood Sugar Support


Blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, is the main source of energy in the body. After you eat, sugars and starches are broken down by the body into glucose. A hormone called insulin is produced in the pancreas and helps glucose travel throughout the body and into cells to be used as energy. 
Blood sugar levels that are too high or too low can leadto hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia. If the body does not produce enough of the insulin hormone, then Diabetes Type 1 (juvenile diabetes) can occur. If the insulin is not used properly in the body, then Diabetes Type 2 can occur. Pregnancy can effect blood glucose levels and lead to Gestational Diabetes. 
Vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin D, Zinc, Chromium, B-complex vitamins, and Magnesium may support healthy blood sugar levels. Herbal supplements such as ginseng, grape seed, and fenugreek are often used in traditional herbal remedies to support blood sugar levels. In traditional Chinese medicine, Gynostemma is used to control blood sugar levels. An Ayurvedic herb used to support blood sugar is Gymnema Sylvestre, and the name of this ancient herb literally means "Sugar Destroyer".

Sunbiotics  




Don't just take your probiotics- snack them! Sunbiotics brings you a line of snack foods enhanced with beneficial probiotics. From a decadent probiotic chocolate bar to mouthwatering raw, organic almonds in a variety of scrumptious flavors; Sunbiotics snacks are nutritious and delicious. 
Sunbiotics is a delectable way to take your probiotics each day. Beneficial microorganisms, or probiotics, play an essential role in regulating our intestine's lymphatic tissue for a healthy and robust immune system. These healthy microorganisms in our digestive systems vastly aid in our absorption of calories and nutrients, preventing us from becoming severely malnourished; they break down nutrients and then carry them into our blood stream. Probiotics also produce essential vitamins that we then absorb, such as vitamin K, biotin, folic acid, and vitamin B12.  
Sunbiotics raw, certified organic, non-dairy, gluten-free snacks are the perfect nutritious treat for any occasion.

Body Ecology  




After years of extensive study, Body Ecology founder Donna Gates created a back-to-basics approach to restoring health and vitality by understanding the invaluable balance of the human body's "inner ecology".
Often forgotten or unconsidered, probiotics and enzymes are crucial to a healthy and efficient internal system. When this system is out of balance, a host of medical issues and conditions can arise. Body Ecology's products are all designed to help cultivate, nourish, cleanse and repair the body's abundant inner ecosystem via products such as Body Ecology Kefir Starter, Coco-Biotic, Potent Proteins, Vitality SuperGreens, and more.
Much more than a "diet", Body Ecology offers a constantly expanding body of knowledge that focuses on the benefits of establishing and maintaining an inner ecosystem. Eating fermented foods and following the BED principles lays down a foundation for health that is essential to wellness.

BodyBio  




In 1995, Ed and Patricia Kane, Ph.D. began to develop a medical software
program that would produce a list of required nutrients based on an
individual’s blood chemistry results. Dr. Kane created the database,
which links nutritional deficiencies to a person’s blood chemistry/CBC
and red cell fatty acids, and provides recommendations to correct those
deficiencies (The BodyBio Report). 
The product took the form of a service to doctors providing them with an
evidence-based means of nutritional supplementation. The BodyBio Report is
based on the research of Dr. Patricia Kane and her unique background of over
thirty years of clinical research, practicums with individual leaders in
metabolic intervention, as well as her experience in private practice in the
field of nutritional biochemistry. BodyBio has used this pioneering research to
provide nutritional diagnostic reports to healthcare practitioners around the
world. These unique, in-depth reports bring into focus those nutrients that a
patient’s body may require, based upon documented research and the
patients’ individual blood test results. The BodyBio report has proven
invaluable in assisting healthcare practitioners and researchers worldwide in
providing medical care guidance as well as preventative care options for their
patients.
