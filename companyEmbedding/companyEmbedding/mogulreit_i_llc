MogulREIT I FAQs

What is MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. MogulREIT I intends to qualify as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2016.

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT?

MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.

Who can invest in MogulREIT? 

MogulREIT is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors must have net worth and annual income greater than $10,000. 

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT?

The minimum investment is $1,000.

Can I invest in MogulREIT I using a SDIRA (Self-Directed IRA) or other type of retirement account?

Yes. We have added the ability to take retirement funds into MogulREIT I. This means you can use your SDIRA to make investments.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT?

In the first quarter of 2017 we updated our Redemption Plan (now referred to as the Share Repurchase Program) to allow for a higher repurchase rate, faster. Share Repurchases from MogulREIT I are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the share repurchase rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT is different since investment decisions are made by our Manager and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

RealtyMogul.com has a highly experienced team of real estate finance professionals, led by Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at RealtyMogul.com have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. The Company benefits from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles. Learn more.
The credit team of RealtyMogul.com is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. RealtyMogul.com’s Chief Credit Officer, Megan Goodfellow, has been involved in institutional finance for three decades, specializing in the analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies.  Ms. Goodfellow has assembled a strong team of credit and underwriting professionals whose expertise has been honed in the service of RealtyMogul.com, and which will be brought to bear for MogulREIT’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on our investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If the fund chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the fund, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Realty Mogul Review – Real Estate Investing through Crowdfunding










Review of: Realty Mogul
Reviewed by: Kevin Mercadante
Published on: July 26, 2017
Last Modified: July 26, 2017







Editor Rating
Rated 3.5 stars












Realty Mogul offers a unique opportunity to invest in real estate that’s less involved than buying a property outright on an individual basis but is much deeper in scope than investing in real estate through a real estate investment trust (REIT). It’s an opportunity to invest in real estate through a variety of close-to-home investment opportunities.
 


Just as crowdfunding has come to investing and borrowing, it has also made its way to real estate investing. Realty Mogul is a real estate crowdfunding platform where investors and real estate investment sponsors and borrowers come together to create mutually agreeable real estate investments. Although we found a few flaws in the system, overall it is easy to use and convenient. Here’s our full review.

What is Realty Mogul?
Realty Mogul is an online real estate capital marketplace that began in 2013. The platform was founded by Jilliene Helman and Justin Hughes. Their aim was to disrupt traditional real estate funding by developing an online crowd funding site.
Crowdfunding is the process of bringing together investors, borrowers and investment sponsors to create new investments. In this way it’s considered a “peer-to-peer” arrangement, involving primarily individuals on both sides of the transaction (though Realty Mogul is also open to institutional participation).
Today, the platform claims more than 120,000 investors, borrowers and sponsors. It has provided financing for more than 350 properties, with loans totaling more than $270 million. The platform arranges residential debt products, as well as both equity and debt products for commercial real estate. Realty Mogul is staffed by a team of professionals who have a mix of experience in real estate, finance and technology.

Realty Mogul Features



Minimum Investment
$5,000 ($2,500 for REITs)


Fees
0.30% – 0.50%/year


Accredited Investor
No


REITs
Yes


Offering Types
Debt, Equity, Preferred Equity


Property Types
Commercial



Features and Pricing
To invest with Realty Mogul, you must make a minimum initial investment of $5,000. You can make standard ACH transfers from your bank account for amounts up to $100,000. For amounts that exceed $100,000, you’ll need to use wire transfers. Each investment that you fund will have a specific account number that the platform will use to make sure that the funds go directly into that particular investment opportunity.
Signup process. You start by creating an account. You must first create a password and have your email address confirmed. Then you must certify that you’re an accredited investor, which is to say that you are a sophisticated investor with substantial financial strength, well able to withstand a potential loss on your investment position. After that, you will enter general information, and you’re in.
Realty Mogul Dashboard. The dashboard enables investors to track all of the terms of their investment on the platform. This includes how much money they have invested, active transactions and earnings on those investments.


How Does Realty Mogul Work?
Realty Mogul enables investors to participate in a wide range of real estate investments. Some examples include multi-family dwellings, office buildings, industrial sites, self-storage, retail, medical buildings and hospitality establishments. They will even enable you to participate in single-family properties that are bought for the purpose of being rehabilitated and flipped. Just about any property can be invested in, as long as it is not used as a primary home or as a secondary residence.
When you invest, you typically do so by purchasing shares in a Realty Mogul limited liability company (LLC) that in turn invests into an LLC or Limited Partnership (LP) that holds title to the real property. Investing in this way minimizes overhead for the investment sponsors and provides access to more investment opportunities, as well as streamlined reporting of distributions through the platform.
RM Manager, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Realty Mogul, serves as manager of the Realty Mogul LLCs.
The term of specific investments depends upon whether it is a debt or equity investment. Loan investments are generally six to 12 months, while equity investments are anywhere from three years up to 10 years. Equity investments generally pay distributions on a quarterly basis, while debt investments pay monthly. These are just general rules, and it’s important to understand the distributions on any investment are never guaranteed.

Invest in Commercial Real Estate with Realty Mogul
For income tax purposes, an IRS form K-1 will be provided for each equity investment, reporting the results of that particular investment. Income from loans will be reported on IRS form 1099.
Debt investments. When investing in loans, you will purchase either an entire loan — which is actually secured by real estate — or what is known as a platform note. These notes are borrower payment-dependent promissory notes from Realty Mogul. They are unsecured, limited-recourse loans that correspond with the underlying mortgage loan originated on the website.
If you choose to be the sole investor on a whole loan, you will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default.
Realty Mogul benefits:

Ease of investment selection
Quick and easy funding
24/7 investment monitoring
Documents can be executed online
Quarterly or monthly distributions
Realty Mogul provides more investment flexibility than real estate investment trusts (REITs)

Investments typically do not require capital calls, which are requests for additional capital beyond the initial investment

Individual investments are “pre-vetted,” which means the platform provides an initial underwriting to determine the viability of each investment

Invest in both loans and equity investments

MogulREIT I (New)
In competing with Fundrise’s eREITs Realty Mogul has introduced a REIT themselves. Called MogulREIT I, the benefits of a REIT is no accreditation is needed, more diversification at a lower amount needed than investing in individual properties, and typically lower investment requirement than a private placement. Though non-accredited investors must have a net worth and an annual income greater than $25,000. The minimum amount to invest is $2,500 and the REIT will have an annual fee capped at 3% which makes this fund costly and no bargain. 
According to their website “MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.” So it will be a pool of various property types and not just one section or location around the country.
Unlike other private REITs that have long investment periods without redemptions, Realty Mogul states it will allow redemptions on a quarterly basis. But also noted in the offering circular, there are limits on the total amount of redemptions per year.


 Pros

 "Pre-Vetted" Investments — Realty Mogul has a preliminary underwriting process that evaluates the property, location and the borrower or sponsor for each investment opportunity available on the platform. The vetting extends to background and criminal checks on the principles involved in the investments.
Simple Investment Process — When purchased individually, real estate investments can be quite complicated, especially commercial properties and properties purchased that are rehabbed and flipped. But Realty Mogul makes real estate investing almost as simple as investing in paper assets, the way you would on an investment brokerage platform.
No Capital Calls — Other than for foreclosure costs on whole loans (but not platform notes), there are no capital calls in which you will be required to provide additional capital over and above your initial investment. Instead of additional investment, your investment may be diluted if more money is needed or the transaction requires member loans at a high rate of interest (10%–15%). If member loans are necessary, your equity position in the investment would be subordinated to those member loans, and the loans would have to be paid back before any equity distributions are made.
Greater Control than REITs — When you invest in a REIT, you are investing in a portfolio of real estate properties, but you have little information and even less control over the individual investments. With Realty Mogul you can invest in individual properties, including those close to your home. In fact, Realty Mogul allows you to be very specific with your real estate investments.
REIT (New) — The recently introduced MogulREIT I allows non-accredited investors to invest in real estate.


 Cons

Accredited Investor  — You must have an annual income of at least $200,000 (or $300,000 for a couple) or a net worth of more than $1 million -- and that doesn’t include the value of your personal residence. Though the recently introduced MogulREIT is for non-accredited investors.
Investments Are Illiquid — There is no secondary market to sell your positions and must hold to maturity.


Invest in Commercial Real Estate with Realty Mogul

Summary
Realty Mogul offers a unique opportunity to invest in real estate that’s less involved than buying a property outright on an individual basis, but it is much deeper in scope than investing in real estate through a real estate investment trust (REIT). It’s an opportunity to invest in real estate through a variety of close-to-home investment opportunities.
The disadvantages are that you must be an accredited investor, which is to say that if you’re a small investor, you cannot participate.

MogulREIT I FAQs

What is MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. MogulREIT I intends to qualify as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2016.

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT?

MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.

Who can invest in MogulREIT? 

MogulREIT is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors must have net worth and annual income greater than $10,000. 

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT?

The minimum investment is $1,000.

Can I invest in MogulREIT I using a SDIRA (Self-Directed IRA) or other type of retirement account?

Yes. We have added the ability to take retirement funds into MogulREIT I. This means you can use your SDIRA to make investments.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT?

In the first quarter of 2017 we updated our Redemption Plan (now referred to as the Share Repurchase Program) to allow for a higher repurchase rate, faster. Share Repurchases from MogulREIT I are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the share repurchase rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT is different since investment decisions are made by our Manager and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

RealtyMogul.com has a highly experienced team of real estate finance professionals, led by Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at RealtyMogul.com have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. The Company benefits from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles. Learn more.
The credit team of RealtyMogul.com is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. RealtyMogul.com’s Chief Credit Officer, Megan Goodfellow, has been involved in institutional finance for three decades, specializing in the analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies.  Ms. Goodfellow has assembled a strong team of credit and underwriting professionals whose expertise has been honed in the service of RealtyMogul.com, and which will be brought to bear for MogulREIT’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on our investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If the fund chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the fund, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

For institutional investors, we are a source of efficient and technology-based production, helping them diversify their portfolio while getting access to a wide suite of commercial debt products.

What types of investments does RealtyMogul.com offer?

On RealtyMogul.com, you can invest in two primary investment types: loans (debt) or equity:

Real Estate Loans (debt): In this investment type, investors purchase a specific loan or a pool of loans.  The underlying loan is tied to a residential or commercial property and the loan is secured by the property until the borrower repays the loan in full.  Investors earn monthly interest on their money typically with a balloon payment at the end.  Hold periods for the loans could be as short as a few months and as long as a few years.
Equity Investments:  In this investment type, we focus on equity investments with existing cash-flow, like apartment buildings, office buildings, retail shopping centers, and self-storage facilities. With this type of investment, investors pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific property or a pool of properties.  The investment is acquired and managed by a professional real estate investment company, also known as a “sponsor”, with a track record of acquiring and managing real estate.  Investors are typically entitled to a share of the cash-flow from rents as well as a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold.  The hold period for an investment like this may range from 1-10 years.


How does an investment opportunity get listed on RealtyMogul.com?

Real estate companies or individuals list their investment opportunities in the RealtyMogul.com marketplace only after joining RealtyMogul.com, submitting an application, and going through an underwriting and due diligence process.
For equity investments, the RealtyMogul.com underwriting team along with our broker-dealer partner, North Capital, reviews their materials and determines whether the company and the investment is a good fit for our members. We go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including return structure, market statistics, quality of the property and the track record, reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with. This process also includes background, criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud. Finally, we always tour the property as a final step before it is listed. We reject many equity transactions that are proposed to us, keeping in mind one of our core values - Investor Protection.
At RealtyMogul.com, we look for transactions that provide cash flow to investors as quickly as possible.  Some properties may have some level of vacancy or have the ability for our operating partner to add value and increase cash flow over the life of the investment.  We do not currently fund ground-up development, as we believe one of the benefits of real estate investing is passive income and development projects typically take 18-36 months to generate income. We do fund apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, hotels, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.
For debt investments, RealtyMogul.com provides loans for commercial properties including apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.  We examine many variables when evaluating debt investment opportunities.  For loans on commercial properties, we evaluate metrics including debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, and debt yields. Regardless of loan type, we look for borrowers with a successful track record and make sure they undergo background and credit checks so we can ensure financial competence and responsibility.
The liens associated with our debt are frequently “senior” or in “first position,” so in the event of a borrower default, our investors have first claim to the proceeds in the event of a foreclosure.  Most of these loans are short-term, ranging from 6-36 months before principal is repaid. We may from time to time offer debt in the second position (mezzanine debt), which is subordinate to our more frequent offering of senior debt.  Investors are always made aware of the debt position prior to making an investment decision.

Are the investments secure?

Although no investment is guaranteed, one benefit of investing with RealtyMogul.com is that you are investing in physical assets around the United States. Your investment is in an actual property as opposed to a stock or bond or other non-physical asset.

Are these investments risky?

Yes. Similar to investing in the stock market, there is no guarantee when you are investing in real estate. The real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change.

Does RealtyMogul.com do background or credit checks when new investors register with the site?

Yes. Our broker-dealer, North Capital, runs KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering on all who invest in deals on our site. Additionally, on some offerings where advertising may have been used, some additional verification of an investor’s status as an accredited investor may be required.

Is there an investment minimum?

Yes. The minimum investment is different for each investment, but can be as low as $1,000. 

Are there fees for investors?

Joining RealtyMogul.com and browsing the marketplace requires no obligation. For those who choose to invest, there are fees associated with each investment.  The fees depend on the type of investment (loan purchase or equity purchase) and the nature of the transaction.  In addition to administrative and legal expenses, the fees will cover the ongoing reporting and communications for the investments. As we are big believers in transparency, you can find the specific fee structure for each deal when you browse through our investment opportunities.

How does the investment process work?

An investment is not final until all legal documents are signed and funding has been contributed and cleared.  When an investor makes their investment, the money is held securely at a US bank.  Once the fundraising target is met and the real estate transaction is completed, the money is transferred for the sole purpose of the specific loan or specific property that is being invested in.

How do investors transfer funds to RealtyMogul.com?

Standard ACH transfer can be made from an investor’s bank account for amounts up to $100,000. Amounts larger than $100,000 are made using a wire transfer. For each investment opportunity there will be specific account numbers that we will provide to the investor so that funds are properly received on our end.

How are legal documents handled on RealtyMogul.com?

All legal documents can be sent and signed electronically through our website. This allows for more efficient and seamless transfer of documents between you and RealtyMogul.com, while maintaining the authenticity and security of your information. Investments are finalized once proper legal documentation is accepted, funds are confirmed received, and we provide you with completed counterpart signatures.

Can I use an SDIRA or other type of IRA for my investment and cash flow distributions?

At this time, we can (and regularly do) process debt investments made through a self-directed IRA account, but it will depend on your custodian's processes/procedures.  Our two requirements are that the custodian be able to process documents via electronic signatures, and that it be able to process contributions and distributions via ACH transfer payments. Unfortunately, some custodians have problems meeting these conditions; inquire of your current custodian whether they can work with these requirements, and if not, we can refer you over to other providers who can meet these guidelines.

How will investors be updated about their investment status?

Investors will be able to view real time updates of their investments when they login to the site and view their investor dashboard.  This is their hub of information, and will provide comprehensive metrics about their distributions to date, upcoming milestones, and overall return on investment.  Additional emails are sent out when distributions are sent to your bank account.

Once invested, how do investors get regular updates about their investments?

RealtyMogul.com will work with the real estate company to provide timely updates shared with all investors at least quarterly.  Updates will be provided via email and via the investor dashboard. In addition, investors will receive tax documents every year that they have a distribution from a real estate investment on RealtyMogul.com.

How will my investment cash flow allocations be distributed?

Investors who invest in debt typically receive interest payments on a monthly basis, while investors who invest in equity typically receive quarterly distributions.
Usually we will send the cash flow income to the same bank account that the investor provided for their original investment, though we can accommodate changing a distribution bank account by request.  We ask for bank information that will allow for monthly or quarterly standard ACH transfers.
Distributions are never guaranteed in amount or timing and you should carefully read the offering documents on the specific deal you are interested in to fully understand how projected distributions look like and what risks are involved.

Is my investment liquid?

No.  The real estate investments found on RealtyMogul.com are private transactions in physical properties around the United States.  The investments are not traded on public stock exchanges and cannot be easily sold or traded.
You may be able to resell your investment security in a private transaction subject to restrictions that are specific to each investment and under the Securities Act of 1933. Since the resale restrictions on RealtyMogul.com can be very limiting, you should not invest with the expectation of reselling your investment.

When will I get my investment back?

Different properties have different expected hold periods.  A hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is re-sold or the loan on it is paid off.  It is important to read the offering documents for each investment opportunity for a deeper understanding of the hold period for each investment.

I see the name North Capital on your website. Who is North Capital?

North Capital is RealtyMogul.com’s broker-dealer partner who provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyMogul.com.

What happens if RealtyMogul.com goes out of business? 

In the event of a corporate bankruptcy, there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide, however, we would work to put replacement servicers in place for all RealtyMogul.com transactions.

 




Invest in Equity



What types of properties are available through equity investments?

RealtyMogul.com offers access to a variety of property types including, but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality.

How are equity investments structured?

Investors are typically purchasing shares in a Realty Mogul Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) that in turn invests into an LLC or Limited Partnership (“LP”) that holds title to the real property.

When I invest in equity investments on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in an equity opportunity, you are typically purchasing shares of an LLC as a limited member. In turn, that LLC owns (directly or indirectly), along with the sponsor and other investors, a share of a joint venture entity that owns a specific investment property, like a specific apartment building. An LLC gives you liability protection, shielding your personal assets from the investment.

Why do investors invest into a Realty Mogul LLC instead of directly into the company that holds title to the real property?

By investing into a Realty Mogul LLC, it minimizes overhead for the sponsors who work with RealtyMogul.com and allows us to access more investment opportunities for investors. It also allows for streamlined reporting, distributions, and tax documentation through the RealtyMogul.com platform.

Who makes decisions in an LLC?

Decisions in an LLC are governed by a document called an “operating agreement”. While every operating agreement is slightly different, they usually include a manager (who may also be a member) and limited members. The manager typically makes all of the day-to-day decisions and the limited members act as passive investors on the transaction. The manager can determine how much cash to distribute to the limited members versus how much to hold in reserve and assess possible sales for the property. There are certain activities that might mandate a vote by the limited members and the limited members can typically take action if the managing member defaults on the terms of the agreement or is grossly negligent.

Who makes decisions in the Realty Mogul LLC that investors contribute to?

RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com is typically the Managing Member of Realty Mogul LLCs.  RM Manager is an Exempt Reporting Advisor. RM Manager does not own a piece of the Realty Mogul LLCs, but is responsible for certain limited decision making. However, you will need to review the specific offering materials for each investment to fully understand the structure and the duties of all entities involved.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to equity investors each quarter. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What if I invested in equity and more money is needed for the property in the future? Am I obligated to invest more as an equity owner?

RealtyMogul.com investments typically do not have capital calls.  A capital call is where the investor is required to commit more money to the property, beyond the initial investment.  Rather than requiring an additional investment, it is possible that investors will be diluted if more money needs to be raised. While this is typically the case with equity investments offered on RealtyMogul.com, please check the offering materials for each investment to fully understand your liabilities as an investor.

What are the tax implications of investing in Equity opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

One of the benefits of investing in real estate equity through limited liability companies (LLCs) is that LLCs can be treated as partnerships for tax purposes. Partnerships generally are not taxed at the entity level (other than annual franchise taxes and filing fees) and can “pass through” applicable items of income, loss and depreciation to their members.

Non-cash depreciation deductions can shelter or eliminate the amount taxable income that may be otherwise passed through to an investor from a real estate equity investment, particularly in the early stages of the investment. As a result, cash distributions received by an investor, in a year when there is no corresponding pass-through of taxable income (again, due to depreciation deductions), may result in lower or deferred taxes.
The special purpose entity (a Realty Mogul LLC) you own when you invest in an equity transaction reports your annual share of income and loss and distributions on federal and state K-1s that you can then use to prepare your tax return. While the special purpose entities (the Realty Mogul LLCs) that are formed for each equity transaction typically are Delaware entities, there may be filing requirements and tax liabilities in other states depending on the details of a particular transaction, your state of residence, and the location of the investment property.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.

 




Invest in Debt



What types of loan/debt investments can investors make?

When investing in loans, investors will either acquire a borrower payment dependent promissory note (a “Platform Note”) from Realty Mogul, Co. or purchase a whole loan.

When I invest in a Platform Note on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in a Platform Note, you are purchasing an unsecured note in Realty Mogul, Co., the performance of which is tied to the underlying real estate loan.  This Platform Note allows you to receive periodic payments on the loan if and when the borrower on the underlying real estate loan makes interest payments.

Are Platform Notes secured by real estate?

No, the Platform Notes are not secured by real estate.

When Investing in Platform Notes, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

No, an investor will not need to fund additional amounts once the initial investment has been made.

Who is eligible to buy whole loans?

Institutional investors looking to invest >$25 million are eligible to buy whole loans from RealtyMogul.com. These whole loans differ from the Platform Notes in that they are secured by real estate.

When investing in whole loans, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

Yes, an investor will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default when purchasing whole loans.

If a borrower stops paying, what happens?

If a borrower stops paying, we will determine what loan modification or loss mitigation options to pursue before beginning foreclosure proceedings. RealtyMogul.com will inform all investors if any significant actions are taken on their specific loan investments.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to debt investors each month. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What are the tax implications of investing in Debt opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

Tax information regarding first lien debt investments is reported annually to investors on Form 1099.  For other types of debt (like mezzanine debt), distributions may be characterized as interest, dividends, or other distributions, and investors may receive either a Form 1099 or a Federal and state Form K-1, depending on the structure of the transaction.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.


 




Invest in MogulREIT



What is MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. 

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multifamily, office, industrial, self-storage, and retail real estate opportunities. MogulREIT I can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt assets across these different property types

Who can invest in MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. For non-accredited investors, limitations based on the investor’s annual income or net worth apply to the amount that may be invested.

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT I?

For most investors, the minimum investment is $1,000 and investors may invest additional capital in increments of $1,000.
For Self-Directed IRA (“SDIRA”) investors, the minimum investment is $10,000 and $1,000 thereafter.
For a Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) account, the minimum investment is $25,000 for the first transaction and $1,000 thereafter.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT I?

Redemptions from the fund are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the redemptions rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT I different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform currently offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT I is different since investment decisions are made by its Manager, RM Adviser, LLC, and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT I is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform. RM Adviser, LLC charges a 1% asset management fee for managing MogulREIT I and its investments, whereas the other investment opportunities offered through the RealtyMogul.com Platform may charge fees that are higher or lower. Finally, MogulREIT I is set up as a “blind pool” REIT, which means that it is not committed to acquiring any particular investments with the net proceeds of its offering. Investing in MogulREIT I can lead to greater diversification because MogulREIT I intends to invest its assets in multiple real estate opportunities. However, unlike other investments on the RealtyMogul.com Platform, a purchaser of common shares in MogulREIT I may not know what investments MogulREIT I will make with its assets at the time the investor purchases common shares in MogulREIT I.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is managed by RM Adviser, LLC, a SEC registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of Realty Mogul, Co. RM Adviser, which manages MogulREIT I’s day-to-day operations, will have access to the experienced team of real estate finance professionals employed by Realty Mogul, Co., including Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at Realty Mogul have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. MogulREIT I expects to benefit from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles.
The credit team of Realty Mogul and its affiliates is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. This team has substantial experience in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments and has adopted approaches used by real estate finance industry leaders in its analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies, and these approaches will be brought to bear for MogulREIT I’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on MogulREIT I’s investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If MogulREIT I chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the REIT, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

 




Invest in 1031



What is a 1031 Exchange?

A 1031 exchange is a strategy for deferring the capital gains tax from the sale of a property. By exchanging a relinquished property for like-kind real estate, owners may be able to defer their federal taxes and use the proceeds for the purchase of replacement property.

What is “like-kind property”?

Generally any form of property held for business or investment purposes qualifies including Apartment Buildings, Single-Family Rentals, Vacant Land, Office Buildings, Self-Storage Facilities, Shopping Centers, and Hotels. These property types may be 1031 eligible properties.

What does it mean to be “1031 eligible”?

Not all real estate investments are eligible for 1031 exchanges. In order for your investment in real property to be 1031 eligible you must have a direct ownership in the underlying real estate. Debt investments aren’t eligible because they are interests in a promissory note, not the underlying real estate. Similarly, partnership interests (including LLC’s) where an investor owns a share of a partnership interest instead of a share of the underlying real estate would be ineligible. However, per the IRS’s Revenue Ruling 2004-86, ownership of a beneficiary interest in a Delaware Statutory Trust does qualify to be part of an investor’s 1031 Exchange.

What is a Delaware Statutory Trust Property?

Commonly known as “DST”, this entity is often used to hold title to real estate similar to an LLC. Instead of owning a membership interest in an LLC, a DST investor owns a beneficial interest in the DST. Also like an LLC, the entity shields the investor from individual liability. However, unlike an LLC, a DST 1031 property will qualify as a “like kind” exchange replacement property for a 1031 exchange per Internal Revenue Ruling 2004-86.

What are the downsides of investing in a DST?


      The DST is typically managed by the DST Trustee and the beneficial owners do not have voting right like they would typically have in an LLC. Instead the DST and therefore the real property investments held by the DST are managed by the Trustee, not the investors themselves. Additionally, the IRS established seven prohibitions over the powers of the DST Trustee, which includes the following:
      
Once the offering is closed, there can be no future equity contribution to the DST by either current or new co-investors or beneficiaries.
The DST Trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans, nor can it borrow any new funds from any other lender or party.
The DST Trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its investment real estate.
The DST Trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property to those for a) normal repair and maintenance, (b) minor non-structural capital improvements, and (c) those required by law.
Any liquid cash held in the DST between distribution dates can only be invested in short-term debt obligations.
All cash, other than necessary reserves, must be distributed to the co-investors or beneficiaries on a current basis, and
The Trustee cannot enter into new leases or renegotiate the current leases.


What is a Springing LLC?

DST Agreements often contain a provision that allows the Trustee to convert the DST to an LLC (the “Springing LLC”) if the Trustee determines that the DST is in danger of losing the property due to its inability to act because of the prohibitions in the trust agreement. The conversion to an LLC will allow the Trustee, who becomes the Manager of the LLC to raise additional funds, renegotiate terms of existing debt, and enter into new leases. However, because a membership interest in a Springing LLC is not a 1031 eligible the members (investors) lose their ability to defer capital gains upon the sale of the property owned by the LLC through another 1031 exchange.

What are the basic requirements to complete a 1031 Exchange?


      The following is a list of the basic elements involved in typical 1031 Exchanges:
      
A Qualified Intermediary, sometimes referred to as a “1031 Accommodator” is used to exchange the funds from the real estate that is sold to the real estate that is purchased.
Investors identify their replacement properties (typically 3 properties) with their 1031 Accommodator within 45 days of sale of the initial property.
Investors reinvest 100% of the net sales proceeds from the initial property sale into their replacement properties.
Investors acquire an equal or greater amount of debt on the replacement properties than they had on their initial properties.
Investors close on the purchase of the replacement properties within 180 days of the sale of their initial property.

1031 Exchanges can be very complicated and you should consult with your CPA and Attorney before proceeding with an exchange.

Can I invest if I do not currently own a 1031 eligible property?

Yes. “Cash Investors” are investors who use non-1031 money to invest in a 1031 eligible deal. Once they have completed their investment, those investment funds become 1031 eligible and can be used as part of a 1031 exchange in the future.

MogulREIT: RealtyMogul.com to Use Reg A+ to Allow Non-Accreds to Invest in Real Estate
 Tweet Share1 Share35 +12 Reddit Pin1 EmailShares 39

August 16, 2016 @ 9:00 am By JD Alois 


RealtyMogul.com has launched their first REIT (real estate investment trust) labeled the MogulReit I.  The new investment vehicle will allow non-accredited investors access to commercial real estate investment opportunities. MogulReit will be using Reg A+ and thus may raise up to $50 million.  RealtyMogul.com described the new offer as democratizing real estate investing.  Previously only accredited investors (individuals earning $200,000 a year or more or with a net worth of $1 million) could invest in real estate online. RealtyMogul has now opened their platform up to millions of more potential investors.
Investors may participate in the MogulREIT with a minimum $2500 investment (@$10 per share) gaining access to a diversified portfolio of real estate in a single purchase.  Property assets will include multifamily, retail, self-storage and office. The offering circular for the MogulREIT may be accessed here.
RealtyMogul.com explained that the MogulREIT is designed to have low fees;
Traditional non-traded REITs employ a highly manpower-intensive sales method, resulting in upfront sales commissions of 7 percent, on average, and total expenses of up to 15%. By offering MogulREIT I exclusively on RealtyMogul.com, it affords investors direct online access to the product with no sales commission and offering expenses capped at 3 percent.
RealtyMogul.com CEO Jilliene Helman said the MogulREIT would allow them to leverage the “hundreds of inbound inquiries” to finance commercial real estate and to curate the very best for financing. RealtyMogul.com’s approach to real estate investment is described as conservative when selecting transactions to offer for investment. The platform states it only invests in cash-flowing properties and will not invest in land or ground up development transactions.  This approach will carry through to MogulREIT I.
Helman told Crowdfund Insider;
“[This is] important to let non-accreds in.  Our core mission is “Access through Innovation” and we wanted to provide broader access to investors.  We also wanted to launch a diversified commercial real estate fund open to as many investors as possible.”
Helman said that both debt and equity opportunities will be incorporated in the “flexible investment strategy.”
“We’re looking forward to executing against our twofold objective for the fund: providing investors with both consistent cash distributions and the opportunity to benefit from potential appreciation in property values,” added Helman.
Helman said RealtyMogul.com would continue to offer stand alone property investments under Reg D. When asked if the MogulREIT concept would be expanded into other targeted sectors of real estate, Helman stated;
“Right now we’re focused on making MogulREIT 1 a success and the intent with this offering is to diversify across geographies and property types.”
RealtyMogul.com is not the first real estate crowdfunding platform to launch a REIT using Reg  A+, as created by the JOBS Act of 2012. Fundrise launched the concept last year and has since driven the bulk of success under Reg A+ offers having publicly announced $72 million in transactions. RealtyMogul.com is the largest real estate crowdfunding platform in the US having surpassed $200 million in transactions.

RealtyMogul.com, a leading online marketplace for commercial real estate investing, today announced the launch of its first commercial real estate fund, MogulREIT I. Structured as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with a minimum investment of $2,500, the fund is open to nearly all* investors and offers the potential for consistent cash dividends and equity appreciation.
MogulREIT I has been designed to offer investors a number of distinct advantages. By investing in the “REIT,” investors will gain access to a diversified pool of commercial real estate investments with one single investment. The fund intends to invest in a variety of commercial real estate, including multifamily, retail, self-storage and office.
The fund is also designed to have low fees. Traditional non-traded “REITs” employ a highly manpower-intensive sales method, resulting in upfront sales commissions of 7 percent, on average, and total expenses of up to 15 percent.** By offering MogulREIT I exclusively on its platform, RealtyMogul.com affords investors direct online access to the product with no sales commission and offering expenses capped at 3 percent.***
“Beyond the zero commissions and lower fees, the fund’s strategy is exciting because it allows us to leverage RealtyMogul.com’s hundreds of inbound inquiries for financing on commercial real estate and curate them to find suitable opportunities,” said RealtyMogul.com CEO Jilliene Helman.
Within the universe of commercial real estate investing, RealtyMogul.com’s experienced real estate team takes a relatively conservative approach when selecting transactions to offer for investment: the platform only invests in cash-flowing properties and won’t invest in land or ground up development transactions. This approach will carry through to MogulREIT I.
“Through a flexible investment strategy, we can invest in both debt and equity as well as various property types and geographies, allowing us to be opportunistic. We’re looking forward to executing against our twofold objective for the fund: providing investors with both consistent cash distributions and the opportunity to benefit from potential appreciation in property values,” added Helman.
The launch of the “REIT” marks a new wave of opportunity to invest in real estate. Until recently, private investment markets have been off-limits to the majority of retail investors. However, recent legislation like Regulation A+ and Title III of the JOBS Act has leveled the playing field by allowing non-accredited investors making less than $200,000 per year to access these investment opportunities through online crowdfunding. Through Reg A+, MogulREIT I gives nearly all investors a new entrance to curated and pre-vetted private real estate investing.
“Our members have demonstrated a clear appetite for a range of real estate investments, and we’re proud to be able to provide that opportunity to even more investors through our first ‘REIT’ offering,” said Helman.
In May, RealtyMogul.com announced that, since its inception in 2013, the platform had surpassed $200 million in crowdfunded real estate equity and debt transactions.

RealtyMogul.com MogulREIT Lowers Minimum Investment to $1000
 Tweet Share210 Share275 +11 Reddit Pin EmailShares 486

December 2, 2016 @ 7:06 am By JD Alois 


RealtyMogul.com has lowered the minimum necessary to invest in their first REIT or MogulREIT I to $1,000. Previously, the minimum investment was $2,500. RealtyMogul.com CEO Jilliene Helman said their goal was to give more investors the opportunity to invest in unique real estate investments on their platform.
RealtyMogul.com‘s MogulREIT uses updated securities exemption Reg A+ to allow both accredited and non-accredited investors participate in real estate crowdfunding offers.
“Our goal in launching MogulREIT I in August was to give more investors the opportunity to invest in real estate,” said Helman. “The new, lower $1,000 minimum investment makes it even easier for just about everyone to participate.”
Last month, MogulREIT I declared its first dividend that is on track for an 8% annualized return. RealtyMogul.com said this was a premium over many other non-traded REITs which average 5.4%, according to the Stranger Report.
“The new, lower minimum for MogulREIT I also gives our single property investors the opportunity to try something new and innovative,” added Helman. “At the new minimum, investors can now test the product through a small investment, gain exposure to the fast-growing online REIT asset class and subsequently add the potential for additional cash flow to their portfolios.”
MogulREIT I seeks to provide consistent income for investors with a diversified portfolio of real estate assets.
RealtyMogul.com continues to offer single property investments for accredited investors.
Since platform launch, RealtyMogul.com has raised over $230 million for real estate assets returning more than $50 million to investors in both principle and realized returns.

MogulREIT I FAQs

What is MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. MogulREIT I intends to qualify as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2016.

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT?

MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.

Who can invest in MogulREIT? 

MogulREIT is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors must have net worth and annual income greater than $10,000. 

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT?

The minimum investment is $1,000.

Can I invest in MogulREIT I using a SDIRA (Self-Directed IRA) or other type of retirement account?

Yes. We have added the ability to take retirement funds into MogulREIT I. This means you can use your SDIRA to make investments.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT?

In the first quarter of 2017 we updated our Redemption Plan (now referred to as the Share Repurchase Program) to allow for a higher repurchase rate, faster. Share Repurchases from MogulREIT I are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the share repurchase rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT is different since investment decisions are made by our Manager and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

RealtyMogul.com has a highly experienced team of real estate finance professionals, led by Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at RealtyMogul.com have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. The Company benefits from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles. Learn more.
The credit team of RealtyMogul.com is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. RealtyMogul.com’s Chief Credit Officer, Megan Goodfellow, has been involved in institutional finance for three decades, specializing in the analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies.  Ms. Goodfellow has assembled a strong team of credit and underwriting professionals whose expertise has been honed in the service of RealtyMogul.com, and which will be brought to bear for MogulREIT’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on our investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If the fund chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the fund, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.
