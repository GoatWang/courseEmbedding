Russell S. Minick Named President of Electrolux Home Care Products - Leader Brings Home Industry Experience and Central Vacuum Expertise to Role as Head of EHCP



Share Article

















AB Electrolux of Sweden has named Russell S. Minick president and CEO for Electrolux Home Care Products (EHCP), the Group's operation for floor care and small appliances in North America, which includes the Electrolux, Eureka and Sanitaire brands and the division Electrolux Central Vacuum Systems (formerly Beam Industries).






Bloomington, IL (PRWEB)
August 25, 2008
 AB Electrolux of Sweden has named Russell S. Minick president and CEO for Electrolux Home Care Products (EHCP), the Group's operation for floor care and small appliances in North America, which includes the Electrolux, Eureka and Sanitaire brands and the division Electrolux Central Vacuum Systems (formerly Beam Industries).  Minick most recently served as president of the Electrolux Central Vacuum Systems division.  He replaces John Case, who is leaving the company to pursue a new opportunity. 
"Russ is a hands-on leader who is flexible, practical and results-oriented," said Morten Falkenberg, president and CEO of floor care and small appliances for AB Electrolux, the parent company of EHCP.  "With his broad experience from different types of businesses, I'm confident that Russ is well prepared to build on the recent successes in North America to continue to take our floor care business to the next level."
Minick will assume his new position on Sept. 1, 2008, and will report to Falkenberg.  
"I'm thrilled to broaden my reach within the company to work with each of our well-known, distinct brands and lead the excellent team already in place," said Minick.  "EHCP has an unwavering focus on customer-driven innovation, and I understand the importance of that commitment to our overall success in the marketplace."
Minick has served as president of the Electrolux Central Vacuum Systems division, which manufactures and ships central vacuums to 45 countries throughout the world, since June 2006.  He joined the organization with extensive management expertise, including prior experience as president of HNI Corporation's The Gunlocke Company, a contract office furniture company focusing on private office case goods, conference room furniture, lounge furniture and executive seating.  As leader of this $100 million company, Minick led a staff of approximately 885 employees, launched several high impact new products and grew revenue significantly. 
Before HNI, Minick was the senior vice president of sales, marketing and product development at True Temper Sports, where he was responsible for growing revenue, developing new lines of business and new products.  Minick also worked at Ford Motor Company as the general manager, extended warranty operations, where he had full responsibility for the company's global extended warranty business.
Minick began his career with Maytag Corporation in a variety of sales leadership positions of escalating responsibility, culminating with the role of director of national accounts.  In this position, Minick was responsible for all the sales, marketing, product development and logistics for Maytag's largest customers.
"Russ has a track record of success in industries undergoing great change, and we look forward to seeing his leadership in action as he ushers Electrolux Home Care Products into its next phase," said Falkenberg.
Minick graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in marketing and a minor in business communication from the University of Northern Iowa.
An internal and external search is underway to identify the new head of Electrolux Central Vacuum Systems.
