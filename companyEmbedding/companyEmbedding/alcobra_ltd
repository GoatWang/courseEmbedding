Company history[edit]
Alcobra was founded in 2008. In 2013, the company completed an initial public offering (IPO) and trades under the symbol “ADHD” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
Products in development[edit]
Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) is the company’s lead investigational product candidate. Metadoxine Extended Release is a monoamine-independent modulator of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transmission. The mechanism of action does not directly affect dopamine or norepinephrine. The compound is not a psychostimulant. Metadoxine has shown no potential for abuse or addiction in studies completed to date.[1]
ADHD[edit]
Alcobra has completed two Phase II trials[2][3] and one Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD.[4] Alcobra has also completed one Phase II adolescent ADHD study of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX).[5] In mid-2015, Alcobra began a second Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD, called the MEASURE study.
Fragile X syndrome[edit]
In December 2013, the FDA granted "Orphan Drug" designation to Metadoxine in the treatment of fragile X syndrome.[6] In June 2015, Alcobra completed a Phase II clinical trial of MDX for the treatment of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome.[7] In September 2015, the FDA granted “Fast Track” status to Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) for fragile X syndrome.[8]

Company history[edit]
Alcobra was founded in 2008. In 2013, the company completed an initial public offering (IPO) and trades under the symbol “ADHD” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
Products in development[edit]
Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) is the company’s lead investigational product candidate. Metadoxine Extended Release is a monoamine-independent modulator of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transmission. The mechanism of action does not directly affect dopamine or norepinephrine. The compound is not a psychostimulant. Metadoxine has shown no potential for abuse or addiction in studies completed to date.[1]
ADHD[edit]
Alcobra has completed two Phase II trials[2][3] and one Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD.[4] Alcobra has also completed one Phase II adolescent ADHD study of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX).[5] In mid-2015, Alcobra began a second Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD, called the MEASURE study.
Fragile X syndrome[edit]
In December 2013, the FDA granted "Orphan Drug" designation to Metadoxine in the treatment of fragile X syndrome.[6] In June 2015, Alcobra completed a Phase II clinical trial of MDX for the treatment of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome.[7] In September 2015, the FDA granted “Fast Track” status to Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) for fragile X syndrome.[8]

ALCOBRA LTD Company Profile


   If it were that easy to treat ADHD, Alcobra would wave a magic wand and say "Abracadabra!" Instead, the Israeli company is developing a new type of drug to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The drug candidate, MG01CI, differs from traditional pharmaceuticals prescribed to manage ADHD in that it is not a stimulant like its well-known counterparts Adderall and Ritalin. MG01CI aims to be a safer alternative for patients who cannot tolerate the side effects, such as insomnia and high blood pressure, associated with stimulants. The company teamed up with equity investor Teva to complete a Phase II study in adults in 2011. Alcobra went public in the US in 2013.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Company history[edit]
Alcobra was founded in 2008. In 2013, the company completed an initial public offering (IPO) and trades under the symbol “ADHD” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
Products in development[edit]
Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) is the company’s lead investigational product candidate. Metadoxine Extended Release is a monoamine-independent modulator of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transmission. The mechanism of action does not directly affect dopamine or norepinephrine. The compound is not a psychostimulant. Metadoxine has shown no potential for abuse or addiction in studies completed to date.[1]
ADHD[edit]
Alcobra has completed two Phase II trials[2][3] and one Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD.[4] Alcobra has also completed one Phase II adolescent ADHD study of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX).[5] In mid-2015, Alcobra began a second Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD, called the MEASURE study.
Fragile X syndrome[edit]
In December 2013, the FDA granted "Orphan Drug" designation to Metadoxine in the treatment of fragile X syndrome.[6] In June 2015, Alcobra completed a Phase II clinical trial of MDX for the treatment of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome.[7] In September 2015, the FDA granted “Fast Track” status to Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) for fragile X syndrome.[8]

Alcobra has completed two Phase II trials[2][3] and one Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD.[4] Alcobra has also completed one Phase II adolescent ADHD study of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX).[5] In mid-2015, Alcobra began a second Phase III trial of Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX) in adults with ADHD, called the MEASURE study.
