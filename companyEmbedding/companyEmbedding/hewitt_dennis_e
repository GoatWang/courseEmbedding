About the Author

 Paul G. Hewitt was a Silver Medalist flyweight Boxing Champion for New England States at the age of 17.

Conceptual Physics was first published in 1971, while Hewitt was teaching at City College of San Francisco. He has also served as a guest lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Cruz, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the University of Hawaii at Hilo. Hewitt returned to San Francisco to teach at the City College and the well-known science museum, The Exploratorium.

You may contact us by phone (800-500-8384), email (contactus@relieffactor.com), or live chat on our website.
                            



Q: What is your return/refund policy?






                                A: We accept returns of any Relief Factor product that has the original blue and green bag intact, unopened, and unmarked in any way. To return Relief Factor product, simply write "refused" on the outside of the white mailing package and place it in your mailbox or take it to your local post office. Once we receive it back, we will issue a refund less the cost of shipping. If the outer, white package has been opened, you must pay the return shipping costs.
                            

                            Return Address:

Q: How do I make modifications on my account?






                                A: To update your credit card, change your address, or modify your shipping schedule or date, simply call us at 800-500-8384 (Monday-Friday, 5am - 7pm, PST). You can also make the above changes (with the exception of your credit card updates) through email (contactus@relieffactor.com) or live chat at our website.
                            



Q: Why was I sent another package so soon?






                                A: We send your first monthly package (60 ct.) 15 days after your QuickStart is ordered, so that you do not run out of product or have an interruption in your pain relief. After that, we send your monthly packages every 30 days. If you prefer not to have your packages arrive on an regular schedule, you are welcome to cancel your subscription and order on an “as needed” basis but without your Preferred Membership discount.
                            



Q: Do you ship to other countries?






                                A: We are unable to ship outside the United States at this time.
                            



Q: Can I order Relief Factor without a membership?






                                A: The QuickStart order enrolls you in our Preferred Membership program, which gives you a substantially reduced rate on orders. If you prefer to purchase Relief Factor as needed, please contact our customer care department for assistance. We are available at 800-500-8384, Monday-Friday, 5am - 7pm, PST.
                            



Q: What are the exact amounts of each ingredient in Relief Factor?






                                A: You can find our ingredient label on the “Ingredients” tab on this page.
                            



Q: What does DOM mean? Is my Relief Factor expired?






                                A: DOM stands for date of manufacture. The shelf life is 2 years from the date of manufacture. Supplements don’t “expire” the way food might but rather begin to slowly lose potency past their 2 year shelf life.
                            



Q: What are the testing protocols for your supplements?





 
                                A: Our manufacturers obtain and provide certifications of the quality of our nutritional components prior to the packaging of each Relief Factor product.
                            



Q: Who manufactures your supplements?






                                A: Our supplements are manufactured in the US by companies that use the FDA’s GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices).
                            



Q: What kind of oil does Omega-3 come from?






                                A: Our Omega-3 is derived from wild caught mackerel, anchovy, and sardine oil, molecularly distilled to remove impurities such as mercury and other heavy metals.
                            



Q: Does Relief Factor contain wheat or gluten?






                                A: There is no wheat or gluten in Relief Factor.
                            



Q: Does Relief Factor contain soy?






                                A: Relief Factor does contain trace amounts of soy, as the Vitamin E in our Omega-3 capsule is derived from soy.
                            



Q: Is this a vegan-friendly product?






                                A: The dry capsules are botanical, and contain no animal products, so they should fit anybody’s definition of vegan. On the other hand, the Omega-3 acids are extracted from fish oil and placed inside a soft gel made of beef gelatin, which would disqualify the supplements from vegan diets.
                            



Q: Is Relief Factor Kosher?






                                A: No. Beef gelatin is used for the soft gels in our product. Vegetable gelatin isn’t something that works well for the stability of soft gels.
                            



Q: Are Relief Factor’s ingredients grown with pesticides?






                                A: These are not organically grown herbs, so there is a possibility of pesticides/herbicides, but this doesn’t mean that any were used. The herbs may technically be organic but the supplier may not have decided to go through the costly process of obtaining true organic certification.
                            



Q: Are there any side effects from taking Relief Factor?






                                A: There may be some stomach upset in the beginning, especially if you are not used to taking supplements. Taking them with food will help. The fish oil capsul may cause some loose stool, and a few people have reported dry mouth, dizziness and nosebleeds, but these have been rare. Most people find that the symptoms ease as their body adjusts to the supplements. We recommend taking probiotics to help with stomach upset. There have been no major contraindications with prescription medications and Relief Factor. It is always suggested to consult with a physician before beginning a supplement regimen.
                            



Q: Does Relief Factor contain potassium?






                                A: Any significant amount of potassium would have to be a label claim in the SFP (supplement facts panel). There should be no residual potassium; however, the formula isn’t tested for this mineral (or any minerals actually) as these are not normally present in herbal extracts.

Click on any one of the services below to view more information.



+ WE OFFER AN IN-DEPTH TAX INTERVIEW


We ask questions to accurately determine your tax liability, identify all the deductions and credits you’re entitled to, and work to get you the biggest refund or lowest liability possible.




+ PROFILER® SOFTWARE


We conduct each tax interview on ProFiler, our proprietary tax preparation system with built-in error detection to double-check calculations every step of the way.




+ FREE AUDIT ASSISTANCE


If you receive an audit notice from the IRS, contact your local Jackson Hewitt office immediately and we will appear with you at the audit to explain how your tax return was prepared.
Please note that Jackson Hewitt cannot act as your legal counsel or financial advisor or otherwise represent you in connection with an audit.





+ AMENDED RETURNS


If you find documentation that you think may result in your ability to claim a larger refund or lower your liability after your return was filed this year, last year or the year before, bring it in to Jackson Hewitt. We’ll even review a prior-year return prepared by you or another tax preparation company and then notify you of any missed deductions or credits. For a fee, we’ll then file the amended return for you.




+ FREE ACCURACY GUARANTEE - IT'S OUR BASIC GUARANTEE


All paid Jackson Hewitt tax returns come with our Accuracy Guarantee as a part of your FREE Basic Guarantee coverage. This entitles you to reimbursement of penalties and interest charged by a taxing authority if a Jackson Hewitt tax preparer makes a mistake completing your return.
For an additional fee, you can buy the Gold Guarantee®, and get extra, worry-free coverage.** If you are covered under the Gold Guarantee and a taxing authority notifies you of an error on your return, just contact Jackson Hewitt. After you present your Gold Guarantee certificate, we'll work with you to resolve the issue. The Gold Guarantee may provide you with a reimbursement of any additional tax liability or reduction in your refund amount up to $5,000. All of this coverage is in addition to your coverage under the Basic Guarantee included with every paid tax preparation.
Ask your tax preparer for a copy of the "Commitment to Quality" brochure that explains the terms and conditions of the guarantee.




+ PRODUCT OPTIONS: CHOOSE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR YOU


When you come to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, you're entitled to FREE electronic filing (IRS e-file) with paid income tax preparation. When you e-file at Jackson Hewitt, many additional products and services are available to you.
Benefits of e-filing include:

Acknowledgement from the IRS within 24 hours that your tax return was received
Secure data transfer
Receipt of your refund faster than you would if you mailed your return to the IRS
Convenience - because you don’t need to mail your tax return

Your Jackson Hewitt tax preparer will explain all the product options that are available to you when you e-file, and then you can choose the ones that are right for you.
