Our History
Citizens First Corporation (Company) was incorporated in 1975 for the purpose of conducting business as an investment club. Through the completion of a public offering of its common stock in February 1999, the Company became a registered bank holding company and, in turn, capitalized Citizens First Bank, Inc. (Bank), a de novo commercial bank chartered under the banking laws of the State of Kentucky. The Bank began operations in February 1999 and is the Company’s only operating subsidiary. Along with its headquarters in Bowling Green, the Bank currently operates eight branches in the counties of Warren, Simpson, Barren and Hart in south central Kentucky, and a loan production office in Williamson County, Tennessee.

Personal Loan Services
Whether you are buying a car, making home improvements or simply making one of those purchases you've always wanted, Citizens First offers a broad range of consumer loan products tailored to meet your personal needs.




 
Auto Loan
If you are looking for a new or used vehicle, we provide competitive interest rates and repayment terms to fit your needs.
CD/Savings-Secured Loan
This type of loan allows you to borrow money against your CD or savings account while continuing to earn interest. Using your own funds as collateral usually results in a lower interest rate, and this type of loan is a great way to establish credit.
Line of Credit
This loan is a revolving line of credit that you can borrow from as often as you need up to your approved credit limit. You pay interest only on the amount you borrow.
Cash Reserve
A cash reserve is a line of credit that serves as overdraft protection for your checking account. If you write a check or make a transfer for more than what is available in your checking account, your cash reserve will cover it up to the cash reserve limit and help you avoid non-sufficient funds fees.

When complete, contact the Citizens First branch near you to make an appointment with one of our experienced lenders. All loans subject to credit approval.

BOWLING GREEN, Ky., April 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Citizens First Corporation (NASDAQ:    CZFC) today reported results for the quarter ending March 31, 2016, which include the following:
For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company reported net income of $905,000, or $0.36 per diluted common share.  This represents an increase of $123,000, or $0.07 per diluted common share, from $782,000, or $0.29 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.








"Our first quarter performance continued the trend of improved year-over-year profitability.  EPS, margin, and key credit metrics all showed marked improvement from 2015," said Todd Kanipe, President and CEO of Citizens First.  "Successful execution of our targeted growth strategy has increased the tangible book value of this company and will enable us to continue building capital."
Income Statement
Net interest income increased $201,000, or 5.5%, as the volume of earning assets increased from the prior year.  The Company's net interest margin was 3.94% for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and 3.82% for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 12 basis points from the prior year.  The Company's net interest margin increased due to an increase in the tax-adjusted yield on average earning assets of 7 basis points coupled with a decline in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 4 basis points.
Non-interest income increased $85,000, or 12.3%, primarily due to gain on the sale of securities and an increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans, offset by a decline in lease income.
Non-interest expense increased $167,000, or 5.2%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses, which were a combination of normal salary adjustments and an increase of three full time equivalent employees in the credit division from the prior year.
Credit Quality
Non-performing assets totaled $690,000, or 0.16% of total assets, at March 31, 2016 compared to $1.5 million, or 0.34% of total assets at March 31, 2015, a decrease of $790,000, or 53%. 
The allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2016 was $5.0 million, or 1.53% of total loans, compared to $4.9 million, or 1.49% of total loans as of December 31, 2015. No provision for loan losses was recorded for the first quarter of 2016, and there were net charge-offs (recoveries) of $(128,000) for the first quarter of 2016. We consider the size, volume, and credit quality of the loan portfolio as well as recent economic and other external influences to record the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses that is directionally consistent with our loan portfolio.  
Balance Sheet
Total assets at March 31, 2016 were $434.7 million compared to $432.2 million at December 31, 2015.  Total assets increased $2.5 million, or 0.6%, from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016 due to growth in cash and due from accounts and available for sale securities.  Loans decreased $507,000 during the first quarter of 2016 due to an unplanned payoff and normal reductions in customer lines of credit.   Deposits decreased $7.2 million during the first quarter of 2016 due to a decline in time deposit balances, which were replaced with lower cost FHLB borrowings.
Average assets year-to-date increased 0.7%, or $3.0 million to $433.1 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $430.2 million as of December 31, 2015.  Average loans increased 1.2% to $333.0 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $329.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average deposits increased 0.5% to $367.4 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $365.4 million at December 31, 2015.  
Stockholders' equity increased to $40.4 million at March 31, 2016 from $39.5 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $914,000.  Almost $400,000 in new common equity was created as approximately 5% of the 6.5% cumulative preferred stock converted to common shares.  The tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.70% as of March 31, 2016 compared to 6.43% at December 31, 2015.  The tangible book value per common share improved from $13.97 at December 31, 2015, to $14.43 at March 31, 2016.
Dividend to be paid May 18
On April 21, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.08 per common share payable May 18, 2016 to shareholders of record as of April 29, 2016.  A previous dividend of $.08 per common share was paid in November, 2015.
