November 06, 2014 12:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that Juan R. 
      Luciano has been named the company’s next chief executive officer, 
      effective Jan. 1, 2015. He was also elected to the company’s board of 
      directors, effective immediately. Luciano currently serves as president 
      and chief operating officer responsible for leading and running the 
      company’s global operations.
    


      Luciano will succeed Patricia Woertz, who will continue in the role of 
      ADM’s chairman of the board and is expected to retire in May 2016.
    

      “When I joined ADM in 2006, one of the areas the board asked me to focus 
      on was leadership development and succession planning, with the goal of 
      ensuring an eventual seamless and successful transition to the next 
      CEO,” Woertz said. “As I look ahead to fulfilling a decade of service to 
      the company, the time feels right to begin that succession. ADM’s future 
      is so bright. We have improved the company’s returns and crafted a 
      strategic plan to achieve further improvements. We have worked hard to 
      build the company’s earnings power and now—with good global demand, 
      large global harvests and the expansion of our higher-margin business 
      with the acquisition of WILD Flavors—we are well positioned for greater 
      success.
    

      “The board and I are confident that Juan—supported by ADM’s experienced 
      and dedicated team—is absolutely the right leader to continue ADM’s 
      success,” Woertz said. “He is exceptionally smart and capable, with 
      global perspective and a proven track record of delivering results. I 
      look forward to supporting him in his new role and working to ensure a 
      smooth and seamless transition.”
    

      “I am honored to have the opportunity to lead our great company and team 
      into the future,” Luciano said. “Under Pat’s leadership, we have made 
      exceptional progress creating a high-performance, results-focused 
      company. My commitment is to build on that success by accelerating our 
      pace of progress. This is an exciting time, with tremendous 
      opportunities, and all of us at ADM are committed to leveraging our core 
      model to achieve new levels of value-creation. I look forward to working 
      with my colleagues to extend our more than 100-year record of success.”
    

      Don Felsinger, ADM’s lead independent director, commented on Woertz’s 
      tenure as chief executive officer: “As chairman and CEO for the past 
      eight years, Pat has led the company to become stronger and more 
      disciplined—enhancing its earnings power by leading a focus on returns, 
      optimizing its business portfolio and strengthening its leadership team. 
      With her commitment to excellence and her personal integrity, the 
      company has achieved record financial performance, always with an 
      emphasis on earning the right results, the right way. We congratulate 
      Pat and look forward to her continued advice and perspective as chairman 
      of the board.”
    

      Commenting on the board’s appointment of Luciano as ADM’s next CEO, 
      Felsinger said: “Since joining ADM in 2011, Juan has made an exceptional 
      contribution to the company’s success. His focus on delivering 
      improvements in cost, cash and capital has resonated with investors, and 
      his drive to ensure ADM reaches new levels of customer relevance and 
      excellence ensures that ADM is positioned well for future success. We 
      are confident he will be an outstanding chief executive.”

      into the future,” Luciano said. “Under Pat’s leadership, we have made 
      exceptional progress creating a high-performance, results-focused 
      company. My commitment is to build on that success by accelerating our 
      pace of progress. This is an exciting time, with tremendous 
      opportunities, and all of us at ADM are committed to leveraging our core 
      model to achieve new levels of value-creation. I look forward to working 
      with my colleagues to extend our more than 100-year record of success.”
    

      Don Felsinger, ADM’s lead independent director, commented on Woertz’s 
      tenure as chief executive officer: “As chairman and CEO for the past 
      eight years, Pat has led the company to become stronger and more 
      disciplined—enhancing its earnings power by leading a focus on returns, 
      optimizing its business portfolio and strengthening its leadership team. 
      With her commitment to excellence and her personal integrity, the 
      company has achieved record financial performance, always with an 
      emphasis on earning the right results, the right way. We congratulate 
      Pat and look forward to her continued advice and perspective as chairman 
      of the board.”
    

      Commenting on the board’s appointment of Luciano as ADM’s next CEO, 
      Felsinger said: “Since joining ADM in 2011, Juan has made an exceptional 
      contribution to the company’s success. His focus on delivering 
      improvements in cost, cash and capital has resonated with investors, and 
      his drive to ensure ADM reaches new levels of customer relevance and

ADM's new CEO is a real-life farm boy


Each day when Juan Luciano speaks with his 80-year-old mother, she asks about the price of soybeans at the Chicago Board of Trade. Both have good reason to care about farm commodities. Mr. Luciano spent much of his youth in rural Argentina at his grandfather's Ramallo grain elevator and his nearby family farm, which his mother still owns. Agriculture runs deep in the bloodlines of Mr. Luciano, who yesterday was named CEO of agribusiness conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland Co., the largest company in Illinois based on annual revenue.Mr. Luciano, 53, who got an advanced degree in industrial engineering at a top university in Argentina before immigrating to the United States, will become Chicago-based ADM's first foreign-born CEO when he succeeds Patricia Woertz Jan. 1. He takes over the world's largest corn processor amid a deeper push into foreign markets that includes more investments in food-ingredient businesses and a renewed focus on its boosting production to serve emerging markets like Brazil, China and Eastern Europe. Mr. Luciano joined ADM in 2011 after 25 years at Dow Chemical Co., where he served as president of its performance division. Since his arrival in Decatur, where the company had been based, he has helped lead an effort to expand the company's reach beyond the United States and diversify its product lines. In October, ADM completed the purchase of Wild Flavors GmbH for about $3 billion, the largest acquisition in company history, to gain access to the Swiss firm's scientists and portfolio of natural flavors, seasonings and colors used to enhance processed food and drinks. ADM also is investing in new plants in Decatur, Brazil and China.PROMOTION WAS EXPECTEDMs. Woertz was at the helm of ADM for eight years, seeing the company through a global recession and becoming one of America's longest-tenured female CEOs. She will remain chairman until her retirement in May 2016. Wall Street analysts largely expected the move. “It was well-understood and anticipated,” Ann Duignan, a New York-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an email. Wall Street “is comfortable with him.” Mr. Luciano, who was not made available for an interview, said in a statement that ADM has made “exceptional progress creating a high-performance, results-focused company” under Ms. Woertz's leadership. “My commitment is to build on that success by accelerating our pace of progress.”  He joined ADM in 2011 as executive vice president and chief operating officer. In February, he took on the additional title of president, the company's second-in-command position.
BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB
Away from work, Mr. Luciano is active with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, where he serves as a governor and Midwest chair of the organization's national board of trustees. “He's a champion of champions for kids,” said Jim Clark, the Atlanta-based organization's president CEO who has known Mr. Luciano for about three years. “He takes his role extremely seriously and works tirelessly to make a bigger impact in kids' lives.” Mr. Clark called Mr. Luciano “a quintessential gentleman and a prince of a man” whose leadership ability and passion for helping children shines through in his work for the organization. He said Mr. Luciano is a polished team-builder with a knack for strategy and a magnetic personality. Mr. Luciano also has been an important donor to national and local Boys and Girls Club chapters. “He's the type of person that when he makes a commitment, he delivers. He's not just a name on the letterhead.”Businessman Ronald Gidwitz, a former Illinois gubernatorial candidate and partner at Chicago-based GCG Partners, a consulting and equity firm, also met Mr. Luciano through volunteer work at the Boys and Girls Clubs. He said Mr. Luciano was a major force behind raising money for the charity. He helped organize a fundraising dinner this year in which ADM's Ms. Woertz pledged $1 million to the group. “It was a total surprise to me and everybody,” said Mr. Gidwitz, who described Mr. Luciano as warm and personable. “He's the kind of guy who when you're sitting and talking with him, he's not looking over your shoulder. He's not trying to get an edge. He is genuinely interested in people.” ADM had sales of $89.69 billion in 2013. Shares were trading at $50.55 at midday. The stock hit its 52-week high of $52.36 in mid-September.
