To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 773-4120 or download the file from www.ResourceCreditIncome.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.  Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, mutual funds and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds or preferred shares with the option to convert to equities. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. Regardless of how the fund performs, limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV.

Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance 
      is no guarantee of future results and investment returns and principal 
      value of the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be 
      worth more or less than their original cost. Current 
      performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted 
      above. Performance information is reported net of the Fund’s fees and 
      expenses. The Fund’s gross expenses are 20.65% and net expenses are 
      3.64%. Net fees are based on a contractual fee waiver and reimbursement 
      agreement of 17.01% through at least September 9, 2018. Please review 
      the Fund’s prospectus for more information regarding the Fund’s fees and 
      expenses. Performance and expenses shown are for Class A shares (please 
      see the Fund’s prospectus for information about other share classes). 
      For performance information current to the most recent month-end, please 
      call toll-free (866) 773-4120 or visit www.ResourceCreditIncome.com.


      * To calculate the quarterly distribution, the Fund takes the income 
      received from the Fund’s portfolio, subtracts expenses and divides the 
      result by the total number of shares owned by the Fund’s shareholders. 
      Distributions are not guaranteed.
    

      ** Maximum Offering Price (MOP) for Class A shares includes the Fund’s 
      maximum sales charge of 5.75%.
    

A portion of the distributions consists of a return of capital based 
      on the character of the distributions received from the underlying 
      holdings. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics 
      of all distributions in 2017 will be made after the end of the year. 
      Shareholders should note that a return of capital will reduce the tax 
      basis of their shares and potentially increase the taxable gain, if any, 
      upon disposition of their shares. Resource Alternative Advisor, LLC, the 
      Fund’s investment advisor, and ALPS Distributors, Inc. are not tax 
      experts and do not offer legal or tax advice. It is recommended that 
      shareholders consult with an accountant, tax advisor and/or lawyer. 
      There is no assurance that the Fund will continue to declare 
      distributions or that distributions will continue at these rates. There 
      can be no assurance that any investment by the Fund will be effective in 
      achieving the Fund’s investment objectives, delivering positive returns 
      or avoiding losses.


This distribution policy is subject to change. The Fund may 
      make distributions that are treated as a return of capital. A return of 
      capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you 
      invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital 
      distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment 
      performance and should not be confused with “yield,” “income” or 
      “profit.” The Fund’s distribution amounts were calculated based on the 
      ordinary income received from the underlying investments, including net 
      investment income. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a 
      distribution from the Fund is net profit.


An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges 
      and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a 
      prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 
      773-4120 or download the file from www.ResourceCreditIncome.com. 
      Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.


Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an 
      investment will fluctuate, and a shareholder’s shares, when redeemed, 
      may be worth more or less than their original cost. Certain of the 
      Fund’s underlying investments, including alternative investment funds, 
      exchange-traded funds, interval funds and closed-end funds, are subject 
      to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the 
      Fund. Debt securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. 
      Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal 
      payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, an increase in 
      interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities.

Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund and Resource Credit Income Fund Celebrate Anniversaries | Business Wire
























































Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund and Resource Credit 
      Income Fund Celebrate Anniversaries






March 13, 2017 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Over the next several weeks, two interval funds sponsored by 
      subsidiaries of Resource America, Inc. (“Resource”) will celebrate key 
      milestones, reaching their fourth and second anniversaries, 
      respectively. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, 
      Resource is focused on offering alternative investments that are 
      accessible to retail investors. The interval fund structure has allowed 
      Resource to deliver institutional alternative investment strategies that 
      are typically available only to institutional investors.
    


      On March 12, 2017, Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund (the 
      “Diversified Income Fund”) celebrates its fourth anniversary. The 
      Diversified Income Fund provides an institutional real estate strategy 
      by investing in public and private real estate assets, including both 
      debt and equity instruments. The Diversified Income Fund seeks to offer 
      income, capital appreciation, low volatility, low correlation, and 
      diversification with quarterly liquidity.*
    

      On April 17, 2017, Resource Credit Income Fund (the “Credit Income 
      Fund”) will celebrate its second anniversary. The Credit Income Fund 
      provides access to institutional credit investments, including direct 
      corporate credit, structured credit, traded business development 
      corporations and institutional credit funds. The Credit Income Fund 
      seeks to offer income, capital preservation, low volatility, low 
      correlation, and diversification with quarterly liquidity.*
    

      “I am very proud of the track records our interval funds have built over 
      the years,” says Alan Feldman, Chief Executive Officer of the 
      Diversified Income Fund.
    

      “Five years ago, we looked at the increasingly regulated and challenging 
      investment space and saw a need for accessible alternative investment 
      products. We created the Diversified Income Fund and later the Credit 
      Income Fund to meet this need, and since then, the dramatic growth of 
      the interval fund universe has validated our belief that the interval 
      fund structure can offer investors the access, performance, and 
      flexibility they need.”
    

* No less than 5% of the shares outstanding will be made available 
      for quarterly redemptions. Regardless of how the Fund performs, there is 
      no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares 
      they desire in a quarterly repurchase offer. There is no guarantee that 
      the Fund will achieve its objectives, generate profits, or avoid losses. 
      Diversification does not ensure profit or prevent losses. Distributions 
      are not guaranteed.


The Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund’s primary investment 
      objective is to produce current income, with a secondary objective to 
      achieve long-term capital appreciation with low to moderate volatility 
      and low to moderate correlation to the broader equity markets.


The Resource Credit Income Fund’s investment objectives are to 
      produce current income and achieve capital preservation with moderate 
      volatility and low to moderate correlation to the broader equity markets.

      securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk.

      lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more 
      vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The Fund will 
      not invest in real estate directly, but because the Fund will 
      concentrate its investments in securities of REITs, its portfolio will 
      be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market. 
      There are risks associated with REITs. Risks include declines from 
      deteriorating economic conditions, changes in the value of the 
      underlying properties, and defaults by borrowers. The sales of 
      securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those 
      securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund's NAV.
    

The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc. (ALPS 
      Distributors, Inc. 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203). 
      Resource Real Estate, Inc. and ALPS Distributors, Inc. are not

                    1845 Walnut Street, 18th Floor | Philadelphia, PA 19103                (866) 773-4120 | www.ResourceCreditIncome.com   		     COPYRIGHT © 2017 Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Resource Credit Income Fund is new and has a limited operating history. Although the fund will offer to repurchase at least 5% of outstanding shares on a quarterly basis in accordance with the fund’s repurchase policy, the fund will not be required to repurchase shares at a shareholder’s option nor will shares be exchangeable for units, interests, or shares of any security. An Interval Fund is a continuously offered, closed-end mutual fund that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. This feature allows the Fund greater opportunities to invest in less liquid assets, which may result in higher risk-adjusted returns. Through the interval structure, the Fund offers a Liquidity Feature of quarterly redemptions at NAV of no less than 5% of the shares outstanding made available, redeeming more frequently than other real estate and private equity investments. Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the value of different investment types move in the same direction; if they perform independently of one another, they are non-correlated. Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the underlying value of shares. The NAV of the Fund’s shares is the market value of the Fund’s assets and is the price at which the shares can be purchased before the addition of any applicable sales charges. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 773-4120 or download the file from www.ResourceCreditIncome.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.  Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, mutual funds and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds or preferred shares with the option to convert to equities. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market		  will develop. Regardless of how the fund performs, limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers.	    Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations.  The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV. Senior Loans Risk - Senior loans hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a Borrower. Substantial increases in interest rates may cause an increase in loan defaults as borrowers may lack resources to meet higher debt service requirements. The value of the Fund’s assets may also be affected by other uncertainties such as economic developments affecting the market for senior secured term loans or affecting borrowers generally. Moreover, the security for the Fund’s investments in secured debt may not be recognized for a variety of reasons, including the failure to make required filings by lenders, trustees or other responsible parties and, as a result, the Fund may not have priority over other creditors as anticipated. Structured Products Risk - The Fund may invest in CDOs and other structured products, consisting of CBOs, CLOs and credit-linked notes. Holders of structured products bear risks of the underlying investments, index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk. The Fund may have the right to receive payments only from the structured product, and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer or the entity that sold the assets to be securitized. Private Investment Funds Risk - The Fund’s performance depends in part upon the performance of the Private Investment Fund managers and selected strategies, the adherence by such Private Investment Fund managers to such selected strategies, the instruments used by such Private Investment Fund managers and the Adviser’s ability to select Private Investment Fund managers and strategies and effectively allocate Fund assets among them. The Fund is subject to, and indirectly invests in Private Investment Funds that are subject to, risks associated with legal and regulatory changes applicable to financial institutions generally or to Private Investment Funds in particular. BDC Risk - BDCs may carry risks similar to those of a private equity or venture capital fund. BDC company securities are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value. A BDC is a form of Investment Company that is required to invest at least 70% of its total assets in securities (typically debt) of private companies, thinly traded U.S. public companies, or short-term high quality debt securities. Non-Traded BDC Risk - Non-Traded BDCs are subject to significant commissions, expenses, and offering and organizational costs that reduce the value of an investor’s (including the Fund’s) investment. Non-Traded BDCs are not liquid, and investments in Non-Traded BDCs may not be accessible for an extended period of time. Redemption programs offered by Non-Traded BDCs may have significant restrictions, such as caps on the amount of shares that can be redeemed annually, limits on the amounts and sources of funds that may be used to fund redemptions and the ability of the BDC to suspend or terminate the program at its discretion.

The Resource Credit Income Fund is new and has a limited operating history. Although the fund will offer to repurchase at least 5% of outstanding shares on a quarterly basis in accordance with the fund’s repurchase policy, the fund will not be required to repurchase shares at a shareholder’s option nor will shares be exchangeable for units, interests, or shares of any security. An Interval Fund is a continuously offered, closed-end mutual fund that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. This feature allows the Fund greater opportunities to invest in less liquid assets, which may result in higher risk-adjusted returns. Through the interval structure, the Fund offers a Liquidity Feature of quarterly redemptions at NAV of no less than 5% of the shares outstanding made available, redeeming more frequently than other real estate and private equity investments. Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the value of different investment types move in the same direction; if they perform independently of one another, they are non-correlated. Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the underlying value of shares. The NAV of the Fund’s shares is the market value of the Fund’s assets and is the price at which the shares can be purchased before the addition of any applicable sales charges. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 773-4120 or download the file from www.ResourceCreditIncome.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.  Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, mutual funds and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds or preferred shares with the option to convert to equities. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market		  will develop. Regardless of how the fund performs, limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers.	    Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations.  The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV. Senior Loans Risk - Senior loans hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a Borrower. Substantial increases in interest rates may cause an increase in loan defaults as borrowers may lack resources to meet higher debt service requirements. The value of the Fund’s assets may also be affected by other uncertainties such as economic developments affecting the market for senior secured term loans or affecting borrowers generally. Moreover, the security for the Fund’s investments in secured debt may not be recognized for a variety of reasons, including the failure to make required filings by lenders, trustees or other responsible parties and, as a result, the Fund may not have priority over other creditors as anticipated. Structured Products Risk - The Fund may invest in CDOs and other structured products, consisting of CBOs, CLOs and credit-linked notes. Holders of structured products bear risks of the underlying investments, index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk. The Fund may have the right to receive payments only from the structured product, and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer or the entity that sold the assets to be securitized. Private Investment Funds Risk - The Fund’s performance depends in part upon the performance of the Private Investment Fund managers and selected strategies, the adherence by such Private Investment Fund managers to such selected strategies, the instruments used by such Private Investment Fund managers and the Adviser’s ability to select Private Investment Fund managers and strategies and effectively allocate Fund assets among them. The Fund is subject to, and indirectly invests in Private Investment Funds that are subject to, risks associated with legal and regulatory changes applicable to financial institutions generally or to Private Investment Funds in particular.

The Resource Credit Income Fund is new and has a limited operating history. Although the fund will offer to repurchase at least 5% of outstanding shares on a quarterly basis in accordance with the fund’s repurchase policy, the fund will not be required to repurchase shares at a shareholder’s option nor will shares be exchangeable for units, interests, or shares of any security. An Interval Fund is a continuously offered, closed-end mutual fund that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. This feature allows the Fund greater opportunities to invest in less liquid assets, which may result in higher risk-adjusted returns. Through the interval structure, the Fund offers a Liquidity Feature of quarterly redemptions at NAV of no less than 5% of the shares outstanding made available, redeeming more frequently than other real estate and private equity investments. Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the value of different investment types move in the same direction; if they perform independently of one another, they are non-correlated. Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the underlying value of shares. The NAV of the Fund’s shares is the market value of the Fund’s assets and is the price at which the shares can be purchased before the addition of any applicable sales charges. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call (866) 773-4120 or download the file from www.ResourceCreditIncome.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.  Investing involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, mutual funds and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds or preferred shares with the option to convert to equities. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market		  will develop. Regardless of how the fund performs, limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers.	    Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations.  The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV. Senior Loans Risk - Senior loans hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a Borrower. Substantial increases in interest rates may cause an increase in loan defaults as borrowers may lack resources to meet higher debt service requirements. The value of the Fund’s assets may also be affected by other uncertainties such as economic developments affecting the market for senior secured term loans or affecting borrowers generally. Moreover, the security for the Fund’s investments in secured debt may not be recognized for a variety of reasons, including the failure to make required filings by lenders, trustees or other responsible parties and, as a result, the Fund may not have priority over other creditors as anticipated. Structured Products Risk - The Fund may invest in CDOs and other structured products, consisting of CBOs, CLOs and credit-linked notes. Holders of structured products bear risks of the underlying investments, index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk. The Fund may have the right to receive payments only from the structured product, and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer or the entity that sold the assets to be securitized. Private Investment Funds Risk - The Fund’s performance depends in part upon the performance of the Private Investment Fund managers and selected strategies, the adherence by such Private Investment Fund managers to such selected strategies, the instruments used by such Private Investment Fund managers and the Adviser’s ability to select Private Investment Fund managers and strategies and effectively allocate Fund assets among them. The Fund is subject to, and indirectly invests in Private Investment Funds that are subject to, risks associated with legal and regulatory changes applicable to financial institutions generally or to Private Investment Funds in particular. BDC Risk - BDCs may carry risks similar to those of a private equity or venture capital fund. BDC company securities are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value. A BDC is a form of Investment Company that is required to invest at least 70% of its total assets in securities (typically debt) of private companies, thinly traded U.S. public companies, or short-term high quality debt securities. Non-Traded BDC Risk - Non-Traded BDCs are subject to significant commissions, expenses, and offering and organizational costs that reduce the value of an investor’s (including the Fund’s) investment. Non-Traded BDCs are not liquid, and investments in Non-Traded BDCs may not be accessible for an extended period of time. Redemption programs offered by Non-Traded BDCs may have significant restrictions, such as caps on the amount of shares that can be redeemed annually, limits on the amounts and sources of funds that may be used to fund redemptions and the ability of the BDC to suspend or terminate the program at its discretion.
