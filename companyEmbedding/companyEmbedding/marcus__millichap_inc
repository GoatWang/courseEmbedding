Marcus & Millichap (NYSE: MMI) is a company founded in Palo Alto in 1971 by George M. Marcus that works in the field of commercial real estate, providing real estate brokerage, investment brokerage, research, and advisory services in the U.S. and Canada.[1][2] It is famous in its industry for popularizing the practice of exclusively listing properties with one broker, which by 2015 had become standard practice in the industry.[2][3]
William Millichap was one of the first salespeople Marcus hired, and was made a partner in 1976.[3]
In the early 1990s it participated in the wave of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) vehicles that became publicly traded; it put together Essex Property Trust Inc which went public in 1993[4] and which by 2015 was the biggest apartment landlord on the West Coast.[3][5]
In 2009, New York State investigators investigated the company following charges that Glen Kunofsky, senior vice president of investments, and nine other Marcus & Millichap brokers were accused of acting fraudulently and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The federal charges were dismissed in 2014 following a 3-year investigation.[6][7][8]
In July 2012, a lawsuit filed by Marcus & Millichap in Washington, D.C. against Greysteel Co. LLC, a firm started by a former broker, Ari Firoozabadi, was thrown out, with the judge noting that the firm sought to cause economic harm and ruin their opponents. Marcus & Millichap settled the lawsuit and said they “regret” the lawsuit.[9]
It went public in 2013.[2]
In 2014 the company closed around 7,700 real estate transactions worth around $33 billion, with more closings and more listings than its competitors that year.[5]
In 2015 the company closed 8,715 transactions with a value of approximately $37.8 billion.[10]
In 2016 the company closed 8,995 transactions with a sales volume of approximately $42.3 billion.[11]

Marcus & Millichap (NYSE: MMI) is a company founded in Palo Alto in 1971 by George M. Marcus that works in the field of commercial real estate, providing real estate brokerage, investment brokerage, research, and advisory services in the U.S. and Canada.[1][2] It is famous in its industry for popularizing the practice of exclusively listing properties with one broker, which by 2015 had become standard practice in the industry.[2][3]
William Millichap was one of the first salespeople Marcus hired, and was made a partner in 1976.[3]
In the early 1990s it participated in the wave of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) vehicles that became publicly traded; it put together Essex Property Trust Inc which went public in 1993[4] and which by 2015 was the biggest apartment landlord on the West Coast.[3][5]
In 2009, New York State investigators investigated the company following charges that Glen Kunofsky, senior vice president of investments, and nine other Marcus & Millichap brokers were accused of acting fraudulently and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The federal charges were dismissed in 2014 following a 3-year investigation.[6][7][8]
In July 2012, a lawsuit filed by Marcus & Millichap in Washington, D.C. against Greysteel Co. LLC, a firm started by a former broker, Ari Firoozabadi, was thrown out, with the judge noting that the firm sought to cause economic harm and ruin their opponents. Marcus & Millichap settled the lawsuit and said they “regret” the lawsuit.[9]
It went public in 2013.[2]
In 2014 the company closed around 7,700 real estate transactions worth around $33 billion, with more closings and more listings than its competitors that year.[5]
In 2015 the company closed 8,715 transactions with a value of approximately $37.8 billion.[10]
In 2016 the company closed 8,995 transactions with a sales volume of approximately $42.3 billion.[11]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
