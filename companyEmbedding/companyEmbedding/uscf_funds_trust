History[edit]
United States Commodity Funds LLC is an issuer of exchange traded commodity products (ETPs). It was founded in 2005 in Alameda, CA. The first fund it launched, in 2006, was United States Oil Fund, LP. USO was the first commodity ETF based on crude oil launched in the United States. USO was the fourth commodity ETP launched in the United States, after the SPDR Gold Shares Trust (ticker: GLD), the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ticker: IAU), and the Powershares DB Commodity Index Fund (ticker: DBC).[2] USO is the largest and most actively traded oil-based ETP in the United States.[3]
In 2007, USCF launched United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, the first natural gas based ETP. UNG is the largest and most actively traded natural gas commodity ETP in the United States. USCF also launched the first gasoline based commodity ETP, United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker:UGA), and the first heating oil based commodity ETP, the United States Heating Oil Fund, LP, both in 2008. In 2010, USCF launched the first commodity ETP in the United States that invested in Brent crude oil (ticker:BNO), although previously a Brent crude oil based commodity ETP had been launched in London.[1]
In 2010, USCF launched its first non-energy specific commodity ETP, United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker:USCI), which holds a diversified basket of commodity futures based on the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index ("SDCI"). The SDCI is the first broadly diversified commodity index whose commodity weightings are not fixed, but which instead are adjusted to reflect market conditions.[4]
USCF's commodity exchange traded products are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the merger of the American Stock Exchange with the New York Stock Exchange, all of USCF's products were listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.[1]
On October 6, 2010, commodity index provider SummerHaven Index Management announced that USCF had licensed two new indexes from SummerHaven.[5]
Funds[edit]
The ETPs offered by USCF include eight single commodity funds, each based on an energy related commodity, and three commodity funds based on an indexes licensed by SummerHaven Index Management. The full listing of USCF funds is:

Fund Details
USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund is an exchange traded fund (ETF) designed to capitalize on restaurant companies, one of the fastest growing
industries in the United States1. According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant revenues are forecasted to reach $782.7 Billion in
2016, up about 5% year over year. In an industry that employs over 14.4 million people and serves about 50 million people each day (numbers which
are expected to increase), it is easy to understand how the restaurant industry represents approximately 4% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Smart Beta Methodology – Uses a four-step selection process that includes two quantitative screens and two dynamic screens. The Restaurant
Leaders INDXX Index is rebalanced quarterly.
Definable Investment Solution – May meet the needs for growth investors, sector rotation strategists, and professionals seeking exposure to the restaurant industry.
Transparent and liquid – Holdings are posted each day on the fund’s website. The ETF structure allows investors to trade throughout the day, and use limit, stop, and stop-limit orders.
Investment Objective
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund (NYSE: MENU) seeks to track the price and yield performance
of the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index (iMENU), before fees and expenses.
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund allows investors to access a portfolio of companies in the
restaurant industry, in an easy-to-trade ETF. The Index invests in business franchises that are
leverageable, scalable with high return on capital and which touch millions of people every day.
About the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index
The Index is composed of the common stock of U.S. and international restaurant companies. By using a proprietary Smart Beta four step selection process, the index seeks to identify Restaurant Companies that are outperforming or expected to outperform their industry peers. The Index may include small-, mid-, and large-capitalization companies that trade on a U.S. Exchange and have both a minimum market capitalization of $300 million and an average daily trading volume of $1.5 million. The Index is generally expected to include between 30 and 40 Restaurant Companies and will be rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly in March, June, September, and December. At the time the Index is rebalanced, an initial target weight of 70% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), and an initial target weight of 30% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Full Service Restaurants (FSRs). Given the number of eligible securities, it may not be possible to achieve these target weights in either category, in which case there would not be an exact 70%/30% initially targeted split as described above. Additionally, the Index uses market signals to eliminate some of the securities with the lowest expected future performance and increase the weighting of the largest companies in the Index.  This process could also cause the Index to vary from the 70%/30% initially targeted split between QSRs and FSRs.

*USCF Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") has contractually agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception until October 31, 2017, so that the total annual fund operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, other expenses that are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, extraordinary expenses, if any, and payments, if any, under the Fund’s Rule 12b-1 plan) of the Fund are limited to 0.65% of average daily net assets. Prior to such date, the expense limitation may be terminated only by a vote of the Fund's board of trustees (the "Board"). After such date, the expense limitation may be renewed, terminated or revised by the Adviser, but the Adviser must provide the Board with 90 days' notice of any termination. The Adviser is permitted to recoup from the Fund previously waived advisory fees or reimbursed expenses for three years from the date on which fees were waived or expenses reimbursed, as long as such recoupment does not cause the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses to exceed the expense cap that was applicable during the period in which the fees were waived or expenses were reimbursed.

Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
The Adviser has agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception through October 31, 2017, limiting total annual operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, and other expenses) to 0.65% of the Fund’s average daily net assets. 
The Fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the value of the Fund's total assets less total liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. Share price returns are based on closing prices for the Fund and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

 USCF Funds Trust (Form: FWP, Received: 07/17/2017 06:02:27) 















	 


	 



	Filed Pursuant To Rule 433(f)





	 


	 



	Registration No. 333-214881





	 


	 



	July 17, 2017






	 



	The USCF Funds Trust (the
	“Trust”) has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a Registration Statement on
	Form S-1 (File No. 333-214825) (including a preliminary prospectus therein) with respect to the United States 3x Short Oil
	Fund (the “Fund”), a series of the Trust, for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you
	invest, you should read the preliminary prospectus in that registration statement and other documents that the issuer has
	filed with the SEC for complete information about the Trust and the Fund. You may get these documents for free by visiting
	EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov.


	 


	On March 20, 2017, ETF.com published an interview
	with John Love, the Chief Executive Officer of United States Commodity Funds LLC, the sponsor of the Trust (“USCF”).
	A copy of the interview published on ETF.com is set forth below.

	US Commodity Funds’ Changing Face



	March 20, 2017


	Drew Voros


	 



	United States Commodity Funds is an ETF issuer known
	for commodity products such as the $2.9 billion United States Oil Fund LP (USO) and the $435 million United States
	Natural Gas Fund LP (UNG). Recently, however, the firm expanded its product development focus to include equity funds like the Stock
	Split Index Fund (TOFR) and the USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund (MENU). In addition, the issuer became part of a public
	company in December. ETF.com talked with CEO John Love about some of these changes as well as its bread-and-butter commodity ETFs.




	ETF.com: Let’s talk a little about United States
	Commodity Funds under its new structure, Concierge Technologies [ticker: CNCG]. How did that develop? Was United States Commodity
	Funds actually bought by Concierge Technologies?




	John Love:

	 Effectively, yes. We are 100% owned
	by a company called Wainwright, which is a private company. The majority shareholder was Nick Gerber, who founded the company in
	1995. The USCF entity was formed early last decade, and was the entity through which we launched USO and all of our commodity ETFs.


	Wainwright owns USCF, and so Nick Gerber also acquired
	a public company, became majority shareholder and got control of a public company, which is Concierge. And recently Concierge purchased
	Wainwright, which remains USCF. 


	So there's been no change in control, just a change in
	ownership, really; almost a paperwork thing. But we are now a component of a public company.



	ETF.com: Concierge is a collection of different companies
	that include a food company and a security company. Where’s the synergy with you, an ETF issuer?




	Love:

	 I'm exclusively focused on the USCF level.
	Everything Wainwright and above is Nick. But yes, you're correct; it’s a diverse set of companies. But from a USCF level,
	there's no change in control—still doing what we did before, just different owner of our holding company on paper, but same
	control.








	 



	1



	 







	 





	ETF.com: Generally speaking, USCF is a commodity ETF
	issuer, but your most recent ETFs have been equity ETFs in Stock Split Index Fund (TOFR) and USCF Restaurant Leaders
	Fund (MENU). Is the goal here to veer away from commodities and broaden the lineup?




	Love: 

	That was definitely the thinking behind
	TOFR and MENU. We’re taking a stab at diversifying a little bit. We've certainly been through the commodity route. USO and United
	States Natural Gas Fund LP (UNG) are our biggest funds, and at one time peaked at about $7.5 billion in combined assets.


	They’ve contracted quite a bit because interest in
	those products, and in commodities in general, fell out of favor. Our broad commodity basket fund, the United States Commodity
	Index Fund (USCI), is still doing quite well, but it's not at its all-time high in terms of assets, and we'd like to see that get
	bigger.


	Commodities are where we have expertise. But it might behoove
	us to explore new avenues, and we have the resources and the partners to do a couple things that are in a new space like TOFR and
	MENU. But definitely our focus remains commodities.


	 



	ETF.com: Do you have any other funds in registration?




	Love:

	 We have a mutual fund that's in registration
	that's close to launching. It’s a broad-based commodity fund. In addition, we are working on a Canadian crude oil fund with
	which we've partnered with Auspice Capital in Calgary. We also have an MLP product which with we partnered with REX Shares that’s
	in registration. We've a 3x oil long, and a 3X oil short fund in registration.



	ETF.com: Those oil funds would be your first leveraged/inverse
	funds?




	Love:

	 Correct.



	ETF.com: What are some of the other areas in the commodity
	space you think would work in an ETF wrapper?




	Love:

	 When we first launched USO, there were
	no other oil ETFs in the market, and that was a tremendous advantage. Then pretty much everybody followed with the single-commodity
	ETFs. Not that there's an ETF for every single commodity out there, but as you've seen, some of them are much more successful than
	others.


	I don't know that it makes sense to launch an ETF on every
	single commodity out there, but I think there's still room in the market for innovation and for looking at different ways to potentially
	find the best way to slice a particular commodity or commodities.


	There are areas like our Canadian crude fund that's in
	registration. There's a very interesting story there, in that Canadian crude is very different than West Texas Intermediate or
	Brent crude. It tends to move a lot more on news. There are different fundamentals. That represents opportunity.



	ETF.com: In terms of distribution for your products,
	you're on Schwab's commission-free platforms. Has that been a crucial factor in your distribution?




	Love:

	 It's definitely been beneficial. It's
	not critical to our distribution overall, but it's certainly led to business. It's not just a publicity thing, it's definitely
	a distribution channel that's worthwhile.

 The Dos And Don'ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       The Dos And Don’ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? SETTING UP A TRUST FUND: WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER CONSIDER DOING Parents tend to make mistakes. It kind of goes with the job when you become one. No parent is going to be perfect. This also goes for setting up a trust fund for their kids. There are many parents who have made quite a few mistakes with this. You are here so you can learn from these mistakes. Learn what not to do when setting up a trust.  WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR KID’S TRUST FUNDThis is probably the number one mistake parents make when setting up a trust fund for their kids. They fail to select the appropriate trustee for their kids. There are two different types of trustees. There is the Single trustee. There is also the co-trustee. This one offers more of a checks-and-balances protocol in the system. It really doesn’t matter who you pick, just make sure it’s someone you trust 100% and beyond. What is going to happen once you are no longer there? The trustee can say or go along with anything you want, as long as you are still alive. Once you are dead and gone, this person might just take the reins. This can be both good and bad. Please make sure you are selecting someone you really do have faith in.  THINK ABOUT THE PATH OF THE MONEY This is the second mistake many parents make. They set up a trust. However, they fail to set up a direction for the trust. Guys, you have to do this. Figure out how and when the money should be dispersed out. Do you really want to leave this up to a neutral party? This can and will happen. When it does, you might not be happy with the results. This is your money. These are your kids. Set up some goals.A LIST OF BENEFICIARIES Setting up the trust and the trustee are the first steps. Afterwards, you have to set up a small list of beneficiaries. This way the money goes back and forth where it’s intended to be. You have to have protocols in place to make sure all your plans are happening, as well as people to do the job. You cannot leave this up to chance. Too many parents have left it up to chance. The kids ended up suffering because of it. A trust fund is not just about money. It’s about your kids and their future. Please make sound choices here. Part of providing well for your kids is making good choices with the people involved. Go with your gut. If your gut says to not trust someone with this charge, than listen to it.

Dated November 29, 2016




 

United
States 3x Oil Fund

1,000
Shares

*Principal
U.S. Listing Exchange: TBD.

 

The
United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”), a series of the
USCF Funds Trust, is a fund that issues shares that trade on NYSE
Arca Equities, Inc. (“NYSE”). The investment objective
of the Fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its
shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to
reflect three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of
the price of a specified short-term futures contract on light,
sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.” The Fund seeks a return that is 300% of the return
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day. The Fund
should not be expected to provide 300% of the cumulative return for
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for periods greater than a
day.

 

The Fund
pays its sponsor, United States Commodity Funds LLC
(“USCF”), a limited liability company, a management fee
and incurs certain other costs. The address of both USCF and the
Fund is 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612. The
telephone number for both USCF and the Fund is 510.522.9600. In
order for a hypothetical investment in shares to breakeven over the
next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $25.00 the investment
would have to generate [ • ] % return or $ [
• ] .

The Fund
is an exchange traded fund. This means that most investors who
decide to buy or sell shares of the Fund place their trade orders
through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions
and charges. Shares of the Fund trade on NYSE under the ticker
symbol “ [ • ] ” and are bought and sold
throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other
publicly traded securities.

Shares
will trade on NYSE after they are initially purchased by
“Authorized Participants,” institutional firms that
purchase shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called
“baskets” through the Fund’s marketing agent,
[•] (the “Marketing Agent”). The initial price
per share will be $25, the initial price per basket will be
$1,250,000, and [•] is the initial Authorized Participant.
Thereafter, the price of a basket will be equal to the NAV of
50,000 shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is
accepted by the Marketing Agent. The NAV per share will be
calculated by taking the current market value of the Fund’s
total assets (after close of NYSE) subtracting any liabilities and
dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
Factors that may affect the market value of the Fund, and thereby
the price per share, include, but are not limited to, worldwide and
domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, regulatory
changes, and regulatory fees in the energy sector. Please see below
for additional information. The offering of the Fund’s shares
will be a “best efforts” offering, which means that
neither the Marketing Agent nor any Authorized Participant is
required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount of
shares.

USCF will
pay the Marketing Agent [ • ]. Aggregate compensation paid to
the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for
distribution-related services in connection with this offering of
shares will not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds
of the offering.

 

The Fund
is not appropriate for all investors and presents many different
risks than other types of funds, including risks associated with
the use of leverage. The Fund is intended to be a daily trading
tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks. The
Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that
are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
Additionally, the Fund is designed to achieve its stated investment
objective on a daily basis, but its performance over different
periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily
objective. The Fund is riskier than securities that have
intermediate or long-term investment objectives, and may not be
suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the Fund for a
period other than one day. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period and usually will differ from the 300% of
the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the same
period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns
can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance
during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as
important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Accordingly, the Fund should be
purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the
potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long
investment results. Investors should actively and frequently
monitor their investments in the Fund, even intra-day. It is
possible that you will suffer significant losses in the Fund even
if the long-term performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
is positive.

 

 




 




  

Investors
who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so
at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the
underlying Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts in which the Fund
invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary
trading market for shares. Investing in the Fund involves risks
similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contracts, and other significant risks. See “
Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund ”
beginning on page [5].

The
offering of the Fund’s shares is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in
accordance with the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933
Act”). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering
and is not expected to terminate until all of the registered shares
have been sold or three years from the date of the original
offering, whichever is earlier, unless extended as permitted under
the rules under the 1933 Act, although the offering may be
temporarily suspended if and when no suitable investments for the
Fund are available or practicable. The Fund is not an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under
such Act.

NEITHER
THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR
DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, OR
DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

The Fund
is a commodity pool and USCF is a commodity pool operator subject
to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act
(“CEA”).

   PROSPECTUS
SUMMARY

This is
only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material
information about the Fund and its shares, it does not contain or
summarize all of the information about the Fund and its shares
contained in this prospectus that is material and/or which may be
important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including
“Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund”
beginning on page 5, before making an investment decision about the
shares. For a glossary of defined terms, see Appendix
A.

 

The Fund
is not appropriate for all investors and present different risks
than other types of funds, including risks associated with the
effects of leveraged investing. An investor should only consider an
investment in the Fund if he or she understands the consequences of
seeking daily leveraged investment results. The Fund seeks to
return (before fees and expenses) a multiple (3x) of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day,
not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period and usually will differ from the
Fund’s multiple times the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for the same period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s
investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its
longer-term performance during periods of high volatility.
Volatility may be at least as important to the Fund’s return
for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
The Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day
that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. For example, the return of the Fund for a single day
should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a
fund for a single day with an objective of matching the same
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Shareholders who invest in the
Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as
frequently as daily.

 

  The
Trust and the Fund

 

The USCF
Funds Trust (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust
formed on March 2, 2016. The Trust is a series trust formed
pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (each series, a
“Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”). The
United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”) formed on
[ ·
]
, is a
series of the Trust. The Fund is a commodity pool that continuously
issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased
and sold on NYSE Arca Equities,
Inc. stock exchange (“NYSE”). The Trust and the
Fund operate pursuant to the Trust’s Declaration of Trust and
Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”), dated as of
March 2, 2016. Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company,
is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust and the Fund are
managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited liability company
formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member of
the National Futures Association (“NFA”).


  The
Fund’s Investment Objective and Strategy

 

The
investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in
percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value
(“NAV”) to reflect three times (3x) the daily change in
percentage terms of the price of a specified short-term futures
contract on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.” less the Fund’s expenses. To achieve
this objective, USCF endeavors to have the notional value of the
Fund’s aggregate exposure to the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to
the 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund seeks a return that is
300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a
single day and does not seek to achieve its stated investment
objective over a period of time greater than one day
.

 

The
pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return
of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no
resemblance to 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the
aggregate return of the Fund is the product of the series of each
trading day’s daily returns.

 

  What
Is the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract”?

 

The
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the futures contract on light,
sweet crude oil as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the
“NYMEX”) that is the near month contract to expire,
except when the near month contract is within two weeks of
expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures
contract that is the next month contract to expire.

The Fund
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in
futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude
oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other
petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures
Exchange or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively,
“Oil Futures Contracts”) and to a lesser extent, in
order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market
conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled
options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil,
cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded
(“over-the-counter” or “OTC”) transactions
that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels,
Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing
(collectively, “Other Oil-Related Investments”). Market
conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause the Fund to
invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing the
Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with
more favorable pricing. (For convenience and unless otherwise
specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments
collectively are referred to as “Oil Interests” in this
prospectus.)

The Fund
seeks to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the
daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, less the
Fund’s expenses, will track three times (3x) the daily
changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, also
measured in percentage terms. As a specific benchmark, USCF
endeavors to place the Fund’s trades in Oil Interests and
otherwise manage the Fund’s investments so that the
difference between “A” and “B” will be
plus/minus 0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”,
where:

 




 



•



 



A is the
average daily percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV
for any period of thirty (30) successive valuation days,
i.e. , any NYSE trading day as of which the Fund calculates
its per share NAV, less the Fund’s expenses; and




 




 



•



 



B is three
times the average daily percentage change in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period.




USCF
believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily
changes in the Fund’s share price on NYSE on a percentage
basis, to closely track the daily changes in the Fund’s per
share NAV on a percentage basis. The Fund will not seek to achieve
its stated investment objective over a period of time greater
than one day . The pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals
means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full
trading day may have no resemblance to 300% of the return of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a period of longer than a full
trading day because the aggregate return of the Fund is the product
of the series of each trading day’s daily returns. During
periods of market volatility, the volatility of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract may affect the Fund’s return as much as or
more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
Further, the return for investors that invest for periods less than
a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day
will not be the product of the return of the Fund’s stated
investment objective and the performance of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract for the full trading day. Additionally, investors
should be aware that the Fund’s investment objective is not
for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms,
the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Natural market forces
called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an
investment in the Fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical
direct investment in crude oil and, in the future, it is likely
that the relationship between the market price of the Fund’s
shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil
will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It
is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the
potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude
oil, which could be substantial.)

  Principal
Investment Risks of an Investment in the Fund

 

An
investment in the Fund involves a degree of risk. Some of the risks
you may face are summarized below. A more extensive discussion of
these risks appears beginning on page 5.

Investment
Risk

 

Investors
may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in
crude oil. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the
crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely
fluctuate.

Correlation
Risk

 

To the
extent that investors use the Fund as a means of indirectly
investing in crude oil, there is the risk that the daily changes in
the price of the Fund’s shares on the NYSE on a percentage
basis, will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price
of light, sweet crude oil on a percentage basis. This could happen
if the price of shares traded on the NYSE does not correlate
closely with the value of the Fund’s NAV; the changes in the
Fund’s NAV do not correlate closely with the changes in the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract; or the changes in the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract do not closely
correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil.
This is a risk because if these correlations do not exist, then
investors may not be able to use the Fund as a cost-effective way
to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of
loss in crude oil-related transactions.

 

The price
relationship between the near month contract to expire and the next
month contract to expire that compose the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time
of the Fund’s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total
return tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns.
In cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower
than the next month contract’s price (a situation known as
“contango” in the futures markets), then absent the
impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the
benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches
expiration. In cases in which the near month contract’s price
is higher than the next month contract’s price (a situation
known as “backwardation” in the futures markets), then
absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the
value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches
expiration.

Compounding
Risk

 

The Fund
has a single-day investment objective. Because of daily rebalancing
and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the
return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the
result of each day’s returns compounded over the period,
which will very likely differ from 300% of the return of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period. The Fund may
lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract performance is
flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the
volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the effects of
compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over
time while the level of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
increases.

 

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

 

Tax
Risk

 

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust, in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds.

Over-the-Counter
(“OTC”) Contract Risk

 

The Fund
may also invest in negotiated “OTC” contracts, which
are not as liquid as exchange-traded futures contracts. OTC
contracts expose the Fund to the risk that the Fund’s
counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the
Fund.

Other
Risks

 

The Fund
pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it
is profitable.

Unlike
mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage
their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and
distribute such income and gains to their investors, the Fund
generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other
shareholders. You should not invest in the Fund if you will need
cash distributions from the Fund to pay taxes on your share of
income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for any other
reason.

The Fund
has no operating history, so there is no performance history to
serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the
Fund.

You will
have no rights to participate in the management of the Fund and
will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to manage the
Fund.

The Fund
is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving
USCF, the Marketing Agent, various commodity futures brokers and
Authorized Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and
employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund.
USCF’s personnel are directors, officers or employees of
other entities that may compete with the Fund for their services,
including other commodity pools (funds) that USCF manages (these
funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “Related
Public Funds” and are identified in the Glossary). USCF could
have a conflict between its responsibilities to the Fund and to
those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships,
parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in
a manner other than in the best interest of the Fund and the
shareholders.

  RISK
FACTORS INVOLVED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND

You should
consider carefully the risks described below before making an
investment decision. You should also refer to the other information
included in this prospectus as well as information found in our
periodic reports, which includes the Trust’s and the
Fund’s financial statements and related notes.

  Risks
Related to Leveraged Investments

Due to the
compounding of daily returns, the Fund’s returns over periods
longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly
even direction from the Fund multiple times the benchmark return
for the period.

 

The
investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in
percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect three times (3x)
the daily change in percentage terms of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund seeks investment results for a single day only,
as measured from NAV calculation time to NAV calculation time, and
not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period, and usually will differ from three
times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the
same period. The Fund could lose money over time regardless of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including as a
result of daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract’s volatility, and compounding. Longer holding
periods, higher volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the
Fund’s returns. Daily compounding of the Fund’s
investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its
longer-term performance during periods of high volatility.
Volatility may be at least as important to the Fund’s return
for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

The Fund
uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are
more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. For
example, the return for a single day should be approximately three
times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund with an
objective of matching the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund is not appropriate for all investors and present
different risks than other funds. The Fund uses leverage and is
riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that do
not use leverage. An investor should only consider an investment in
the Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily
leveraged investment results for a single day. Daily objective
leveraged funds, if used properly and in conjunction with the
investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the
markets, can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their
exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing
to monitor and/or periodically rebalance their portfolios.
Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and
monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.

In
general, during periods of higher volatility for the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract, compounding will cause the Fund’s results
for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times
(3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. This
effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases. Conversely,
in periods of lower volatility for the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract (particularly when combined with higher returns for the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract), the Fund’s returns over
longer periods can be higher than three times (3x) the return
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Actual results for a
particular period, before fees and expenses, are also dependent on
the magnitude of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
in addition to the volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

Intraday
Price/Performance Risk.

The Fund
is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its NAV
calculation. As such, the intraday position of the Fund will
generally be different from the Fund’s stated daily
investment objective (i.e., 3x). When shares are bought intraday,
the performance of the Fund’s shares until the Fund’s
next NAV calculation will generally be greater than or less than
the Fund’s stated daily multiple.

The use of
leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an
investor’s investment.

The Fund
utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective
and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its
respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not
employ leverage. The use of leveraged positions could result in the
total loss of an investor’s investment.

For
example, because the investment objective of the Fund is for the
daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect
three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, a single-day movement in the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract approaching 33% at any point in the
day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an
investor’s investment if that movement is contrary to the
investment objective of the Fund, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract subsequently moves in an opposite direction, eliminating
all or a portion of the movement. This would be the case with
downward single-day or intraday movements in the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
maintains a level greater than zero at all times.

  Investment
Risk

 

The NAV
of the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other assets held by the Fund
and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially
adversely affect an investment in the Fund’s shares. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results; all or
substantially all of an investment in the Fund could be
lost.

The net
assets of the Fund consist primarily of investments in Oil Futures
Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Oil-Related
Investments. The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates directly to
the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but
unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of light,
sweet crude oil in the marketplace. Crude oil prices depend on
local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply
and demand for oil.

Economic
conditions impacting crude oil. The
demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic
growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low
or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse
impact on crude oil prices. Other factors that affect general
economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as
changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest,
government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for crude oil. Sovereign
debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or
restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the
European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the
functioning of financial markets and institutions also may
adversely impact the demand for crude oil.

Other
crude oil demand-related factors. Other
factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its
price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency;
seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for crude oil
associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of
alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been
competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or
mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that
alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled
vehicles.

Other
crude oil supply-related factors. Crude oil
prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
For example, increased supply from the development of new oil
supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing
sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply
increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical
manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil. World
oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) production quotas and the occurrence of wars,
hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in
competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of
distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological
change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the
petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to
manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of
and demand for oil.

Other
factors impacting the crude oil market. The
supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes
in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market
conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy
sources.

Price
Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your
Investment. Futures
contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject
to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you
could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the
Fund.

  Correlation
Risk

Investors
purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude
oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay
for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil.
Investing in the Fund’s shares for hedging purposes involves
the following risks:

 




 



•



 



The market
price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be
significantly less or more than NAV.




 




 



•



 



Daily
percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily
percentage changes, on a leveraged basis in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




 




 



•



 



Daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in
the price of light, sweet crude oil.




 

 




 



6



 




  

Further,
in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, the Fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios
daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives.
Being materially under- or overexposed to the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may prevent the Fund from achieving a high degree of
correlation with the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Market
disruptions or closures, large amounts of assets into or out of the
Fund, regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility will
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to adjust exposure to
requisite levels. The target amount of portfolio exposure is
impacted dynamically by the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
movements during each day. Because of this, it is unlikely that the
Fund will be perfectly exposed (i.e., 3x) at the end of each day,
and the likelihood of being materially under- or overexposed is
higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the
close of the trading day.

In
addition, unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios
as frequently, the Fund may be subject to increased trading costs
associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain
appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks. Such costs
include commissions paid to the FCMs, and may vary by
FCM.

The market
price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly
less or more than NAV.

The
Fund’s NAV per share will change throughout the day as
fluctuations occur in the market value of the Fund’s
portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an
investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may
be different from the NAV of the shares. Price differences may
relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the
secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to,
but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the
light, sweet crude oil and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at
any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain
arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their
clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price
to track NAV per Share closely over time, but there can be no
assurance of that.

The NAV of
the Fund’s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent
trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures
exchanges on which crude oil is traded. While the shares trade on
the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading
hours for the futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil
trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time. For
example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Time, liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will
be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the
futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil is traded are
closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on
the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference
between the price of the shares and the NAV of the
shares.

Daily
percentage changes in the Fund’s NAV may not correlate with
daily percentage changes, on a leveraged basis, in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

It is
possible that the daily percentage changes in the Fund’s NAV
per share may not closely correlate, on a leveraged basis, to daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the
market for light, sweet crude oil, the imposition of position or
accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other
extraordinary circumstances. As the Fund approaches or reaches
position limits with respect to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
and other Oil Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions,
the Fund may begin investing in Other Oil-Related Investments. In
addition, the Fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in
the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract because the total
return generated by the Fund is reduced by expenses and transaction
costs, including those incurred in connection with the Fund’s
trading activities, and increased by interest income from the
Fund’s holdings of Treasuries (defined below). Tracking the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract requires trading of the Fund’s
portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its
trading principals, among other factors.

Daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the
spot price of light, sweet crude oil.

The
correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only
approximate. The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon
circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market,
supply of and demand for Oil Futures Contracts (including the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract) and Other Oil-Related Investments,
and technical influences in oil futures trading.

Natural
forces in the oil futures market known as
“backwardation” and “contango” may increase
the Fund’s tracking error and/or negatively impact total
return.

The design
of the Fund’s Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is such that
every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire
until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration,
when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month
contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that
contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract
and close to expiration. In the event of a crude oil futures market
where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month
to expire contracts, a situation described as
“backwardation” in the futures market, then absent the
impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the
benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
Conversely, in the event of a crude oil futures market where near
month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a
situation described as “contango” in the futures
market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil
prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as
it approaches expiration. When compared to total return of other
price indices, such as the spot price of crude oil, the impact of
backwardation and contango may cause the total return of the
Fund’s per share NAV to vary significantly. Moreover, absent
the impact of rising or falling oil prices, a prolonged period of
contango could have a significant negative impact on the
Fund’s per Share NAV and total return and investors could
lose part or all of their investment. See “Additional
Information About the Fund, its Investment Objective and
Investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of
contango and backwardation.

Accountability
levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by
the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which
could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

Designated
contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have
established accountability levels and position limits on the
maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity
interests that any person or group of persons under common
trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by the
Fund is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position
limits apply to the futures contracts that the Fund invests in to
meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels
and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price
fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price
fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of
a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous
day’s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation
limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades
may be made at a price beyond that limit.

The CFTC
has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28
physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are
economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture,
energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances
under which market participants would be required to aggregate
their positions with other persons under common ownership or
control, the Position Limit Rules. The Position Limit Rules, as
proposed, would apply to the futures contracts that the Fund
invests in to meet its investment objective. The Position Limit
Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are
subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that
restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold
in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create
an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging
transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish
position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules;
and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues:
OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The
CFTC’s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules,
in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012
and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited
comments from market participants multiple times.

Until such
time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory
architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit
Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related
derivatives (collectively, “Referenced Contracts”).
Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation
in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures
exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for
agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural
gas). As a result, the Fund may be limited with respect to the size
of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit
Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits,
of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single
entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position
existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in
cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC’s existing
position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market
participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for
which that participant controls the trading decisions with all
positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater
ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the
positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or
implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how
the Position Limit Rules may affect the Fund, but the effect may be
substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit
Rules may negatively impact the ability of the Fund to meet its
investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF’s
ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund.

All of
these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the
price of the Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract. This may in turn prevent investors from being
able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against crude
oil-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude
oil.

The Fund
has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to
utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Oil Futures
Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments. If the Fund encounters
accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits
for Oil Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then,
if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Oil
Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil
futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its
investment objective. In addition, if the Fund exceeds
accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is
required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction
could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the
Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

 

  Tax
Risk

 

An
investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of
distributions, if any, on its shares.

 

Cash or
property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF
does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with
respect to shares. Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal
income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax,
on their allocable share of the Fund’s taxable income,
without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount
of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability of an investor
with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or
value of property (if any) distributed.

 

An
investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may
differ from its economic income or loss on its
shares.

 

Due to
the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the
Fund in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an
investor’s allocable share of the Fund’s income, gain,
deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss
from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be
temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being
taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.

Items of
income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares
could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after
December 31, 2017, the Fund could be liable for U.S. federal income
tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does
not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the Fund in
allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an
investor.

 

The U.S.
tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex
and their application to large, publicly traded entities such as
the Fund is in many respects uncertain. The Fund applies certain
assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent
of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains,
deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects
shareholders’ economic gains and losses. These assumptions
and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the
Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and applicable
Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will
successfully challenge the Fund’s allocation methods and
require the Fund to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors. If
this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax
return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency
interest.

 

In
addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Fund
may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any “imputed
understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a
result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed understatement
generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or
gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of
deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for
any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or
gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of
deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If the Fund is required
to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement,
the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the Fund
and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares.
Under certain circumstances, the Fund may be eligible to make an
election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of
any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties.
The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Fund to
make this election is uncertain. If the election is made, the Fund
would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial
interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted
allocations relate with a statement setting forth their
proportionate shares of the adjustment (“Adjusted
K-1s”). The investors would be required to take the
adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted
K-1s are issued. The resulting tax liability on an investor of
taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the
Adjusted K-1 is issued may be less favorable to the investor than
if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed
year.

The Fund
could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes,
which may substantially reduce the value of the
shares.

 

The
Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has received an opinion of counsel
that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, the Fund will be
treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least
90 percent of the Fund’s annual gross income consists of
“qualifying income” as defined in the Code,
(ii) the Trust and the Fund is organized and operated in
accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and
(iii) the Trust and the Fund does not elect to be taxed as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although USCF
anticipates that the Fund will satisfy the “qualifying
income” requirement for all of its taxable years, that result
cannot be assured. The Fund has not requested and nor will the Fund
request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification
as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Fund
is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any
taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses
and deductions proportionately to shareholders, the Fund would be
subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax
rates. In addition, although the Fund currently does not intend to
make any distributions with respect to the Shares any distributions
would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income to the extent
of the Fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits.
Subject to holding period and other requirements, any such dividend
would be a qualifying dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax
at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to long-term capital
gains. Taxation of the Trust and the Fund as a corporation could
materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares
and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds.

 

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds. No U.S. federal income tax is paid by
the Fund on its income. Instead, the Fund will furnish shareholders
each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and
each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal
income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and
deduction of the Fund. This must be reported without regard to the
amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a
distribution from the Fund during the taxable year. A shareholder,
therefore, may be allocated income or gain by the Fund but receive
no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting
from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is
insufficient to pay such liability.

In
addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to
other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated
business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or
intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions
in which the Fund does business or owns property or where the
shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those various taxes is
not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider
their potential impact on its investment in the Fund. It is each
shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.

 

If the
Fund is required to withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S.
shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all
shareholders.

Under
certain circumstances, the Fund may be required to pay withholding
tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders. Although
the Trust Agreement provides that any such withholding will be
treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, the Fund
may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to
be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts
were withheld since the Fund does not intend to make any
distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the
withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the
shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could
have a material impact on the value of the shares.

 

  OTC
Contract Risk

 

Currently,
OTC transactions are subject to changing
regulation.

 

A portion
of the Fund’s assets may be used to trade OTC contracts, such
as forward contracts, options, swaps or spot contracts. OTC
contracts are typically contracts traded on a
principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets
that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and
other institutions. The markets for OTC contracts rely upon the
integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional
regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures
markets. While certain regulations adopted over the past several
years are intended to provide additional protections to
participants in the OTC market, the current regulation of the OTC
contracts could expose the Fund in certain circumstances to
significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial
failure by participants. As a result of such regulations, if the
Trust on behalf of the Fund, enters into or has entered into
certain interest rate and credit default swaps, such swaps will be
required to be centrally cleared. Determinations on other types of
swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could
require the Fund to centrally clear certain OTC instruments
presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral
basis.

 

 




 



10



 




  

The Fund
will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to
OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of the Fund or
held by special purpose or structured vehicles.

 

The Fund
faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC
contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these
contracts is generally a single bank or other financial
institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group
of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater
counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may
not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund, in which case the
Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts.

If a
counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its
obligations due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience
significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or
other reorganization proceeding. The Trust on behalf of the Fund
may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such
circumstances.

Valuing
OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial
instruments.

 

In
general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing
actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded
futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price
and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be
terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms
may not reflect the best price or terms available from other
sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally
quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating
OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do
so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a
result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an
outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.

 

  Compounding
Risk

The Fund
has a single-day investment objective, and the Fund’s
performance for periods greater than a single day will be the
result of each day’s returns compounded over the period,
which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract times the stated multiple in
the Fund’s investment objective, before accounting for fees
and fund expenses. Compounding affects all investments, but it has
a more significant effect on an a leveraged fund. Particularly
during periods of higher Benchmark Oil Futures Contract volatility,
compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single day
to vary from three times (3x) of the return of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract. This effect becomes more pronounced as volatility
increases. Fund performance for periods greater than a single day
will be affected by the following factors: (i) Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract volatility, (ii) Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
performance, (iii) period of time, (iv) financing rates associated
with exposure and (v) other Fund expenses.

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

  Other
Risks

NYSE may
halt trading in the Fund’s shares, which would adversely
impact an investor’s ability to sell
shares.

The
Fund’s shares are listed for trading on NYSE under the market
symbol “[ • ].” Trading in shares may be halted
due to market conditions or, in light NYSE rules and procedures,
for reasons that, in the view of NYSE, make trading in shares
inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts
caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to
“circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be
halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements
necessary to maintain the listing of the Fund’s shares will
continue to be met or will remain unchanged.

The lack
of an active trading market for the Fund shares may result in
losses on an investor’s investment in the Fund at the time
the investor sells the shares.

Although
the Fund’s shares are listed and traded on NYSE, there can be
no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be
maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no
active trading market for them exists, the price the investor
receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be
sold, likely would be lower than if an active market
existed.

Certain of
the Fund’s investments could be illiquid, which could cause
large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
 

Futures
positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is
difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a
relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A
market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political
actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil
production or exports, or another major export, can also make it
difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Oil Futures
Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments may be illiquid, the
Fund’s Oil Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at
favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be
incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
The large size of the positions that the Fund may acquire increases
the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult
to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to
do so.

OTC
contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less
marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an
exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered
into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the
availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general,
they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized
futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could
adversely impact the Fund’s ability to realize the full value
of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to
reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC
transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a
counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a
party’s exposure on the transaction in such
situations.

The Fund
is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is
rising.

The Fund
is not actively managed by conventional methods. Accordingly, if
the Fund’s investments in Oil Interests are declining in
value, the Fund will not close out such positions except in
connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant
upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in
connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. USCF will seek to cause the NAV of the Fund’s
shares to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract during periods
in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price
is rising.

Regulation
of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and
constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible
to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the
Fund.

The
futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations,
and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures
exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event
of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive
implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin
requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the
suspension of trading. Regulation of commodity interest
transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law
and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial
action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on
non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in
the United States. In addition, various national governments
outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the
disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and
the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect
of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to
predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.

An
investment in the Fund may provide little or no diversification
benefits. Thus, in a declining market, the Fund may have no gains
to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer
losses on an investment in the Fund while incurring losses with
respect to other asset classes.

Historically,
Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments have
generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset
classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there
is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance
of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one
hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.

However,
there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue
during future periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, the
Fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction
as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no
diversification benefits from an investment in the Fund’s
shares. In such a case, the Fund may have no gains to offset losses
from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their
investment in the Fund at the same time they incur losses with
respect to other investments.

Variables
such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other
political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and
crude oil-linked instruments, including Oil Futures Contracts and
Other Oil-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
These additional variables may create additional investment risks
that subject the Fund’s investments to greater volatility
than investments in traditional securities.

Non-correlation
should not be confused with negative correlation, where the
performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
There is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil
and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are
negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, the
Fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during
unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.

Trading in
international markets could expose the Fund to credit and
regulatory risk.

 The
Fund invests primarily in Oil Futures Contracts, a significant
portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including
the NYMEX. However, a portion of the Fund’s trades may take
place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Some
non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the
same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. Trading on
such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are
not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S.
counterparts, including potentially different or diminished
investor protections. In trading contracts denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Fund is subject to the risk
of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the
functional currencies of such contracts. Additionally, trading on
non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange
controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to
local economic declines and political instability. An adverse
development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the
profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected
international markets.

USCF is
leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage the
Fund and other funds.

 

USCF was
formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as
the Fund and has been managing such investment vehicles since April
2006. The Chief Executive Officer and President of USCF manage and
direct the day-to-day activities and affairs of the
Fund.

The Sixth
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USCF
(the “LLC Agreement”) provides limited authority to the
Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed
by USCF’s parent company, which is a closely-held private
company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by
one person.

 

USCF’s
Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors,
each of whom are shareholders of USCF’s parent, Wainwright
Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”), and three Non-Management
Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of
applicable exchange and SEC rules. Under USCF’s LLC
Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as
the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means
that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to
control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically
the case with the independent members of a company’s Board of
Directors. In addition, any Director may be removed by written
consent of Wainwright, which is the sole member of USCF. Wainwright
is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are
held by or on behalf of Nicholas D. Gerber and his immediate family
members (the “Gerber Family”). Historically, shares of
Wainwright have been voted by, and on behalf of, the Gerber Family
by Nicholas D. Gerber, and it is anticipated that such trend will
continue in the future. Accordingly, although USCF is governed by
the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management
Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC
Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his
control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director
(including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit
Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF
and the Fund, including their regulatory obligations.

There is a
risk that the Fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to
compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such
the Fund may not earn any profit.

 

The Fund
is contractually obligated to pay a management fee to USCF, fees to
brokers subject to a cap, and certain expenses regardless of
whether the Fund’s activities are profitable. Accordingly,
the Fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these
fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.

Regulation
of the commodity interests markets is extensive and constantly
changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict
but may significantly and adversely affect the
Fund.

 

The

and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures
exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event
of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive

markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in
general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is
impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and
adverse.

The Trust
is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have
the protections of the 1940 Act.

 

The Trust
is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that
statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have
a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the
relationship between the investment company and its investment
manager.

 

The Fund
has no operating history so there is no performance history to
serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the
Fund.

 

The Fund
is new and has no operating history. Therefore, you do not have the
benefit of reviewing the past performance of the Fund as a basis to
evaluate an investment in the Fund. The Sponsor’s current
experience involves managing the Related Public Funds. The
Sponsor’s results with the Related Public Funds may not be
directly applicable to the Fund since the Fund has a different
investment objective than the Related Public Funds.

The Fund
and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to
favor their own interests to the detriment of
shareholders.

 

The Fund
is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving
USCF, various commodity futures brokers, the Marketing Agent and
any Authorized Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and
employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. These
persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that
may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a
conflict between their responsibilities to the Fund and to those
other entities. As a result of these and other relationships,
parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in
a manner other than in the best interests of the Fund and the
shareholders. USCF has not established any formal procedure to
resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are
dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to
such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF
attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in
fact, result in adverse consequences to the
shareholders.

The Fund
may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its
Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”), including, but not
limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of
compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or
competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded
through the FCM.

USCF’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their
responsibilities to the Fund and to the Related Public
Funds.

 

The Fund
and USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to
maintain the Fund’s asset size in order to preserve its fee
income and this may not always be consistent with the Fund’s
objective of having the value of its shares’ NAV track, on a
leveraged basis, changes in the value of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contracts.

USCF’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund. For example, USCF’s directors,
officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities,
including the Related Public Funds, that may compete with the Fund
for their services. Accordingly, they could have a conflict between
their responsibilities to the Fund and to other
entities.

USCF has
sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of
the Fund. This authority to manage the investments and operations
of the Fund may allow USCF to act in a way that furthers its own
interests in conflict with the best interests of investors.
Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit the
ability to influence matters such as amending the Trust Agreement,
changing the Fund’s basic investment objective, dissolving
the Fund, or selling or distributing the Fund’s
assets.

favor its own interests to the detriment of Fund
shareholders.

REX may
have conflicts of interest, which may permit it to favor its own
interests to the detriment of shareholders. REX’s officers,

responsibilities to the Fund and to those other entities. As a
result of these and other relationships, parties involved with REX
may have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the
best interests of the Fund and the shareholders. USCF has not
established any formal procedure to resolve REX conflicts of
interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith
of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to
resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these
conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF
to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse
consequences to the Fund’s shareholders.

REX’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their
responsibilities to other entities.

REX’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund. Rather, REX’s directors, officers
and employees act in various capacities for other entities, some of
which may now, or in the future, compete with the Fund for their
services. Accordingly, REX’s officers, directors and
employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to
the Fund and to other entities.

USCF has
sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of
the Fund. It has delegated certain marketing functions with respect
to the Fund to REX. REX may act in a way that furthers its own
interests in conflict with the best interests of
investors.

 

Shareholders
have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace
USCF only under specific circumstances. Shareholders do not
participate in the management of the Fund and do not control USCF,
so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect
the Fund.

 

Shareholders
have very limited voting rights with respect to the Fund’s
affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated
with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for
example, the right to bring “oppression” or
“derivative” actions). Shareholders may elect a
replacement sponsor only if USCF resigns voluntarily or loses its
charter. Shareholders are not permitted to participate in the
management or control of the Fund or the conduct of its business.
Shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of
USCF to manage the Fund’s affairs. For example, the
dissolution or resignation of USCF would cause the Fund to
terminate unless, within 90 days of the event, shareholders holding
shares representing at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of
the Fund elect to continue the Trust and appoint a successor
sponsor. In addition, USCF may terminate the Fund if it determines
that the Fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its
operating expenses make the continued operation of the Fund
unreasonable or imprudent. However, no level of losses will require
USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s termination would
result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the
proceeds thereof, first to creditors and then to the shareholders
in accordance with their positive book capital account balances,
after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and
allocations for all periods, and the Fund could incur losses in
liquidating its assets in connection with a termination.

The Fund
could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential
loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall
maturity and timing of an investor’s investment
portfolio.

 

The Fund
could terminate at any time, regardless of whether that the Fund
has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement.
In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the bankruptcy,
dissolution, or removal of USCF as the sponsor of the Trust could
cause the Fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in
accordance with the Trust Agreement. However, no level of losses
will require USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s
termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an
investor’s investment. Termination could also negatively
affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s
investment portfolio.

An
unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period
of time could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
NAV.

 

If a
substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets
are received by the Fund during a relatively short period of time,
the Fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the Fund
assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be
necessary to liquidate positions in the Fund’s trading
positions before the time that the trading strategies would
otherwise dictate liquidation.

The Fund
does not expect to make cash distributions.

 

The Fund
does not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to
reinvest any realized gains in additional Oil Interests rather than
distributing cash to shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds,
commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage
their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from
their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to
their investors, the Fund generally does not expect to distribute
cash to shareholders. An investor should not invest in the Fund if
the investor will need cash distributions from the Fund to pay
taxes on its share of income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for
any other reason. Nonetheless, although the Fund does not intend to
make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments
held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit
distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not
necessary to support its underlying investments in Oil Interests
and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without
receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this
income becomes significant then cash distributions may be
made.

 

Proposed
Money Market Reform

 

Currently,
the Fund may invest in money market funds, as well as Treasuries
with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for
assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted final rules governing the
structure and operation of money market funds, in a release
adopting amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The new rules
will require institutional prime money market funds to price their
shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost
method ( i.e. , to use a “floating NAV”). In
addition, all money market funds will be able, and in certain cases
will be required, to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend
redemptions during periods of market stress, subject to certain
board findings. The SEC also revised certain diversification
provisions of Rule 2a-7, as well as provisions relating to stress
testing. Compliance with these requirements is not currently
required. Accordingly, it is unclear at this time what impact of
money market reform would have on the Fund’s ability to hedge
risk. However, the imposition of a floating NAV could cause the
Fund to limit remaining assets solely in Treasuries and
cash.

The
failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or the Fund’s
Custodian could result in a substantial loss of the Fund’s
assets and could impair the Fund in its ability to execute
trades.

 

Under
CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers’
assets in a bulk segregated account. If a clearing broker fails to
do so, or even if the customers’ funds are segregated by the
clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a
substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing
broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a
substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing
broker’s bankruptcy. In that event, the clearing
broker’s customers, such as the Fund, are entitled to
recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to
them, only a proportional share of all property available for
distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers. The
bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the loss of the
Fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker. The Fund may
also be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in
performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing
organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are
traded.

In
addition, to the extent the Fund’s clearing broker is
required to post the Fund’s assets as margin to a
clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account
containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers.
If the Fund’s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse
because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other
customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of
the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by the
Fund and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker
to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.

From time
to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory
proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. A clearing
broker’s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal
proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from
the clearing broker’s trading operations, which could impair
the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute and
clear the Fund’s trades.

In
addition, the majority of the Fund’s assets are held in
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with [ • ] (the
“Custodian”). The insolvency of the Custodian could
result in a loss of the Fund’s assets held by the Custodian,
which, at any given time, could comprise a substantial portion of
the Fund’s total assets.

The
liability of USCF and the Trustee are limited under the Trust
Agreement, and the value of the shares will be adversely affected
if the Fund is required to indemnify the Trustee or
USCF.

 

Under the
Trust Agreement, the Trustee and USCF are not liable, and have the
right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense incurred
absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Trustee or USCF or breach by USCF of the Trust Agreement, as the
case may be. As a result, USCF may require the assets of the Fund
to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or
by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the
Fund and the value of its shares.

Although
the shares of the Fund are limited liability investments, certain
circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the Fund by
a shareholder will increase the shareholder’s
liability.

 

The
shares of the Fund are limited liability investments; shareholders
may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits
recognized on their investment. However, shareholders could be
required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of
the Fund any distribution they received at a time when the Fund was
in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In
addition, a number of states do not have “statutory
trust” statutes such as the Delaware statutes under which the
Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible that
a court in such state could hold that, due to the absence of any
statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the
shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same
limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private
corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware, are not so entitled in such state. Finally, in the event
the Trust or the Fund is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand
or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a
result of or in connection with any shareholder’s (or
assignee’s) obligations or liabilities unrelated to the
business of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, such shareholder
(or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement
to indemnify the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, for all such
liability and expense incurred, including attorneys’ and
accountants’ fees.

Investors
cannot be assured of REX’s continued services, and
discontinuance may be detrimental to the Fund.

 

Investors
cannot be assured that REX will be willing or able to continue to
service the Fund for any length of time. If REX discontinues its
activities on behalf of the Fund, the Fund may be adversely
affected.

 

The Fund
is a series of the Trust and, as a result, a court could
potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the Fund
are not segregated from those of another series of the Trust,
thereby potentially exposing assets in the Fund to the liabilities
of another series of the Trust.

 

The Fund
is a series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate
legal entity. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if
certain provisions are included in the formation and governing
documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate
and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets
associated with that series are held in separate and distinct
records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records
separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any
series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and
expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against
the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the
statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely,
none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred
with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable
against the assets of such series. USCF is not aware of any court
case that has interpreted this Inter-Series Limitation on Liability
or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance.
USCF intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the Fund
and account for the Fund separately from any other series of the
Trust, but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods
used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would
potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of
another series of the Trust.

USCF and
the Trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or
other proceeding in respect of the Fund
property.

 

Neither
USCF nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its
respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other
proceeding in respect of the Fund property. The Trust Agreement
does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such
action, suit or other proceeding.

Third
parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual
property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise
violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in
significant costs and diverted attention.

 

It is
possible that third parties might utilize the Fund’s
intellectual property or technology, including the use of its
business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without
permission. USCF has a patent for the Fund’s business method
and has registered its trademarks. The Fund does not currently have
any proprietary software. However, if it obtains proprietary
software in the future, any unauthorized use of the Fund’s
proprietary software and other technology could also adversely
affect its competitive advantage. The Fund may not have adequate
resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses
of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other
technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business
methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology
similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their
intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark
rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result,
USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade
secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties’
proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has
infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights, or
defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid. Any
litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless
of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its
resources from the Fund, or require it to change its proprietary
software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing
agreements.

Due to the
increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional
cyber-attacks pose operational and information security
risks.  

With the
increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the
dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business
functions, the Fund is susceptible to operational and information
security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from
deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber-attacks include,
but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital
systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive
information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not
require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing
denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or
breaches of the Fund’s clearing broker or third party service
provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the
administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability
to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially
resulting in financial losses, the inability of Fund shareholders
to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other
laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional
compliance costs.

In
addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any
cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its shareholders could
be negatively impacted as a result. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such
plans.

 


  ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND, ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND
INVESTMENTS

The Fund
is a series of the Trust. The Trust operates pursuant to the terms
of the Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of March
2, 2016 (“Trust Agreement”) which grants full
management control of the Fund to USCF. The Trust Agreement is
posted on the Fund’s website at [ • ] . The Fund
maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street,
Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.

The net
assets of the Fund consist primarily of investments in the Oil
Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments. Market
conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause the Fund to
invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing the
Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with
more favorable pricing.

The Fund
invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in futures
contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts
of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these
obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two
years or less (“Treasuries”), cash and cash
equivalents. The daily holdings of the Fund are available on the
Fund’s website at [ • ] .

The Fund
invests in Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without
being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or
collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Oil
Interests. In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF is
the investment in futures contracts and the management of the
Fund’s investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash
equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral.

The Fund
seeks to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the
daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will track
three times (3x) the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms. As a
specific benchmark, USCF endeavors to place the Fund’s trades
in Oil Interests and otherwise manage the Fund’s investments
so that the difference between “A” and “B”
will be plus/minus 0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”,
where:

 




 



•



 



A is the
average daily percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV
for any period of thirty (30) successive valuation days,
i.e. , any NYSE trading day as of which the Fund calculates
its per share NAV; and




 




 



•



 



B is three
times the average daily percentage change in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same
period.   




USCF
believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily
change in the Fund’s share price on the NYSE exchange on a
percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the
Fund’s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further
believes that the daily changes in the Fund’s NAV in
percentage terms will track three times (3x) the daily changes in
percentage terms in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less the
Fund’s expenses.

The Fund
will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a
period of time greater than one day . The pursuit of daily
leveraged investment goals means that the return of the Fund for a
period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to
300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for such
longer period because the aggregate return of the Fund is the
product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns.
During periods of market volatility, the volatility of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract may affect the Fund’s return
as much as or more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. Further, the return for investors that invest for periods
less than a full trading day or for a period different than a
trading day will not be the product of the return of the
Fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the full trading day.
Additionally, investors should be aware that the Fund’s
investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares
to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude
oil. Natural market forces called contango and backwardation can
impact the total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares
relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in
the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market
price of the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of
light, sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango
and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure
above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning
and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

  

The
Fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed
to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the Fund’s
shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a
cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the oil or
other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude
oil-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment
objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated
with investing in crude oil and/or the risks involved in hedging
may exist. In addition, an investment in the Fund involves the risk
that the daily changes in the price of the Fund’s shares, in
percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract on a leveraged basis, in
percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract in percentage terms, will not closely correlate
with daily changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil, in
percentage terms.

  Impact
of Contango and Backwardation on Total Returns

Natural
market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the
total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares relative
to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in the
future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price
of the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light,
sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and
backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above
ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and
storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)

Several
factors determine the total return from investing in a futures
contract position. One factor that impacts the total return that
will result from investing in near month futures contracts and
“rolling” those contracts forward each month is the
price relationship between the current near month contract and the
next month contract. For example, if the price of the near month
contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation
referred to as “backwardation” in the futures market),
then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a
next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month
contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a
near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a
situation referred to as “contango” in the futures
market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the
price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes
the near month contract and approaches expiration.

As an
example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery
(the “spot” price), was $50 per barrel, and the value
of a position in the near month futures contract was also $50. Over
time, the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on
a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to
its supply. The value of the near month contract will likewise
fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If investors
seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not
take delivery of the oil, every month they must sell their current
near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the
next month contract.

If the
futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of crude
oil futures contracts that expire later than the near month
contract are lower than the near month contract’s price, the
investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price
than the current near month contract. Using the $50 per barrel
price above to represent the front month price, the price of the
next month contract could be $49 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper
than the front month contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no
other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price
relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and
the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission
costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the
value of the $49 next month contract would rise as it approaches
expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of
$50. In this example, the value of an investment in the second
month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of
crude oil, or fall slower. As a result, it would be possible in
this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have
risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the
investment in the second month futures contract would have risen
12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has
elapsed. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen
10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could
have fallen only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant,
the difference would continue to increase.

 

 




 



19



 




  

If the
futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next
month contract for a higher price than the current near month
contract. Using again the $50 per barrel price above to represent
the front month price, the price of the next month contract could
be $51 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month
contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either
prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the
spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract
(and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned
on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month
contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new
near month contract with a price of $50. In this example, it would
mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend
to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil, or fall faster. As
a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the
spot price of crude oil to have risen 10% after some period of
time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures
contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough
or enough time has elapsed. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil
could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the
second month futures contract could have fallen 12%. Over time, if
contango remained constant, the difference would continue to
increase.

Historically,
the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of
contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place
roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading, started in
1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter
of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in
contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009,
the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack
U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the
physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led
to unusually high inventories of crude oil. Since then, a
combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along
with growing demand for crude oil globally, has moderated the
inventory build-up and lead to reduced levels of contango by
2011. The crude oil futures market was primarily in a state of
contango during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Periods of
contango or backwardation do not materially impact the Fund’s
investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its
per share NAV track, on a leveraged basis, the daily percentage
changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract since
the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally
impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the
Fund’s shares and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. It is
impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether
backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely
that both conditions will occur during different
periods.

  Trading
Methodology

In
managing the Fund’s assets, USCF does not use a technical
trading system that issues buy and sell orders. USCF instead
employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation
Basket is sold, USCF purchases Oil Interests, such as the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that
approximates three times (3x) the amount of Treasuries and/or cash
received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket. As of the NAV
calculation time each trading day, the Fund will also seek to
position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is consistent with its investment objective to
provide investment results that correspond (before fees and
expenses) to three times (3x) the performance of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.

The
specific Oil Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors,
including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification
of the Fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect
to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of
particular contracts. While USCF has made significant investments
in NYMEX Oil Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the
ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude
oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements
limiting the Fund’s holdings, and market conditions, it may
invest in Oil Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest
in Other Oil-Related Investments. To the extent that the Fund
invests in Other Oil-Related Investments, it would prioritize
investments in contracts and instruments that are economically
equivalent to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including cleared
swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it
would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts,
instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the
over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the “OTC
market”). If the Fund is required by law or regulation, or by
one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its
position in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts to the applicable
position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market
conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other
Oil-Related Investments, a substantial portion of the Fund’s
assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other
Oil-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return
on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. As the Fund’s assets
reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits,
accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result,
it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such
priority in Other Oil-Related Investments at such higher levels. In
addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could
cause the Fund to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include
those allowing the Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute
transactions with more favorable pricing. See “Risk Factors
Involved With an Investment in the Fund” for a discussion of
the potential impact of regulation on the Fund’s ability to
invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

USCF may
not be able to fully invest the Fund’s assets in Benchmark
Oil Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly
equal to three times (3x) the Fund’s NAV. For example, as
standardized contracts, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are for
a specified amount of a particular commodity, and the Fund’s
NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are
unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
As a result, in such circumstances, the Fund may be better able to
achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract through the use of Other Oil-Related
Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation
with changes in price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

The Fund
anticipates that to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts
other than contracts on light, sweet crude oil (such as futures
contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other
petroleum-based fuels) and Other Oil-Related Investments, it will
enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to
hedge the short-term price movements of such Oil Futures Contracts
and Other Oil-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.

USCF does
not anticipate letting the Fund’s Oil Futures Contracts
expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead,
USCF will close existing positions, e.g. , when it changes
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related
Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to
do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Oil Futures Contracts or
Other Oil-Related Investments. Positions may also be closed out to
meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for
such baskets will not be reinvested.

The
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is changed from the near month
contract to the next month contract over a four-day period. Each
month, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract changes starting at the
end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the
near month contract for that month. During the first three days of
the period, the applicable value of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract is based on a combination of the near month contract and
the next month contract as follows: (1) day 1 consists of 75%
of the then near month contract’s price plus 25% of the price
of the next month contract, divided by 75% of the near month
contract’s prior day’s price plus 25% of the price of
the next month contract, (2) day 2 consists of 50% of the then
near month contract’s price plus 50% of the price of the next
month contract, divided by 50% of the near month contract’s
prior day’s price plus 50% of the price of the next month
contract and (3) day 3 consists of 25% of the then near month
contract’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month
contract, divided by 25% of the near month contract’s prior
day’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month contract.
On day 4, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the next month
contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract until the beginning of the following
month’s change in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over a
four-day period.

On each
day during the four-day period, USCF anticipates it will
“roll” the Fund’s positions in Oil Interests by
closing, or selling, a percentage of the Fund’s positions in
Oil Interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those
positions in new Oil Interests that reflect the change in the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

The
anticipated dates that the monthly four-day roll period will
commence are posted on the Fund’s website at [ • ], and
are subject to change without notice.

By
remaining invested as fully as possible in Oil Futures Contracts or
Other Oil-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes
in percentage terms of the Fund’s NAV will continue to
closely track, on a leveraged basis, the daily changes in
percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result
in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking
the NAV of the Fund. Additionally, Oil Futures Contracts traded on
the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of light, sweet crude
oil. Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that
the changes in the price of the Fund’s shares as traded on
the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely
track on a daily basis, the changes in the spot price of light,
sweet crude oil on a percentage basis.

  What
are the Trading Policies of the Fund?

 

Investment
Objectives

The Fund
seeks, on a daily basis, to provide investment results that
correspond (before fees and expenses) to three times (3x) the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund does
not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than
a single day. Because the Fund seeks investment results for a
single day only (as measured from the time the Fund calculates its
NAV to the time of the Fund’s next NAV calculation) and on a
leveraged basis, the Fund is different from most exchange-traded
funds.

 

 

 




 



21



 




  

As of the
NAV calculation time each trading day, the Fund will seek to
position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is consistent with its investment objective. The
impact of a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s movements during
the day will affect whether the Fund’s portfolio needs to be
rebalanced. For example, the Fund’s long exposure will need
to be increased on days when the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
rises and decreased on days the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
falls. Daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s
return over time means that the return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s
returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ
from three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for the period. The Fund may lose money if the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract’s performance is flat over time, and it
is possible for a Fund to lose money over time regardless of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, as a result of
daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
volatility and compounding.

There can
be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective
or avoid substantial losses. The Fund does not seek to achieve its
stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a
single day because mathematical compounding prevents the Fund from
achieving such results. Results for the Fund over periods of time
greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple
multiple (3x) of the period return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract and will likely differ significantly from such. The Fund
may lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
performance is flat over time, and it is possible for the Fund to
lose money over time regardless of the performance of the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, as a result of daily rebalancing, the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s volatility and compounding.
Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns can
dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance
during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as
important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

Liquidity

 

The Fund
invests only in Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related
Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient
volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in
these financial interests and in Other Oil-Related Investments
that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the
original counterparty or through a third party assuming the
position of the Fund.

Spot
Commodities

 

While the
crude Oil Futures Contracts traded can be physically settled, the
Fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery. The Fund
may from time to time trade in Other Oil-Related Investments,
including contracts based on the spot price of crude
oil.

Leverage

 

USCF
endeavors to have the aggregate market value of its obligations
under its Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments
equal to three times (3x) the value of the Fund’s Treasuries,
cash and cash equivalents, whether held by the Fund or posted as
margin or other collateral, at the close of each trading day (as
measured at the time the Fund calculates its NAV). Commodity
pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other
related investments are typically required to be secured by the
deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a
futures contract’s (or other commodity interest’s)
entire market value.

Borrowings

 

Borrowings
are not expected to be used by the Fund unless the Fund is required
to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if the Fund
trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by
unexpected redemptions.

OTC
Derivatives (Including Spreads and Straddles)

 

In
addition to Oil Futures Contracts, there are also a number of
listed options on the Oil Futures Contracts on the principal
futures exchanges. These contracts offer investors and hedgers
another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to
the crude oil market. Consequently, the Fund may purchase options
on crude Oil Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its
investment objective.

 

 




 



22



 




  

In
addition to the Oil Futures Contracts and options on the Oil
Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded
market in derivatives tied to crude oil. These derivatives
transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into
between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the
exchange-traded Oil Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on
the Oil Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the
credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the
other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its
contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with
such contracts, the Fund will generally enter into an agreement
with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
(“ISDA”) that provides for the netting of its overall
exposure to its counterparty.

USCF
assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each
potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to
guidelines approved by USCF’s board.

The Fund
may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is
exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (an “Exchange
for Related Position” or “EFRP transaction”). In
the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by the Fund,
the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of
the Fund shares. These EFRP transactions may expose the Fund to
counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution
of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures
contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP
transaction will exist only on the day of execution.

The Fund
may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the
differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking,
on a leveraged basis, the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund would use a spread when it chooses to take
simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the
same underlying asset, but with different delivery
months.

The Fund
does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed
on a foreign exchange, forward contracts or options on such
contracts, but it may do so as outlined in the Fund’s listing
exemptive order or as permitted under current
regulations.

Pyramiding

 

USCF has
not employed, and will not employ, the technique, commonly known as
pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on
existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of
additional positions in the same or another commodity
interest.

 USCF Funds Trust (Form: 424B3, Received: 07/19/2017 09:27:01) 













	Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)






	Registration No. 333-214825






	 






	United
	States 3x Oil Fund*






	30,000,000
	Shares






	*Principal
	U.S. Listing Exchange: NYSE Arca, Inc.




	 


	THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS POOL NOR
	HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED ON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.



	 




	The United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”), a series of the USCF Funds Trust, is a fund that issues
	shares that trade on NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. (“NYSE”). The investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times (3x) the daily change
	in percentage terms of the price of a specified short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract.” The Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the futures contract on light, sweet crude oil as traded on
	the New York Mercantile Exchange (the “NYMEX”), traded under the trading symbol “CL” (for WTI Crude Oil
	futures), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in
	which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire. The Fund seeks a return that
	is 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day. The Fund should not be expected to provide 300% of
	the cumulative return for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for periods greater than a day.




	 




	The Fund will
	seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil that are traded
	on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”).




	 




	The Fund will,
	to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements and/or market conditions:




	 








	(i)




	next
	invest in (a) cleared swap transactions based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
	(b) non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”), negotiated
	swap contracts that are based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and (c) forward
	contracts for oil;





	 


	 


	 









	(ii)




	followed
	by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil,
	gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels, each of which are traded on the
	NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap
	transactions and OTC swap contracts valued based on the foregoing; and






	 








	(iii)




	finally,
	invest in exchange-traded cash settled options on Oil Futures Contracts.





	 


	 


	 





	All such other investments are referred
	to as “Other Oil-Related Investments” and, together with Oil Futures Contracts, are “Oil Interests.” The
	Fund will support its investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations
	in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (“Treasuries”), cash and cash equivalents. The
	majority of the Fund’s assets will be held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents.




	The Fund pays
	its sponsor, United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), a limited liability company, a management fee and incurs
	certain other costs. The address of both USCF and the Fund is 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612. The telephone
	number for both USCF and the Fund is 510.522.9600. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares to breakeven over the next
	12 months, assuming a selling price of $25.00 the investment would have to generate 0.91 % return or $ 0.23.




	The Fund
	is an exchange traded fund. This means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of the Fund place their trade orders
	through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shares of the Fund trade on NYSE under the ticker
	symbol “USOU” and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded
	securities.




	 




	Shares
	will trade on NYSE after they are initially purchased by “Authorized Participants,” institutional firms that
	purchase shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called “baskets” through the Fund’s marketing agent,
	ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the “Marketing Agent”). The initial price per share will be $25, the initial price per
	basket will be $1,250,000, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC is the initial Authorized Participant. Thereafter, the price
	of a basket will be equal to the NAV of 50,000 shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the
	Marketing Agent. The NAV per share will be calculated by taking the current market value of the Fund’s total assets
	(after close of NYSE) subtracting any liabilities and dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
	Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering
	prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on NYSE, the NAV of the shares at
	the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets, the NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the
	shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Oil Futures Contract
	market and the market for Other Oil-Related Investments. Please see below for additional information. The offering of the
	Fund’s shares will be a “best efforts” offering, which means that no Authorized Participant is required to
	purchase a specific number or dollar amount of shares nor is the Marketing Agent required to facilitate any specific number
	or dollar amount of creation or redemption orders for baskets.




	USCF will
	pay the Marketing Agent a service fee. Aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for marketing
	and/or distribution-related services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
	gross proceeds of the offering.




	 





	The Fund is
	not appropriate for all investors and presents many different risks than other types of funds, including risks associated with
	the use of leverage. The Fund is intended to be a daily trading tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.
	The Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract. Additionally, the Fund is designed to achieve its stated investment objective on a daily basis, but its performance
	over different periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily objective. The Fund is riskier than securities that
	have intermediate or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the Fund
	for a period other than one day. The return of the Fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for
	each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the 300% of the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	for the same period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term
	performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as important to the Fund’s return for a period
	as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Accordingly, the Fund should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors
	who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long investment results. Investors should actively
	and frequently monitor their investments in the Fund, even intra-day. It is possible that you will suffer significant losses in
	the Fund even if the long-term performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is positive.





	Investors
	who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the
	underlying Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts in which the Fund invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary
	trading market for shares. Investing in the Fund involves risks similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contracts, and other significant risks. See “

	Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund

	”
	beginning on page 6.




	The offering
	of the Fund’s shares is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in accordance with the
	Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering and is not expected
	to terminate until all of the registered shares have been sold or three years from the date of the original offering, whichever
	is earlier, unless extended as permitted under the rules under the 1933 Act, although the offering may be temporarily suspended
	if and when no suitable investments for the Fund are available or practicable. The Fund is not an investment company registered
	under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under such Act.





	NEITHER
	THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, OR DETERMINED
	IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.





	The Fund
	is a commodity pool and USCF is a commodity pool operator subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”)
	and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act (“CEA”).

	RISK DISCLOSURE
	STATEMENT






	YOU
	SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION PERMITS YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMODITY POOL. IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD
	BE AWARE THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE
	THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS
	MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL.






	FURTHER,
	COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR
	THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.
	THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED THIS POOL AT PAGE 56 AND A STATEMENT
	OF THE PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE 57.






	THIS
	BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL.
	THEREFORE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMODITY POOL, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, INCLUDING
	A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE 6.






	YOU
	SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY TRADE FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED
	OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER
	DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE
	TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE TRANSACTIONS
	FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.






	SWAPS
	TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR
	SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS
	INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OPERATIONAL
	RISK.






	HIGHLY
	CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY
	LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE
	OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.






	IN
	EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT
	A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY
	NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE POOL’S
	OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOL’S EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY






	This
	is only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material information about the Fund and its shares, it does not contain
	or summarize all of the information about the Fund and its shares contained in this prospectus that is material and/or which may
	be important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including “Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the
	Fund” beginning on page 6, before making an investment decision about the shares. For a glossary of defined terms, see Appendix
	A.





	 





	The Fund is not appropriate for
	all investors and present different risks than other types of funds, including risks associated with the effects of leveraged
	investing. An investor should only consider an investment in the Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily
	leveraged investment results. The Fund seeks to return (before fees and expenses) a multiple (3x) of the performance of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract for a single day, not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period longer than a single day
	is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period and usually will differ from the Fund’s multiple times
	the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the same period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns
	can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least
	as important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund uses leverage
	and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. For example,
	the return of the Fund for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a fund for a single day
	with an objective of matching the same Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage
	and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.





	 







	The Trust and the Fund






	 




	The USCF Funds Trust (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on March 2, 2016 pursuant
	to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”) formed on June 23, 2017, is one of
	the series of the Trust (each such series, a “REX Fund” and together, the “REX Funds”). The Fund is a commodity
	pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on

	NYSE

	.
	The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the
	“Trust Agreement”), dated as of June 23, 2017. Wilmington Trust, National Association, a national banking association,
	with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust and the Fund are
	managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited liability company formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered
	as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member
	of the National Futures Association (“NFA”).









	The Fund’s Investment
	Objective and Strategy





	 




	The investment objective of the Fund will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’
	per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the price of
	a specified short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil (the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract”) less the Fund’s
	expenses. To achieve this objective, USCF will endeavor to have the notional value of the Fund’s aggregate exposure to the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund will
	seek a return that is 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day and does not seek to achieve its
	stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. The pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that
	the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to 300% of the return of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the Fund is the product of
	the series of each trading day’s daily returns.




	 







	What Is the “Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract”?





	 




	The Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the futures contract on light, sweet crude oil as traded on the New
	York Mercantile Exchange (the “NYMEX”), traded under the trading symbol “CL” (for WTI Crude Oil futures),
	that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case
	it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire.




	 









	1










	 









	How Does the Fund Intend to Meet
	Its Investment Objectives?






	 





	The Fund will seek to achieve
	its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil that are traded on the NYMEX,
	ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”).




	 The
	Fund will, to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements and/or market conditions:








	(i)




	next
	invest in (a) cleared swap transactions based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
	(b) non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”), negotiated
	swap contracts that are based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and (c) forward
	contracts for oil;





	 


	 


	 









	(ii)




	followed
	by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil,
	gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels, each of which are traded on the
	NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap
	transactions and OTC swap contracts valued based on the foregoing; and






	 








	(iii)




	finally, invest in exchange-traded
	cash settled options on Oil Futures Contracts.





	 


	 


	 





	All such other investments
	are referred to as “Other Oil-Related Investments” and, together with Oil Futures Contracts, are “Oil Interests.”



	For the Fund to maintain a consistent 300% return versus the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the Fund’s
	holdings must be rebalanced on a daily basis by buying additional Oil Interests or selling Oil Interests that it holds. Such rebalancing
	will occur generally before or at the close of trading of the shares on the Exchange, at or as near as possible to that day’s
	settlement price, and will be disclosed on the Fund’s website as pending trades before the opening of trading on the Exchange
	the next business day and will be taken into account in the Fund’s intra-day Indicative Fund Value and reflected in the Fund’s
	end of day NAV on that business day.



	 The
	Fund anticipates that, to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts other than the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or Other
	Oil-Related Investments, it will invest in futures, cleared and non-cleared swaps, and call and put options to hedge the short-term
	price movements of such Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments against the price movements of the current Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract. For example, if the Fund invested in diesel-heating oil futures contracts, it may also enter into a swap
	or forward contract that is valued based on the difference between the diesel-heating oil futures contract and the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract so that the investment in the diesel-heating oil futures contracts together with such swap would provide a return
	that more closely matches the movements in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




	USCF currently
	anticipates that regulatory requirements such as accountability levels set by exchanges or position limits set by exchanges or
	by other regulators, such as the CFTC, and market conditions including those allowing the Fund to obtain greater liquidity or
	to execute transactions with more favorable pricing, could cause the Fund to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments.




	The Fund
	will support its investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations
	in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (“Treasuries”), cash and cash equivalents. Cash
	equivalents are short-term instruments with maturities of less than three months and shall include the following: (i) certificates
	of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or savings and loan association; (ii) bankers’ acceptances, which are
	short-term credit instruments used to finance commercial transactions; (iii) repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements;
	(iv) bank time deposits, which are monies kept on deposit with banks or savings and loan associations for a stated period of time
	at a fixed rate of interest; (v) commercial paper, which are short-term unsecured promissory notes; and (vi) money market funds.




	The Fund
	may invest in money market funds, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets
	not used for margin or collateral in the Oil Interests. The majority of the Fund’s assets will be held in Treasuries, cash
	and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian. 









	2










	 








	The Fund
	will seek to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, less
	the Fund’s expenses, will track three times (3x) the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, also
	measured in percentage terms. As a specific benchmark, USCF will endeavor to place the Fund’s trades in Oil Interests and
	otherwise manage the Fund’s investments so that the difference between “A” and “B” will be plus/minus
	0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”, where: 








	•




	A is the average daily percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV for any period of thirty (30) successive
	valuation days, i.e., any

	NYSE trading day as of which
	the Fund calculates its per share NAV, less the Fund’s expenses; and







	 








	•




	B
	is three times the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract over the same period.






	 




	The design of the Fund’s
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month
	contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month contract to expire
	as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration.
	In the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts
	(“backwardation” ), then, absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices, the value of the benchmark
	contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. Conversely, in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month
	contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts (“contango”), then, absent the impact of the overall movement
	in crude oil prices, the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.




	USCF believes that market
	arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in the Fund’s share price on NYSE on a percentage basis, to closely track
	the daily changes in the Fund’s per share NAV on a percentage basis. The Fund will not seek to achieve its stated investment
	objective over a period of time

	greater than one day

	. The pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return
	of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the Fund is the product of the series
	of each trading day’s daily returns. During periods of market volatility, the volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	may affect the Fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Further, the return
	for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day will not be the
	product of the return of the Fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	for the full trading day. Additionally, investors should be aware that the Fund’s investment objective is not for its NAV
	or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Natural market forces called contango
	and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical direct investment
	in crude oil and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of the Fund’s shares and changes
	in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to
	note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil, which could
	be substantial.)







	Principal Investment Risks
	of an Investment in the Fund





	 




	An investment
	in the Fund involves a degree of risk. Some of the risks you may face are summarized below. A more extensive discussion of these
	risks appears beginning on page 6.





	Investment Risk





	 




	Investors may
	choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the
	crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate.





	Correlation Risk





	 




	To the extent
	that investors use the Fund as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil, there is the risk that the daily changes in the price
	of the Fund’s shares on the NYSE on a percentage basis, will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of light,
	sweet crude oil on a percentage basis. This could happen if the price of shares traded on the NYSE does not correlate closely
	with the value of the Fund’s NAV; the changes in the Fund’s NAV do not correlate closely with the changes in the price
	of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract; or the changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract do not closely correlate
	with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil. This is a risk because if these correlations do not exist, then investors
	may not be able to use the Fund as a cost-effective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of loss
	in crude oil-related transactions.




	 









	3










	 








	The price relationship
	between the near month contract to expire and the next month contract to expire that compose the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	will vary and may impact both the total return over time of the Fund’s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total return
	tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns. In cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than
	the next month contract’s price (a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets), then absent the impact
	of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
	In cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than the next month contract’s price (a situation known
	as “backwardation” in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the
	value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.




	 





	Compounding Risk





	 




	The Fund has
	a single-day investment objective. Because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the
	return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period,
	which will very likely differ from 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period. The Fund may
	lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the volatility
	of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time
	while the level of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract increases.




	 





	The Fund is
	designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment
	results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate
	for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios.






	 






	Tax Risk





	 




	The Fund is organized
	and operated as a Delaware statutory trust, in accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and applicable state law,
	but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual
	funds.





	Over-the-Counter (“OTC”)
	Contract Risk





	 




	The Fund may
	also invest in negotiated “OTC” contracts, which are not as liquid as exchange-traded futures contracts. OTC contracts
	expose the Fund to the risk that the Fund’s counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the Fund.





	Other Risks





	 




	The Fund pays
	fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable.




	Unlike
	mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains
	and distribute such income and gains to their investors, the Fund generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other
	shareholders. You should not invest in the Fund if you will need cash distributions from the Fund to pay taxes on your share of
	income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for any other reason.




	The Fund
	has no operating history, so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the Fund.




	You will
	have no rights to participate in the management of the Fund and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to manage
	the Fund.




	The Fund
	is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, the Marketing Agent, various commodity futures brokers and
	Authorized Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. USCF’s
	personnel are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the Fund for their services, including
	other commodity pools (funds) that USCF manages (these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “Related Public Funds”
	and are identified in the Glossary). USCF could have a conflict between its responsibilities to the Fund and to those other entities.
	As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other
	than in the best interest of the Fund and the shareholders.

	The Fund is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on daily net assets and paid monthly
	of 1.35% per annum on average net assets. Average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total net
	assets of the Fund over the calendar year,

	i.e.

	, the sum of daily total net assets divided by the number of calendar days
	in the year. On days when markets are closed, the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was
	open.






	(2)




	The Fund determined this estimate as follows based on the Fund having two

	blocks
	of 50,000 shares (“Creation Baskets”) sold and 100,000 shares outstanding. Assuming the price of a share is $25.00,
	the Fund would receive $2,500,000 upon the sale of a Creation Basket (100,000 shares multiplied by $25.00). Assuming no change
	in the settlement price of the contracts, the Fund would be required to sell and purchase positions in 150 futures contracts each
	month to support shares sold in the Creation Basket ($2,500,000 divided by the total value of the futures contracts at an assumed
	settlement price for the futures contract of $50,000, multiplied by 3 for the leverage). Assuming futures commission merchants
	charge approximately $3.22 per futures contract for each buy or sale, the monthly futures commission merchant commission charge
	per contract would be approximately $6.44 (except on the first month in which it would be approximately $3.22 because there is
	no roll), and the annual futures commission merchant commission charge per contract would be approximately $74.06. Assuming no
	change in the settlement price of the contracts, the Fund would sell and buy 150 futures contracts each month to support a Creation
	Basket, which means that the Fund’s annual commission charge per two Creation Baskets without rebalancing would be approximately
	$11,109 (150 contracts bought and sold * approximately $6.44 per month *11.5 months). The estimated daily rebalancing cost of 1%
	of holdings is $1,217 (1% * 150 contracts * 252, the number of NYSE trading days * $3.22). The Fund’s annual commission charge
	per two Creation Baskets with rebalancing is $12,326 (the annual commission charge plus the rebalancing cost). As a percentage
	of the total investment of $2,500,000 to support the issuance of two Creation Baskets, the Fund’s annual commission expense
	would be approximately 0.49% ($12,326 divided by $2,500,000 per annum).

	RISK FACTORS
	INVOLVED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND






	You
	should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information
	included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports, which includes the Trust’s and the Fund’s
	financial statements and related notes.








	Risks Related to Leveraged
	Investments







	Due to the compounding
	of daily returns, the Fund’s returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even
	direction from the Fund multiple times the benchmark return for the period.






	 




	The investment
	objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect three times (3x) the daily
	change in percentage terms of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, as
	measured from NAV calculation time to NAV calculation time, and not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period
	longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period, and usually will differ from three
	times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the same period. The Fund could lose money over time regardless
	of the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including as a result of daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract’s volatility, and compounding. Longer holding periods, higher volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
	and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the Fund’s returns. Daily compounding of the Fund’s
	investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility
	may be at least as important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




	The Fund
	uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
	For example, the return for a single day should be approximately three times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund
	with an objective of matching the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund is not appropriate for all investors
	and present different risks than other funds. The Fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded
	funds that do not use leverage. An investor should only consider an investment in the Fund if he or she understands the consequences
	of seeking daily leveraged investment results for a single day. Daily objective leveraged funds, if used properly and in conjunction
	with the investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the markets, can be useful tools for investors who want
	to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing to monitor and/or periodically rebalance their
	portfolios. Shareholders who invest in the Fund should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.




	In general,
	during periods of higher volatility for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, compounding will cause the Fund’s results for
	periods longer than a single day to be less than three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. This
	effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases. Conversely, in periods of lower volatility for the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract (particularly when combined with higher returns for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract), the Fund’s returns over
	longer periods can be higher than three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Actual results for a
	particular period, before fees and expenses, are also dependent on the magnitude of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	in addition to the volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.






	Intraday Price/Performance
	Risk.






	The Fund
	is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its NAV calculation. As such, the intraday position of the Fund will generally
	be different from the Fund’s stated daily investment objective (i.e., 3x). When shares are bought intraday, the performance
	of the Fund’s shares until the Fund’s next NAV calculation will generally be greater than or less than the Fund’s
	stated daily multiple.






	The use of leveraged
	positions could result in the total loss of an investor’s investment.






	The Fund
	utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its
	respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not employ leverage. The use of leveraged positions could result in
	the total loss of an investor’s investment.




	 








	6










	 







	For example,
	because the investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect three
	times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, a single-day movement in the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract approaching 33% at any point in the day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor’s
	investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the Fund, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract subsequently
	moves in an opposite direction, eliminating all or a portion of the movement. This would be the case with downward single-day
	or intraday movements in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract maintains a level greater
	than zero at all times.







	Investment Risk






	 






	The NAV of
	the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other assets held by the Fund
	and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Fund’s shares.





	The net
	assets of the Fund consist primarily of investments in Oil Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Oil-Related Investments.
	The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid
	expenses), which in turn relates to the price of light, sweet crude oil in the marketplace. Crude oil prices depend on local,
	regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.





	Economic
	conditions impacting crude oil.

	The demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence
	of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on crude oil prices.
	Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth
	rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand
	for crude oil. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity
	crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or
	conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for crude oil.





	Other
	crude oil demand-related factors.

	Other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its price, include
	technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for crude oil associated with
	heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with
	oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
	choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.





	Other
	crude oil supply-related factors.

	Crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example,
	increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends
	to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases
	in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil. World oil supply levels can also
	be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to the Organization of the Petroleum
	Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions
	in competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological
	change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture
	petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil.





	Other
	factors impacting the crude oil market.

	The supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes in interest
	rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy sources.





	Price
	Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment.

	Futures contracts have a high degree of price variability
	and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment
	in the Fund.







	Correlation Risk





	Investors
	purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors
	pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil. Investing in the Fund’s shares for hedging purposes
	involves the following risks:




	 








	7










	 









	 




	•




	 




	The market price at
	which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Daily percentage changes
	in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes, on a leveraged basis in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Daily percentage changes
	in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of
	light, sweet crude oil.





	 


	 


	 


	 





	Further,
	in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the Fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios
	daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives. Being materially under- or overexposed to the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract may prevent the Fund from achieving a high degree of correlation with the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Market
	disruptions or closures, large amounts of assets into or out of the Fund, regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility
	will adversely affect the Fund’s ability to adjust exposure to requisite levels. The target amount of portfolio exposure
	is impacted dynamically by the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s movements during each day. Because of this, it is unlikely
	that the Fund will be perfectly exposed (i.e., 3x) at the end of each day, and the likelihood of being materially under- or overexposed
	is higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the close of the trading day.




	In addition,
	unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios as frequently, the Fund may be subject to increased trading costs associated
	with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks. Such costs include commissions
	paid to the FCMs, and may vary by FCM.






	The market price at
	which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.






	The Fund’s NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of
	the Fund’s portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from
	their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares. Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at
	work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing
	the prices of the light, sweet crude oil and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation
	of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading
	price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.



	The NAV of the Fund’s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE
	and the various futures exchanges on which crude oil is traded. While the shares trade on the NYSE from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
	Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during
	all of this time. For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global light sweet
	crude market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. As a result, during periods when the NYSE
	is open and the futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium
	or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the
	shares.





	Daily percentage changes
	in the Fund’s NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes, on a leveraged basis, in the price of the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract.






	It is
	possible that the daily percentage changes in the Fund’s NAV per share may not closely correlate, on a leveraged basis,
	to daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions
	in the market for light, sweet crude oil, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other
	extraordinary circumstances. As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	and other Oil Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, the Fund may begin investing in Other Oil-Related Investments.
	In addition, the Fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract because
	the total return generated by the Fund is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with
	the Fund’s trading activities, and increased by interest income from the Fund’s holdings of Treasuries (defined below).
	Tracking the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract requires trading of the Fund’s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.






	Daily percentage changes
	in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of light,
	sweet crude oil.






	The correlation
	between changes in prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only approximate.
	The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market, supply
	of and demand for Oil Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract) and Other Oil-Related Investments, and
	technical influences in oil futures trading.

	Natural forces in the
	oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase the Fund’s tracking error
	and/or negatively impact total return.






	The design of the Fund’s Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is such that every month it begins by using
	the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, when, over a four day period,
	it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it
	becomes the near month contract and close to expiration. In the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts
	trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts, a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures
	market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise
	as it approaches expiration. Conversely, in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower
	price than next month contracts, a situation described as “contango” in the futures market, then absent the impact
	of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration.
	When compared to total return of other price indices, such as the spot price of crude oil, the impact of backwardation and contango
	may cause the total return of the Fund’s per share NAV to vary significantly. Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling
	oil prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on the Fund’s per share NAV and total
	return and investors could lose part or all of their investment. See “Additional Information About the Fund, its Investment
	Objective and Investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation.






	Accountability levels,
	position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could
	cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.






	 




	Designated
	contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures Europe have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum
	net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control
	(other than as a hedge, which an investment by the Fund is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply
	to the futures contracts that the Fund invests in to meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels and position
	limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures Europe also set daily price limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes
	the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price.
	Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond
	that limit.




	 




	The
	accountability levels for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and other Oil Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges,
	such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control
	over an investor’s positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract is 10,000 contracts and the all month accountability level is 20,000 contracts. The current ICE Futures Europe accountability
	level for any one month in the ICE WTI Crude Futures Contract (the most comparable future to the Benchmark Oil Futures contract)
	is 10,000 contracts and the all month accountability level is 20,000 contracts. If the Fund and the Related Public Funds exceed
	these accountability levels for investments in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, the NYMEX and ICE Futures Europe will monitor
	such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and
	trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of the Fund and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX
	and/or ICE Futures Europe, The Fund could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net futures contracts back to the accountability
	level. At this time, given the size of the oil futures market, it is unlikely that a fund or its Related Public Fund will exceed
	the above accountability levels.

	Position
	limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any
	person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability
	levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and ICE Futures Europe impose position limits on contracts held
	in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. The relevant exchange current spot limit for the Benchmark
	Oil futures Contract and the ICE WTI Crude Oil futures contract is 3,000 contracts. It is unlikely that the Fund will run up against
	such position limits because The Fund’s investment strategy is to close out its positions and “roll” from the
	near month contract to expire to the next month contract during a four-day period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract.




	 




	The
	CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in certain physical commodity futures and option contracts related
	to such futures and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contract futures (including energy contracts, such as the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contracts (the “Position Limit Rules”). The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which
	contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person
	may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute
	bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets (“DCMs”) and swap execution
	facilities (“SEFs”) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both
	futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as certain non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC’s
	first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and,
	since then, the CFTC has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times. At this time, it is unclear
	how the Position Limit Rules may affect the Fund, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position
	Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of the Fund to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF’s
	ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund.




	 




	Until
	such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position
	Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related. Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation
	in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability
	levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, the Fund may be limited
	with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.




	 




	Under
	existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required,
	subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with
	all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as
	the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that market participant
	(the “Aggregation Rules”). The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when
	such Position Limit Rules are adopted.




	All of
	these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract. This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against
	crude oil-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil.




	The Fund
	has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Oil Futures
	Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments. If the Fund encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation
	limits for Oil Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures Europe, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements,
	purchase Oil Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions
	to meet its investment objective. In addition, if the Fund exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures Europe
	and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the
	price of the Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.





	 








	Tax Risk





	 






	An investor’s tax liability
	may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.






	 




	Cash or property
	will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect
	to shares. Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax,
	on their allocable share of the Fund’s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount
	of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash
	or value of property (if any) distributed.




	 








	10










	 









	An investor’s allocable
	share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.






	 



	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the Fund in making allocations for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes and other factors, an investor’s allocable share of the Fund’s income, gain, deduction
	or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be temporary
	or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.





	Items of income, gain,
	deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017,
	the Fund could be liable for U.S. federal income tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not accept
	the assumptions and conventions applied by the Fund in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.






	 




	The U.S. tax
	rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded entities such as
	the Fund is in many respects uncertain. The Fund applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the
	intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects
	shareholders’ economic gains and losses. These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the
	Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will
	successfully challenge the Fund’s allocation methods and require the Fund to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction,
	loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors. If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax
	return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.




	 




	In addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Fund may be liable for U.S. federal income
	tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of
	the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases
	in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations
	of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor.
	If the Fund is required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce
	the net assets of the Fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares. Under certain circumstances, the
	Fund may be eligible to make an election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement,
	including any interest and penalties. The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Fund to make this election is uncertain.
	If the election is made, the Fund would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year
	to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment (“Adjusted
	K-1s”). The investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s
	are issued. For an additional discussion please see “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations – Other Tax Matters.”





	The Fund could be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.





	 




	The
	Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, the Fund
	will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that
	(i) at least 90 percent of the Fund’s annual gross income consists of “qualifying income” as defined
	in the Code, (ii) the Trust and the Fund is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and
	applicable law and (iii) the Trust and the Fund does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes. Although USCF anticipates that the Fund will satisfy the “qualifying income” requirement for all of
	its taxable years, that result cannot be assured. The Fund has not requested and nor will the Fund request any ruling from
	the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Fund is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to
	shareholders, the Fund would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates. In addition, although
	the Fund currently does not intend to make any distributions with respect to the shares any distributions would be taxable to
	shareholders as dividend income to the extent of the Fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to
	holding period and other requirements, any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax at
	the lower maximum tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains. Taxation of the Trust and the Fund as a corporation could
	materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the
	shares.






	The Fund is organized
	and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and applicable state law,
	but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual
	funds.

	The Fund is organized
	and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and applicable state law,
	but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual
	funds. No U.S. federal income tax is paid by the Fund on its income. Instead, the Fund will furnish shareholders each year with
	tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax
	return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of the Fund. This must be reported without regard to the amount
	(if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the Fund during the taxable year. A shareholder,
	therefore, may be allocated income or gain by the Fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting
	from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.



	In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local
	income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed
	by the various jurisdictions in which the Fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside. Although an analysis
	of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment
	in the Fund. It is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.



	 






	If the Fund is required to
	withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders.






	Under
	certain circumstances, the Fund may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders. Although
	the Trust Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, the Fund
	may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts
	were withheld since the Fund does not intend to make any distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the withholding
	may be borne by all shareholders, not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could have a material
	impact on the value of the shares.





	 








	OTC Contract Risk





	 






	Currently, OTC transactions
	are subject to changing regulation.






	 




	A portion of
	the Fund’s assets may be used to trade OTC contracts, such as forward contracts, options, swaps or spot contracts. OTC contracts
	are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major
	money center and investment banks and other institutions. The markets for OTC contracts rely upon the integrity of market participants
	in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets. While certain regulations adopted
	over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the OTC market, complying with such
	regulations could have substantial and adverse effects on the Fund.




	 






	The Fund
	will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of the Fund
	or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.






	 




	The Fund faces
	the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these
	contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of
	financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may
	not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund, in which case the Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts.




	If a counterparty
	becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant
	delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Trust on behalf of the Fund may obtain
	only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.






	Valuing OTC derivatives
	may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments.






	 




	In general, valuing
	OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and
	securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are
	individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition,
	while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they
	typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may
	be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.




	 








	12










	 










	Compounding Risk





	The Fund
	has a single-day investment objective, and the Fund’s performance for periods greater than a single day will be the result
	of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance of the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract times the stated multiple in the Fund’s investment objective, before accounting for fees
	and fund expenses. Compounding affects all investments, but it has a more significant effect on a leveraged fund. Particularly
	during periods of higher Benchmark Oil Futures Contract volatility, compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single
	day to vary from three times (3x) of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. This effect becomes more pronounced as
	volatility increases. Fund performance for periods greater than a single day will be affected by the following factors: (i) Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract volatility, (ii) Benchmark Oil Futures Contract performance, (iii) period of time, (iv) financing rates associated
	with exposure and (v) other Fund expenses.




	The Fund
	is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
	investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
	appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios.





	 





	The Fund’s
	returns over periods longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from three times the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract return for the period as a result of compounding of daily returns.




	 



	The Fund has an investment objective of corresponding (before fees and expenses) to 3x or for the Fund’s
	related inverse fund, (“United States 3X Short Oil Fund”), an inverse multiple of -3x the performance of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract for a given day. The Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, as measured from the calculation
	of the NAV for a particular day to the calculation of the NAV for the next day (see “Calculating Per Share NAV”). The
	return of the Fund for a period longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day compounded over the period, and
	usually will differ from three times (3x) or three times the inverse (-3x) for the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, of the return
	of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
	performance is flat over time, and it is possible for the Fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract, as a result of daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s volatility and compounding.
	Longer holding periods, higher Benchmark Oil Futures Contract volatility, inverse exposure and greater leverage each affect the
	impact of compounding on the Fund’s returns. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns can dramatically and
	adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as important to the
	Fund’s return for a period as the return of the Fund’s underlying Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.



	 




	The
	Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
	For example, the return for a single day of the Fund with a 3x multiple should be approximately three times as volatile for a
	single day as the return of the Fund with an objective of matching the same Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The return for a single
	day of the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, with a -3x multiple should be approximately three times the inverse (-3x) of the return that
	would be expected of a fund with an objective of matching the same Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund is not appropriate
	for all investors and presents different risks than other funds. The Fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked
	exchange-traded funds that do not use leverage. An investor should only consider an investment in the Fund or the United States 3X Short
	Oil Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged or daily inverse leveraged investment results for
	a single day. Leveraged funds, if used properly and in conjunction with the investor’s view on the future direction and
	volatility of the markets, can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their exposure to various markets and market segments
	and who are willing to monitor and/or periodically rebalance their portfolios. Shareholders who invest in the Fund should actively
	manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.




	 




	The
	hypothetical examples below illustrate how a leveraged fund’s returns can behave for periods longer than a single day, e.g.,
	a fund that seeks to triple the daily performance of benchmark contract. On each day, the Fund performs in line with its objective
	(three times (3x) the benchmark’s daily performance before fees and expenses). Notice that, in the first example where there
	has been an overall benchmark loss for the period, over the entire seven-day period, the Fund’s total return is more than
	three times the loss of the period return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. For the seven-day period, benchmark lost -3.26%
	while the Fund lost -11.19%, not -9.78% (or 3 x -3.26%)).

	Similarly,
	in another example (showing an overall benchmark gain for the period), over the entire seven-day period, the Fund’s total
	return is considerably less than triple that of the period return of the benchmark. For the seven-day period, benchmark gained
	2.72% while the Fund gained 6.37% (versus 8.16% (or 3 x 2.72%)).

	These
	effects are caused by compounding, which exists in all investments, but has a more significant impact on leveraged funds. In general,
	during periods of higher benchmark volatility, compounding will cause the Fund’s results for periods longer than a single
	day to be less than three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract (or for the Short Oil Fund, less than
	three times the inverse (-3x) of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract). This effect becomes more pronounced as volatility
	increases. Conversely, in periods of lower benchmark volatility (particularly when combined with higher Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract returns), the Fund’s returns over longer periods can be higher than three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract. Actual results for a particular period, before fees and expenses, are also dependent on the magnitude of
	the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract return in addition to the Benchmark volatility. These effects may be even greater with the
	United States 3X Short Oil Fund.




	The
	graphs that follow illustrate this point. Each of the graphs shows a simulated hypothetical one year performance of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract compared with the performance of the Fund and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund that perfectly achieves its daily
	investment objective on each day during the period. The graphs demonstrate that, for periods greater than a single day, the Fund
	is likely to underperform or outperform (but not match) the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract performance (or, for the United States 3X
	Short Oil Fund, the inverse of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract) times the multiple stated as the daily Fund objective. Investors
	should understand the consequences of holding a daily rebalanced Fund for periods longer than a single day and should actively
	manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. A one-year period is used solely for illustrative purposes. Deviations
	from the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract return times the Fund multiple can occur over periods as short as two days (each day as
	measured from daily NAV to the next daily NAV) and may also occur in periods shorter than a single day (when measured intraday
	as opposed to daily NAV to the next daily NAV) (see “Calculating Per Share NAV” below for additional details). To
	isolate the impact of daily leveraged, or for the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, inverse leveraged exposure, these graphs assume: a)
	no Fund expenses or transaction costs; b) borrowing/lending rates (to obtain required leveraged or inverse leveraged exposure)
	and cash reinvestment rates of zero percent; and c) the Fund consistently maintaining perfect exposure of 3x or, in the case of
	the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, -3x as of the fund’s NAV calculation time each day. If these assumptions were different,
	each funds’ performance would be different than that shown. If fund expenses, transaction costs and financing expenses greater
	than zero percent were included, each funds’ performance would also be different than shown. Each of the graphs also assumes
	a volatility rate of 33%, which is the approximate five-year historical volatility rate of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	as of December 31, 2016. A benchmark’s volatility rate is a statistical measure of the magnitude of fluctuations in
	its returns. These graphs are presented to provide examples of what can occur if an investor choses to hold the funds for periods
	longer than one-day. They are not intended to suggest that longer holding periods such as one-year are an appropriate holding
	period.

	The graph above shows a scenario
	where the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, which exhibits day-to-day volatility, is flat or trendless over a year (i.e., provides
	a return of 0.1% over the course of the year), but the Fund (3x) and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund (-3x) are both significantly
	down.




	 





	The graph above
	shows a scenario where the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, which exhibits day-to-day volatility, is down over the year, but the
	Fund (3x) is down less than three times the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund (-3x) is up
	significantly less than three times the inverse of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

	The graph above shows a scenario
	where the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, which exhibits day-to-day volatility, is up over the year, but the Fund (3x) is up significantly
	less than three times the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund (-3x) is down less than three
	times the inverse of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




	 




	The tables below illustrate the impact
	of two factors that affect a leveraged fund’s performance: benchmark volatility and benchmark return. Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract volatility is a statistical measure of the magnitude of fluctuations in the returns of a benchmark and is calculated
	as the standard deviation of the natural logarithms of one plus the benchmark return (calculated daily), multiplied by the square
	root of the number of trading days per year (assumed to be 252). The tables show estimated Fund returns for a number of combinations
	of benchmark volatility and benchmark return over a one-year period. To isolate the impact of daily leveraged or inverse leveraged
	exposure, these tables assume: a) no fund expenses or transaction costs; b) borrowing/lending rates of zero percent (to obtain
	required leveraged or inverse leveraged exposure) and cash reinvestment rates of zero percent; c) the Fund consistently maintaining
	perfect 3x, or -3x exposure for the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, as of the Fund’s NAV time each day and d) the volatility of
	the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract remains constant over time. If these assumptions were different, the Fund’s performance
	would be different than that shown. If fund expenses, transaction costs and financing expenses were included, each funds’
	performance would be different than shown. The first table below shows an example in which each fund has an investment objective
	to correspond (before fees and expenses) to three times (3x) the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund might be incorrectly
	expected to achieve a 30% return on a yearly basis if the benchmark return was 10%, absent the effects of compounding. However,
	as the table shows, with a benchmark volatility of 40%, the Fund would return -17.6%. In the charts below, shaded areas represent
	those scenarios where the Fund and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, each discussed in the chart with the investment objective as
	described below, will outperform (i.e., return more than) the benchmark performance times the stated multiple in the investment
	objective of the Fund or the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, as applicable; conversely areas not shaded represent those scenarios
	where the Fund or the United States 3X Short Oil Fund, as applicable, will underperform (i.e., return less than) the benchmark
	performance times the multiple stated as the daily fund objective with respect to the Fund or the United States 3X Short Oil Fund,
	as applicable.

	Other Risks







	NYSE may halt trading
	in the Fund’s shares, which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares.






	The Fund’s
	shares are listed for trading on NYSE under the market symbol “USOU.” Trading in shares may be halted due to market
	conditions or, in light NYSE rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of NYSE, make trading in shares inadvisable.
	In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker”
	rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. Additionally, there can be
	no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the Fund’s shares will continue to be met or will
	remain unchanged.






	The lack of an active
	trading market for the Fund shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in the Fund at the time the investor
	sells the shares.






	Although
	the Fund’s shares are listed and traded on NYSE, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares
	will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the
	investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market
	existed.






	Certain of the Fund’s
	investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.  






	Futures
	positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there
	is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political
	actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil production or exports, or another major export, can also make
	it difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments may be illiquid, the
	Fund’s Oil Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may
	be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated. The large size of the positions that the Fund may acquire
	increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses
	while trying to do so.




	OTC contracts
	that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange,
	do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability
	of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. These
	conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely
	impact the Fund’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce
	counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty
	default since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations.






	The Fund is not actively
	managed and tracks the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.






	The Fund
	is not actively managed by conventional methods. Accordingly, if the Fund’s investments in Oil Interests are declining in
	value, the Fund will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon
	the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract. USCF will seek to cause the NAV of the Fund’s shares to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract during periods
	in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.






	Regulation of the commodity
	interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but
	may significantly and adversely affect the Fund.






	The futures
	markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges
	are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation
	of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing
	modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment
	pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. In addition, various national governments outside of the United States
	have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate
	the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict, but it could
	be substantial and adverse.

	An investment in the
	Fund may provide little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, the Fund may have no gains to offset losses
	from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in the Fund while incurring losses with respect to
	other asset classes.






	Historically,
	Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes
	such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of
	futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.




	However,
	there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, the
	Fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or
	no diversification benefits from an investment in the Fund’s shares. In such a case, the Fund may have no gains to offset
	losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in the Fund at the same time they incur losses
	with respect to other investments.




	Variables
	such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and
	crude oil-linked instruments, including Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
	These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject the Fund’s investments to greater volatility
	than investments in traditional securities.




	Non-correlation
	should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds,
	are negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, the Fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable
	during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.






	Trading in international
	markets could expose the Fund to credit and regulatory risk.






	 The
	Fund invests primarily in Oil Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including
	the NYMEX. However, a portion of the Fund’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Some
	non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. Trading
	on such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S.
	counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections. In trading contracts denominated in currencies
	other than U.S. dollars, the Fund is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional
	currencies of such contracts. Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls,
	expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability. An adverse development
	with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international
	markets.






	USCF’s Limited
	Liability Agreement (“LLC Agreement”) provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director
	of USCF may be removed by USCF’s parent company, Wainwright Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”) which is a wholly
	owned subsidiary of Concierge Technologies Inc. (“Concierge”), a controlled public company where the majority of shares
	are owned by Nicholas Gerber along with certain other family members and certain other shareholders.






	 




	USCF’s
	Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, each of whom are, also executive officers or employees of
	USCF, and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable exchange and SEC
	rules. Under USCF’s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly
	confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management
	Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s Board of Directors. In addition, any Director
	may be removed by written consent of Wainwright Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”), which is the sole member of USCF. The
	sole shareholder of Wainwright is Concierge Technologies Inc., a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol “CNCG”.
	Mr. Nicholas Gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders, own the majority of shares in Concierge,
	which is the sole shareholder of Wainwright, the sole member of USCF. Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board
	of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible
	for Mr. Gerber to exercise his indirect control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management
	Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director. Having control in one person
	could have a negative impact on USCF and the Fund, including their regulatory obligations.

	There is a risk that
	the Fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such the Fund
	may not earn any profit.






	 




	The Fund is contractually
	obligated to pay a management fee to USCF, fees to brokers subject to a cap, and certain expenses regardless of whether the Fund’s
	activities are profitable. Accordingly, the Fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses
	before it can earn any profit.






	Regulation of the commodity
	interests markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly
	and adversely affect the Fund.






	 




	The futures markets
	are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized
	to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative
	position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. Regulation
	of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification
	by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that
	are publicly distributed in the United States. In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed
	concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets and the need to regulate the derivatives
	markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial
	and adverse.






	The Trust is not a registered
	investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.






	 




	The Trust is
	not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute,
	which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship
	between the investment company and its investment manager.




	 




	The Fund will
	seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil that are traded
	on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”).




	 




	The Fund will,
	to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements and/or market conditions:








	(i)




	next
	invest in (a) cleared swap transactions based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
	(b) non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”), negotiated
	swap contracts that are based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and (c) forward
	contracts for oil;





	 


	 


	 









	(ii)




	followed
	by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil,
	gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels, each of which are traded on the
	NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap
	transactions and OTC swap contracts valued based on the foregoing; and






	 








	(iii)




	finally, invest in exchange-traded
	cash settled options on Oil Futures Contracts.





	 


	 


	 





	All such other
	investments are referred to as “Other Oil-Related Investments” and, together with Oil Futures Contracts, are “Oil
	Interests.”




	None of the commodity-based
	derivatives noted above are considered to be “securities” as defined by Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933
	or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Moreover, these types of commodity-based derivatives have not been interpreted as
	being securities under the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the SEC in no action letters or other interpretive notices, or pursuant
	to the jurisdictional accord between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In addition, the cash, cash equivalents
	and Treasuries are not “investment securities” for purposes of determining whether or not an entity is an investment
	company required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, the Fund will not be investing in securities
	and will not be considered an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940.




	 








	21










	 









	The Fund has no operating history
	so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the Fund.






	 




	The Fund is new and has no operating
	history. Therefore, you do not have the benefit of reviewing the past performance of the Fund as a basis to evaluate an investment
	in the Fund. The Sponsor’s current experience involves managing the Related Public Funds. The Sponsor’s results with
	the Related Public Funds may not be directly applicable to the Fund since the Fund has a different investment objective than the
	Related Public Funds.






	The Fund and USCF may
	have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.






	 




	The Fund is subject
	to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers, the Marketing Agent and any Authorized
	Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. These persons are
	directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a conflict
	between their responsibilities to the Fund and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties
	involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the Fund and the shareholders.
	USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good
	faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor
	these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result
	in adverse consequences to the shareholders.




	The Fund
	may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”), including, but not
	limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or
	competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.






	USCF’s officers,
	directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to the Fund and to the Related Public Funds.






	 




	The Fund and
	USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to maintain the Fund’s asset size in order to preserve its
	fee income and this may not always be consistent with the Fund’s objective of having the value of its shares’ NAV
	track, on a leveraged basis, changes in the value of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.




	USCF’s
	officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. For example, USCF’s directors, officers
	and employees act in such capacity for other entities, including the Related Public Funds, that may compete with the Fund for
	their services. Accordingly, they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the Fund and to other entities.




	USCF has
	sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the Fund. This authority to manage the investments and operations
	of the Fund may allow USCF to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors. Shareholders
	have very limited voting rights, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the Trust Agreement, changing
	the Fund’s basic investment objective, dissolving the Fund, or selling or distributing the Fund’s assets.






	The Fund and REX MLPshares, LLC (“REX”) may have conflicts of interest, which may permit REX to
	favor its own interests to the detriment of Fund shareholders.






	REX may
	have conflicts of interest, which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of shareholders. REX’s officers,
	directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund or to REX MLPshares, LLC and also are directors, officers
	or employees of other entities that may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to the Fund and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with REX may have a financial
	incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the Fund and the shareholders. USCF has not established any formal
	procedure to resolve REX conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties
	subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely
	difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Fund’s
	shareholders.




	 








	22










	 









	REX’s officers,
	directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to other entities.






	REX’s
	officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. Rather, REX’s directors, officers and
	employees act in various capacities for other entities, some of which may now, or in the future, compete with the Fund for their
	services. Accordingly, REX’s officers, directors and employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the
	Fund and to other entities.




	USCF has
	sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the Fund. However, REX may act in a way that furthers its own
	interests in conflict with the best interests of investors.






	 








	Investors cannot be
	assured of REX’s continued services, and discontinuance may be detrimental to the Fund.






	 




	Investors cannot
	be assured that REX will be willing or able to continue to service the Fund for any length of time. If REX discontinues its activities
	on behalf of the Fund, the Fund may be adversely affected.






	 








	Shareholders have only very
	limited voting rights and have the power to replace USCF only under specific circumstances. Shareholders do not participate in
	the management of the Fund and do not control USCF, so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect the Fund.






	 




	Shareholders
	have very limited voting rights with respect to the Fund’s affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated
	with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative”
	actions). Shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if USCF resigns voluntarily or loses its charter. Shareholders are
	not permitted to participate in the management or control of the Fund or the conduct of its business. Shareholders must therefore
	rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to manage the Fund’s affairs. For example, the dissolution or resignation of USCF
	would cause the Fund to terminate unless, within 90 days of the event, shareholders holding shares representing at least 66 2/3%
	of the outstanding shares of the Fund elect to continue the Trust and appoint a successor sponsor. In addition, USCF may terminate
	the Fund if it determines that the Fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued
	operation of the Fund unreasonable or imprudent. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s
	termination would result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof, first to creditors and
	then to the shareholders in accordance with their positive book capital account balances, after giving effect to all contributions,
	distributions and allocations for all periods, and the Fund could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a
	termination.






	The Fund could terminate
	at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity
	and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio.






	 




	The Fund could
	terminate at any time, regardless of whether that the Fund has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement. In
	particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the sponsor of the Trust could
	cause the Fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. However, no level of losses
	will require USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s
	investment. Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio.






	An unanticipated number
	of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s NAV.






	 




	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of a block of 50,000 shares (“Redemption Baskets”)
	are received by the Fund during a relatively short period of time, the Fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the Fund
	assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in the Fund’s trading positions
	before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.






	The Fund does not expect
	to make cash distributions.






	 




	The Fund does
	not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Oil Interests rather than distributing
	cash to shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments
	in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors,
	the Fund generally does not expect to distribute cash to shareholders. An investor should not invest in the Fund if the investor
	will need cash distributions from the Fund to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for any other
	reason. Nonetheless, although the Fund does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held
	directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary
	to support its underlying investments in Oil Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving
	distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made.

	Money Market Reform






	The SEC adopted Rule 2a-7 under the
	1940 Act on July 23, 2014, which became effective on October 14, 2016, to reform money market funds (“MMFs”). While
	the new rule applies only to MMFs, it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as Fund. The new rule requires institutional
	prime MMFs to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a “floating
	net asset value per share” or “floating NAV”). Government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized
	cost method to value their portfolio securities. Additionally, liquidity fees and gates allow an MMF’s board of directors
	to directly address runs on a fund. MMFs’ boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent
	runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates (temporary suspension of redemptions). The fees and gates could
	be imposed on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government MMFs.
	The Fund currently plans to invest in government MMFs, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an
	investment for assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts. The Fund does not hold any non-government MMFs
	and, currently, does not anticipate investing in any non-government MMFs. The new rule further decreases the likelihood that the
	Fund would invest in any non-governmental MMFs. However, if the Fund were to make investments in non-government MMFs in the future,
	such investments could negatively impact the Fund because of the changes to MMFs resulting from the new rule.






	The failure or bankruptcy
	of a clearing broker or the Fund’s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of the Fund’s assets and could impair
	the Fund in its ability to execute trades.






	 




	Under CFTC regulations,
	a clearing broker maintains customers’ assets in a bulk segregated account. If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even
	if the customers’ funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial
	deficit in a customer account, the clearing broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their
	funds in the event of that clearing broker’s bankruptcy. In that event, the clearing broker’s customers, such as the
	Fund, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property
	available for distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers. The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result
	in the loss of the Fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker. The Fund may also be subject to the risk of the failure
	of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest
	contracts are traded.




	In addition,
	to the extent the Fund’s clearing broker is required to post the Fund’s assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin
	will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers. If the Fund’s
	clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other customers or otherwise,
	then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by the Fund and any other
	non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.




	From time
	to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. A clearing
	broker’s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from
	the clearing broker’s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute
	and clear the Fund’s trades.




	In addition,
	the majority of the Fund’s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with BBH&Co. (the “Custodian”).
	The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a loss of the Fund’s assets held by the Custodian, which, at any given time,
	could comprise a substantial portion of the Fund’s total assets.






	The liability of USCF
	and the Trustee are limited under the Trust Agreement, and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the Fund is required
	to indemnify the Trustee or USCF.






	 




	Under the Trust
	Agreement, the Trustee and USCF are not liable, and have the right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense incurred absent
	gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee or USCF or breach by USCF of the Trust Agreement, as the case
	may be. As a result, USCF may require the assets of the Fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or
	by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Fund and the value of its shares.




	 








	24










	 









	Although the shares
	of the Fund are limited liability investments, certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the Fund by a shareholder
	will increase the shareholder’s liability.






	 




	The shares of
	the Fund are limited liability investments; shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized
	on their investment. However, shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Fund
	any distribution they received at a time when the Fund was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In addition,
	a number of states do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as the Delaware statutes under which the Trust has
	been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible that a court in such state could hold that, due to the absence of any statutory
	provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation
	on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, are
	not so entitled in such state. Finally, in the event the Trust or the Fund is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation
	or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder’s (or assignee’s)
	obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, such shareholder (or assignees cumulatively)
	is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, for all such liability and expense incurred,
	including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees.




	 






	The Fund is a series of the
	Trust and, as a result, a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the Fund are not segregated from
	those of another series of the Trust, thereby potentially exposing assets in the Fund to the liabilities of another series of
	the Trust.






	 




	The Fund is a
	series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if
	certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate
	and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct
	records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or
	any series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against
	the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely,
	none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable
	against the assets of such series. USCF is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this Inter-Series Limitation on Liability
	or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance. USCF intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the
	Fund and account for the Fund separately from any other series of the Trust, but it is possible a court could conclude that the
	methods used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities
	of another series of the Trust.






	USCF and the Trustee
	are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Fund property.






	 




	Neither USCF
	nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding
	in respect of the Fund property. The Trust Agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action,
	suit or other proceeding.






	Third parties may infringe
	upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual
	property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.






	 




	It is possible
	that third parties might utilize the Fund’s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods,
	trademarks and trading program software, without permission. USCF has a patent for the Fund’s business method and has registered
	its trademarks. The Fund does not currently have any proprietary software. However, if it obtains proprietary software in the
	future, any unauthorized use of the Fund’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive
	advantage. The Fund may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks,
	proprietary software and other technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary
	software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including
	their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the
	future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights, defend itself
	against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights, or defend itself against claims that its
	rights are invalid. Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant
	costs, divert its resources from the Fund, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into
	royalty or licensing agreements.

	Due to the increased
	use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks.


	 




	With the
	increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions,
	the Fund is susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate
	attacks or unintentional events. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
	for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks
	may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks
	on websites. Cyber security failures or breaches of the Fund’s clearing broker or third party service provider (including,
	but not limited to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions
	and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of Fund shareholders to transact business,
	violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation
	costs, and/or additional compliance costs.




	In addition,
	substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its shareholders could be
	negatively impacted as a result. While the Fund has established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such
	plans.





	 









	ADDITIONAL
	INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND, ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND INVESTMENTS





	The Fund is a series of the Trust. The Trust operates pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Declaration
	of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of June 23, 2017 (“Trust Agreement”) which grants full management control
	of the Fund to USCF. The Fund maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California
	94612.




	The Fund
	will seek to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil that are
	traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”).




	 




	The Fund will,
	to a lesser extent and in view of regulatory requirements and/or market conditions:




	 








	(i)




	next
	invest in (a) cleared swap transactions based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
	(b) non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”), negotiated
	swap contracts that are based on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and (c) forward
	contracts for oil;






	 








	(ii)




	followed
	by investments in futures contracts for other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil,
	gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels, each of which are traded on the
	NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe or other U.S. and foreign exchanges as well as cleared swap
	transactions and OTC swap contracts valued based on the foregoing; and






	 








	(iii)




	finally,
	invest in exchange-traded cash settled options on Oil Futures Contracts.





	 


	 


	 





	All such other
	investments are referred to as “Other Oil-Related Investments” and, together with Oil Futures Contracts, are “Oil
	Interests.”




	For the Fund
	to maintain a consistent 300% return versus the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the Fund’s holdings must be rebalanced on
	a daily basis by buying additional Oil Interests or selling Oil Interests that it holds. Such rebalancing will occur generally
	before or at the close of trading of the Shares on the Exchange, at or as near as possible to that day’s settlement price,
	and will be disclosed on the Fund’s website as pending trades before the opening of trading on the Exchange the next business
	day and will be taken into account in the Fund’s intra-day Indicative Fund Value and reflected in the Fund’s end of
	day NAV on that business day

	.





	The Fund
	anticipates that, to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts other than the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or Other Oil-Related
	Investments, it will invest in futures, cleared and non-cleared swaps, and call and put options to hedge the short-term price
	movements of such Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments against the price movements of the current Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract. For example, if the Fund invested in diesel-heating oil futures contracts, it may also enter into a swap
	or forward contract that is valued based on the difference between the diesel-heating oil futures contract and the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract so that the investment in the diesel-heating oil futures contracts together with such swap would provide a return
	that more closely matches the movements in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The daily holdings of the Fund are
	available on the Fund’s website at http://www.uscfinvestments.com.




	 








	26










	 







	The Fund
	invests in Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral
	obligations with respect to its investments in Oil Interests. In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF is the investment
	in futures contracts and the management of the Fund’s investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents for margining
	purposes and as collateral.




	The Fund
	seeks to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will track
	three times (3x) the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms. As a
	specific benchmark, USCF endeavors to place the Fund’s trades in Oil Interests and otherwise manage the Fund’s investments
	so that the difference between “A” and “B” will be plus/minus 0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”,
	where:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	A is the average daily
	percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV for any period of thirty (30) successive valuation days,

	i.e.

	,
	any NYSE trading day as of which the Fund calculates its per share NAV; and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	B is three times the
	average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period.   





	 


	 


	 


	 





	USCF believes
	that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily change in the Fund’s share price on the NYSE exchange on a percentage
	basis to closely track the daily changes in the Fund’s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that the
	daily changes in the Fund’s NAV in percentage terms will track three times (3x) the daily changes in percentage terms in
	the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less the Fund’s expenses.




	The Fund
	will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time

	greater than one day

	. The pursuit of daily
	leveraged investment goals means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance
	to 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for such longer period because the aggregate return of the Fund is
	the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns. During periods of market volatility, the volatility of the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract may affect the Fund’s return as much as or more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract. Further, the return for investors that invest for periods less than a full trading day or for a period different than
	a trading day will not be the product of the return of the Fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the full trading day. Additionally, investors should be aware that the Fund’s investment
	objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Natural
	market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares relative
	to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price
	of the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango
	and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning
	and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)




	 





	The Fund is
	designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment
	results and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate
	for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios.





	  




	The Fund’s
	“neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the Fund’s shares
	for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the oil or other
	industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oil-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective
	of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in crude oil and/or the risks involved in hedging may
	exist. In addition, an investment in the Fund involves the risk that the daily changes in the price of the Fund’s shares,
	in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract on a leveraged basis, in
	percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract in percentage terms, will not closely correlate
	with daily changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil, in percentage terms.







	Impact
	of Contango and Backwardation on Total Returns





	Several
	factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from “rolling” futures contracts
	that will expire at the end of the current month (the “near” or “front” month contract) forward each month
	prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures
	contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract
	is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as “backwardation”), then absent any other
	change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches
	expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation
	referred to as “contango”), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline
	in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.




	 








	27










	 







	Contango
	and backwardation are natural market forces that can impact the total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares relative
	to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of
	the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and
	backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and
	storing crude oil, which could be substantial.




	As an
	example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery (the “spot” price), was $50 per barrel, and the
	value of a position in the near month futures contract was also $50. Over time, the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate
	based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to its supply. The value of the near month contract will
	likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract
	and not take delivery of the oil, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and
	invest in the next month contract.




	If the
	futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next
	month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures
	contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $49 per barrel, or 2% cheaper than the $50 near month futures
	contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship
	between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and
	the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $49 next month futures contract would rise to $50 as it approaches
	expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price
	of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of crude
	oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value
	of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained
	constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.




	If the
	futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near
	month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures
	contract might be $51 per barrel, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no
	other changes, the value of the $51 next month futures contract would fall to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example,
	the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be
	possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount,
	e.g., 12%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures
	contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot
	price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.




	Historically,
	the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly
	as often as contango since oil futures trading, started in 1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of
	2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009, the
	level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the
	physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led
	to unusually high inventories of crude oil. A combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along with growing
	demand for crude oil globally, moderated the inventory build-up and lead to reduced levels of contango by 2011. However, at the
	end of November, 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC decided to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil
	producers, resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango, sometimes steep contango.
	This period of contango continued through December 31, 2016. In addition, the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango
	until U.S. and global oil inventories decline significantly. If OPEC’s recent cuts in oil production have their intended
	effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in 2017.




	Periods
	of contango or backwardation do not materially impact the Fund’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes
	in its per share NAV track, on a leveraged basis, the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the
	Fund’s shares and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation
	or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.

	Trading Methodology





	In managing
	the Fund’s assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders. USCF instead employs a
	quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Oil Interests, such as the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that approximates three times (3x) the amount of Treasuries and/or cash
	received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket. As of the NAV calculation time each trading day, the Fund will also seek to
	position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is consistent with its investment objective
	to provide investment results that correspond (before fees and expenses) to three times (3x) the performance of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract.




	The specific
	Oil Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification
	of the Fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility
	of particular contracts. While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Oil Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including
	the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements
	limiting the Fund’s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Oil Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or
	invest in Other Oil-Related Investments. To the extent that the Fund invests in Other Oil-Related Investments, it would prioritize
	investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including cleared
	swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts,
	instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the “OTC market”).
	If the Fund is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position
	in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions
	dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments, a substantial portion of the Fund’s assets
	could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Oil-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return
	on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. As the Fund’s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits,
	accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such
	priority in Other Oil-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates
	could cause the Fund to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing the Fund to obtain greater liquidity or
	to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See “Risk Factors Involved With an Investment in the Fund” for
	a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on the Fund’s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.




	USCF may
	not be able to fully invest the Fund’s assets in Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly
	equal to three times (3x) the Fund’s NAV. For example, as standardized contracts, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are
	for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and the Fund’s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket
	are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, the Fund may be better
	able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract through the use of Other
	Oil-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract.




	The Fund
	anticipates that to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts other than contracts on light, sweet crude oil (such as futures
	contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Oil-Related Investments, it will enter
	into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Oil Futures Contracts and
	Other Oil-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




	USCF does not anticipate letting the Fund’s Oil Futures Contracts expire and taking, or making, delivery
	of the underlying commodity. Instead, USCF will close existing positions,

	e.g.

	, when it changes the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds
	in new Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets
	and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested.

	The Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract is changed from the near month contract to the next month contract over a four-day period. Each month, the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract changes starting at the end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the near month
	contract for that month. During the first three days of the period, the applicable value of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	is based on a combination of the near month contract and the next month contract as follows: (1) day 1 consists of 75% of
	the then near month contract’s price plus 25% of the price of the next month contract, divided by 75% of the near month
	contract’s prior day’s price plus 25% of the price of the next month contract, (2) day 2 consists of 50% of the
	then near month contract’s price plus 50% of the price of the next month contract, divided by 50% of the near month contract’s
	prior day’s price plus 50% of the price of the next month contract and (3) day 3 consists of 25% of the then near month
	contract’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month contract, divided by 25% of the near month contract’s prior
	day’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month contract. On day 4, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the next month
	contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract until the beginning of the following
	month’s change in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over a four-day period. On each day during the four-day period, USCF
	anticipates it will “roll” the Fund’s positions in Oil Interests by closing, or selling, a percentage of the
	Fund’s positions in Oil Interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those positions in new Oil Interests that reflect
	the change in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




	The anticipated
	dates that the monthly four-day roll period will commence are posted on the Fund’s website at www.uscfinvestments.com, and
	are subject to change without notice.




	By remaining invested as fully as possible in Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments, USCF
	believes that the daily changes in percentage terms of the Fund’s NAV will continue to closely track, on a leveraged basis,
	the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. USCF believes that certain arbitrage
	opportunities result in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE closely tracking the NAV of the Fund. Additionally, Oil Futures
	Contracts traded on the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Based on these expected interrelationships,
	USCF believes that the changes in the price of the Fund’s shares as traded on the NYSE will closely track on a daily basis,
	the changes in the spot price of light, sweet crude oil on a percentage basis.







	What are the Trading Policies
	of the Fund?







	 








	Investment Objectives






	The Fund
	seeks, on a daily basis, to provide investment results that correspond (before fees and expenses) to three times (3x) the performance
	of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than a single
	day. Because the Fund seeks investment results for a single day only (as measured from the time the Fund calculates its NAV to
	the time of the Fund’s next NAV calculation) and on a leveraged basis, the Fund is different from most exchange-traded funds.




	 




	As of the NAV
	calculation time each trading day, the Fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract is consistent with its investment objective. The impact of a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s movements during
	the day will affect whether the Fund’s portfolio needs to be rebalanced. For example, the Fund’s long exposure will
	need to be increased on days when the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract rises and decreased on days the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	falls. Daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time means that the return of the Fund for a period
	longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ
	from three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the period. The Fund may lose money if the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract’s performance is flat over time, and it is possible for a Fund to lose money over time regardless of
	the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, as a result of daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
	volatility and compounding.





	There
	can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or avoid substantial losses. The Fund does not seek to
	achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents
	the Fund from achieving such results. Results for the Fund over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected
	to be a simple multiple (3x) of the period return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and will likely differ significantly from
	such. The Fund may lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s performance is flat over time, and it is possible
	for the Fund to lose money over time regardless of the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, as a result of daily
	rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s volatility and compounding. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment
	returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be
	at least as important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.







	Liquidity






	 




	The Fund invests
	only in Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume
	to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Oil-Related Investments that,
	in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position
	of the Fund.




	 








	30










	 









	Spot Commodities






	 




	While the crude
	Oil Futures Contracts traded can be physically settled, the Fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery. The Fund may
	from time to time trade in Other Oil-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil.






	Leverage






	 




	USCF endeavors
	to have the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments equal
	to three times (3x) the Fund’s total net assets. Commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other
	related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage
	of a futures contract’s (or other commodity interest’s) entire market value.






	Borrowings






	 




	Borrowings are
	not expected to be used by the Fund unless the Fund is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if the Fund
	trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.






	OTC Derivatives (Including
	Spreads and Straddles)






	 




	In addition to
	Oil Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Oil Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market.
	Consequently, the Fund may purchase options on crude Oil Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.




	In addition
	to the Oil Futures Contracts and options on the Oil Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market
	in derivatives tied to crude oil. These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between
	two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded Oil Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Oil
	Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party,

	i.e.

	, the risk that the other
	party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with
	such contracts, the Fund will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published
	by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) that provides for the netting of its overall
	exposure to its counterparty.




	USCF assesses
	or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines
	approved by USCF’s board.




	The Fund
	may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (an “Exchange
	for Related Position” or “EFRP transaction”). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by the
	Fund, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of the Fund shares. These EFRP transactions may expose
	the Fund to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding
	futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.




	The Fund
	may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking,
	on a leveraged basis, the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous
	long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.




	The Fund
	does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange, forward contracts or options on such
	contracts, but it may do so as outlined in the Fund’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations.




	 








	31










	 









	Pyramiding






	 




	USCF has not
	employed, and will not employ, the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on
	existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

	USO:







	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	The
	investment objective of the United States Oil Fund, LP (“USO”) is for the daily changes in percentage terms of
	its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot
	price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified
	short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,”
	less USO’s expenses. USO does not use leverage to meet its objective. 




	 



	USCF manages USO which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and
	the number of outstanding shares for USO.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of USO shares to the public on April 10, 2006 to April 28, 2017, the simple average daily
	changes in relevant benchmark futures contract was (0.041)%, while the simple average daily change in the NAV of USO over the
	same time period was (0.041)%. The average daily difference was (0.000)% (or (0.01) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100
	of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the relevant benchmark futures contract, the average error in daily tracking
	by the NAV was 0.051%, meaning that over this time period USO’s tracking error was within the plus or minus ten percent
	10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.



	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of USO,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between USO’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	The investment
	objective of the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, (“UNG”) is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’
	per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the price of natural gas delivered
	at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract called the
	“Benchmark Futures Contract”, less UNG’s expenses. UNG does not use leverage to meet its objective. 



	USCF manages UNG which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and
	the number of outstanding shares for UNG.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of UNG’s shares to the public on April 18, 2007 to April 28, 2017, the simple average daily
	change in the relevant benchmark futures contract was 0.267%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UNG
	over the same time period was 0.265%. The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.1) basis points, where 1 basis point equals
	1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the relevant benchmark futures contract, the average error in daily tracking
	by the per share NAV was (0.453)% meaning that over this time period UNG’s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10%
	range established as its benchmark tracking goal.

	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of UNG,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between UNG’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	Draw-down:
	Losses experienced by the fund over a specified period. Draw-down is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not
	reflect intra-month figures.




	Worst
	Monthly Percentage Draw-down: The largest single month loss sustained during the most recent five calendar years and year-to-date.




	Worst
	Peak-to-Valley Draw-down: The largest percentage decline in the NAV per share over the history of the fund. This need not be a
	continuous decline, but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive
	returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down represents the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end per share NAV is not
	equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end per share NAV.

	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS




	The investment objective of the United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (“USL”) is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the
	spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices
	of specified short-term futures contracts on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts,” less
	USL’s expenses. USL does not use leverage to meet its objective.



	USCF manages USL which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of USL shares to the public on December 6, 2007 to April 28, 2017, the simple average daily change
	in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts was 0.008%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USL over the
	same time period was 0.006%. The average daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100
	of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, the average error in daily tracking by the
	per share NAV was (0.728)%, meaning that over this time period USL’s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range
	established as its benchmark tracking goal.




	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of USL,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between USL’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the

	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contracts on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contracts, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	UGA:







	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	The investment objective of the United States Gasoline Fund, LP (“UGA”)is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage
	terms of the spot price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or “RBOB”),
	for delivery to the New York harbor, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on
	gasoline called the “Benchmark Futures Contract,” less UGA’s expenses. UGA does not use leverage to meet its
	objective. 




	USCF manages UGA which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and
	the number of outstanding shares for UGA.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of UGA’s shares to the public on February 26, 2008 to April 28, 2017, the simple average
	daily change in the relevant benchmark futures contract was (0.137)% while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV
	of UGA over the same time period was (0.137)%. The average daily difference was (0.001)% (or (0.1) basis points, where 1 basis
	point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the relevant benchmark futures contract, the average error
	in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.812)%, meaning that over this time period UGA’s tracking error was within
	the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.

	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of UGA,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between UGA’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	The

	ending NAV of the previous month, subtracting 1 and multiplying this number by 100 to
	arrive at a percentage increase or decrease.

	Through

	Draw-down: Losses experienced
	over a specified period. Draw-down is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not reflect intra-month figures.




	Worst Monthly Percentage Draw-down:
	The largest single month loss sustained during the most recent five calendar years and year-to-date.




	Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down: The
	largest percentage decline in the NAV per share over the history of the fund. This need not be a continuous decline, but can be
	a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley
	Draw-down represents the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end per share NAV is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent
	month-end per share NAV.




	 






	USCI:







	PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	The investment objective of the United States Commodity Index Fund (“USCI”) is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage
	terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return

	SM

	(the “SDCI”), less USCI’s expenses.
	USCI does not use leverage to meet its objective. 



	USCF manages USCI which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows,
	as of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and
	the number of outstanding shares for USCI. Please note that, prior to May 2012, a Creation Basket was composed of 100,000 shares,
	so the total number of outstanding shares does not reflect the difference between the number of baskets purchased and the number
	of baskets redeemed.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of USCI’s shares to the public on August 10, 2010 to April 28, 2017, the simple average
	daily change in the SDCI was (0.008)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USCI over the same time period
	was (0.004)%. The average daily difference was (0.012)% (or (0.12) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a
	percentage of the daily movement of the SDCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (8.95)%, meaning that
	over this time period USCI’s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking
	goal.

	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of USCI,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between USCI’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	Worst
	Peak-to-Valley Draw-down: The largest percentage decline in the NAV per share over the history of the Fund. This need not be a
	continuous decline, but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive
	returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down represents the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end per share NAV that
	is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end per share NAV.

	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS




	The investment objective of the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP (“BNO”) is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage
	terms of the spot price of Brent crude oil, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract
	on Brent crude oil called the “Benchmark Futures Contract”, less BNO’s expenses. BNO does not use leverage to
	meet its objective.



	USCF manages BNO which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and
	the number of outstanding shares for BNO.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of BNO’s shares to the public on June 2, 2010 to April 28, 2017, the simple average daily
	change in the relevant benchmark futures contract was (0.018)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of
	BNO over the same time period was (0.020)%. The average daily difference was (0.001)% (or (0.1) basis points, where 1 basis point
	equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the relevant benchmark futures contract, the average error in daily
	tracking by the per share NAV was (0.932)% meaning that over this time period BNO’s tracking error was within the plus or
	minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.



	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of BNO,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between BNO’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contracts on natural
	gas called the “Benchmark Futures Contracts”, less UNL’s expenses. UNL does not use leverage to meet its investment

	PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	The investment objective of the United States Short Oil Fund, LP (“DNO”) is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to inversely reflect the daily changes in
	percentage terms of the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing,
	Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract for WTI light, sweet crude oil
	called the “Benchmark Futures Contract,” less DNO’s expenses. DNO does not use leverage to meet its objective. 



	USCF manages DNO which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows, as
	of April 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception and

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of DNO shares to the public on September 24, 2009 to April 28, 2017, the inverse of the simple
	daily change in the relevant benchmark futures contract was 0.012%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV
	of DNO over the same time period was 0.011%. The average daily difference was (0.0003)% (or (0.03) basis points, where 1 basis
	point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the relevant benchmark futures contract, the
	average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.934)%, meaning that over this time period DNO’s tracking error
	was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.




	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of DNO,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between DNO’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	Draw-down:
	Losses experienced over a specified period. Draw-down is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not reflect intra-month
	figures.




	Worst
	Monthly Percentage Draw-down: The largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading.




	Worst
	Peak-to-Valley Draw-down: The largest percentage decline in the NAV per share over the history of the Fund. This need not be a
	continuous decline, but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive
	returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down represents the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end per share NAV that
	is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end per share NAV.






	CPER:







	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS




	The investment objective of the United States Copper Index Fund (“CPER”) is for the daily changes
	in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage
	terms of the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return

	SM

	(the “SCI”), less CPER’s expenses. CPER does
	not use leverage to meet its objective.


	 


	USCF manages CPER which is a commodity pool that issues shares traded on the NYSE. The chart below shows,
	as of February 28, 2017, the number of Authorized Participants, the total number of baskets created and redeemed since inception
	and the number of outstanding shares for CPER.

	Since
	the commencement of the offering of CPER’s shares to the public on November 15, 2011 to April 28, 2017, the simple average
	daily change in the SCI was (0. 096)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of CPER over the same time period
	was (0.101)%. The average daily difference was (0.004)% (or (0.4) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a
	percentage of the daily movement of the SCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (4.44)%, meaning that
	over this time period CPER’s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking
	goal.






	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of CPER,
	since inception through April 28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between CPER’s closing market
	price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the
	end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of
	day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time while
	regular trading in the relevant benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the
	relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	Draw-down:
	Losses experienced over a specified period. Draw-down is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not reflect intra-month
	figures.




	Worst
	Monthly Percentage Draw-down: The largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading.




	Worst
	Peak-to-Valley Draw-down: The largest percentage decline in the NAV per share over the history of CPER. This need not be a continuous
	decline, but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns.
	Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down represents the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end per share NAV that is not equaled
	or exceeded by a subsequent month-end per share NAV.

	certain other REX Funds. In addition, REX works with USCF to develop the investment methodology for the REX Funds, provide the
	appropriate benchmarks for the REX Funds, and assist in determining the strategy for satisfying the investment methodology. For
	certain other REX Funds, which do not include the Fund, REX will assist USCF in obtaining a license or sub-license for the applicable
	REX Funds, as needed, with respect to any relevant index.




	USCF
	will pay a monthly fee to REX for services provided to the Fund that will be calculated according to the following formula (the
	“Monthly Fee”):




	Monthly
	Fee = (A-B) x C




	For
	purposes of calculating the Monthly Fee:




	“A”
	equals the Management Fee payable by the Fund to USCF during the applicable calendar month; and,




	“B”
	equals the amount of the Manager Expenses payable during the applicable calendar month where (i) “Manager Expenses”
	means: (a) all direct expenses incurred by USCF in connection with formation and operation of the Trust and the Fund, as set forth
	in the trust agreement for the Trust, (b) all expenses, including Fund Expenses, reimbursed by USCF to the Fund, and (c) such
	other expenses as REX and USCF may agree from time to time to designate as “Manager Expenses” provided that, for the
	avoidance of doubt, “Manager Expenses” shall specifically exclude Management Fees, and (ii) “Fund Expenses”
	means (a) the Management Fee payable to USCF, (b) brokerage fees, futures commission merchant fees and other fees and commissions
	incurred in connection with the trading activities of the Fund, (c) any costs and expenses related to registration of additional
	shares of the Fund, and (d) all other expenses allocated to the Fund by USCF in consultation with REX; and




	“C”
	equals 40%.




	In any
	month where “A” minus “B” equals zero (0) or a number less than zero (0), then the amount of the Monthly
	Fee paid to REX for such month shall be zero. USCF will pay the Monthly Fee on behalf of the Fund to REX on a monthly basis within
	thirty business days of the end of each calendar month.

	$75,000. USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.




	 




	BBH&Co.’s

	Delaware Trustee





	 



	Wilmington Trust, National Association, a national banking association, with its principal place of business
	in the State of Delaware, as Delaware trustee (the “Trustee”) serves as the Trust’s corporate trustee as required
	under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”). USCF pays the Trustee $3,000
	annually for its services to the Trust.



	The Trustee
	is the sole trustee of the Trust. The rights and duties of the Trustee and USCF with respect to the offering of the shares and
	the Fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the DSTA and by the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will
	accept service of legal process on the Trust in the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the DSTA. The Trustee
	does not owe any other duties to the Trust, USCF or the shareholders of the Fund. The Trustee’s principal offices are located
	at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19890. The Trustee is unaffiliated with USCF.




	 




	The Trustee is
	permitted to resign upon at least sixty (60) days’ notice to the Trust, provided, that any such resignation will not
	be effective until a successor Trustee is appointed by USCF. USCF has the discretion to replace the Trustee.




	Only the
	assets of the Trust and USCF are subject to issuer liability under the federal securities laws for the information contained in
	this prospectus and under federal securities laws with respect to the issuance and sale of the shares. Under such laws, neither
	the Trustee, either in its capacity as Trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer or controlling person
	of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer or a director, officer or controlling person of the issuer of the Shares.
	The Trustee’s liability in connection with the issuance and sale of the shares is limited solely to the express obligations
	of the Trustee set forth in the Trust Agreement.




	Under
	the Trust Agreement, USCF has exclusive management and control of all aspects of the Trust’s business. The Trustee has no
	duty or liability to supervise the performance of USCF, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of USCF.
	The shareholders have no voice in the day to day management of the business and operations of the Fund and the Trust, other than
	certain limited voting rights as set forth in the Trust Agreement. In the course of its management of the business and affairs
	of the Fund and the Trust, USCF may, in its sole and absolute discretion, appoint an affiliate or affiliates of USCF as additional
	sponsors and retain such persons, including affiliates of USCF, as it deems necessary to effectuate and carry out the purposes,
	business and objectives of the Trust.




	Because
	the Trustee has no authority over the Trust’s operations, the Trustee itself is not registered in any capacity with the
	CFTC.







	Marketing Agent





	 




	The Fund
	also employs ALPS Distributors, Inc. (“ALPS Distributors”) as the Marketing Agent, which is further discussed
	under “What is the Plan of Distribution?” USCF pays the Marketing Agent a fee for its services as marketing agent
	to the Fund equal to 0.06% on Fund assets up to the first $3 billion; and 0.04% on Fund assets in excess of $3 billion. In no
	event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for marketing and/or
	distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds
	of the offering.




	 




	ALPS
	Distributors’ principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer
	registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
	and Securities Investor Protection Corporation.






	Relationship with Charles Schwab &
	Co., Inc.




	 



	USCF or the Marketing Agent, or an affiliate
	of USCF or the Marketing Agent, may directly or indirectly make cash payments to certain broker-dealers for participating in activities
	that are designed to make registered representatives and other professionals more knowledgeable about exchange-traded funds and
	exchange-traded products, including the Fund and the Related Public Funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing
	activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting
	systems. USCF and/or the Marketing Agent have, or may in the future have, arrangements to make payments, other than for the educational
	programs and marketing activities described above, to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”). Pursuant to the arrangement
	between USCF and Schwab, Schwab has agreed to promote certain exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products to Schwab’s
	customers, which may include the Fund and certain of the Related Public Funds, and not to charge certain of its customers any commissions
	when those customers purchase or sell shares of participating exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products. Payments to a
	broker-dealer or intermediary may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker-dealer or intermediary and its clients.
	These amounts, which may be significant, are paid by USCF and/or the Marketing from their own resources and not from the assets
	of the Fund or the Related Public Funds.






	Futures Commission Merchant





	 




	The Fund, has
	entered into an agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBC Capital” or “RBC”) whereby RBC will serve
	as a Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”) for the Fund. RBC Capital’s primary address is 3 World Financial Center
	200 Vesey St. New York, New York 10281. RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with
	the CFTC as a FCM. RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.




	 




	Although RBC,
	in its capacity as Broker-Dealer and/or FCM, has been subject to regulatory disciplinary matters involving fines or other sanctions,
	as of the date hereof neither RBC nor any of its principals has been the subject of any material administrative, civil or criminal
	action, including any action that has been pending, on appeal, or concluded within the last five years, except as follows:

	RBC FCM Litigation Disclosure





	 




	RBC is a large
	broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, certain of RBC’s regulators
	may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC with respect
	to issues raised in various investigations. RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in
	all settlements it reaches. In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions,
	a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both
	in regard to such claims and investigations. RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments
	made against it.




	 




	RBC has been
	named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described
	below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include
	claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. RBC is also involved,
	in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding
	RBC’s business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse
	judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.




	 




	RBC contests
	liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting
	the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations
	and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or
	if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other
	relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel,
	that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.




	 




	On June 18, 2015,
	in connection with the SEC’s Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) initiative, the SEC commenced and settled
	an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital Markets, LLC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted
	inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing
	the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings. RBC Capital
	paid a fine of $500,000.




	 




	RBC and certain
	affiliates were named as defendants in a lawsuit relating to their role in transactions involving investments made by a number
	of Wisconsin school districts in certain collateralized debt obligations. These transactions were also the subject of a regulatory
	investigation, which was resolved in 2011. RBC reached a final settlement with all parties in the civil litigation, and the civil
	action against RBC was dismissed with prejudice on December 6, 2016.




	 




	Various regulators
	are conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of law by a number of banks and other entities, including RBC, regarding
	foreign exchange trading. Since 2015, RBC is a named defendant, along with many other entities, in pending putative class actions
	in the U.S. and Canada regarding foreign exchange trading. Based on the facts currently known, the ultimate resolution of these
	collective matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on RBC.




	 




	On April 13,
	2015, RBC’s affiliate, Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas), was charged in France with complicity
	in tax fraud. RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court. The
	trial of this matter has concluded and a verdict was delivered on January 12, 2017, acquitting the company and the other defendants.




	 




	Thornburg Mortgage
	Inc. (now known as TMST) and RBC were parties to a master repurchase agreement executed in September 2003 whereby TMST financed
	its purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities. Upon TMST’s default during the financial crisis, RBC valued TMST’s
	collateral at allegedly deflated prices. After TMST’s bankruptcy filing, TMST’s trustee brought suit against RBC in
	2011 for breach of contract. In 2015, TMST was awarded more than $45 million in damages. RBC has appealed. The appeals court set
	a briefing schedule and simultaneously ordered the parties to participate in a mediation. The parties have subsequently reached
	an agreement to settle the matter; a motion to approve the settlement was filed with the bankruptcy court on January 10, 2016.

	On October 14,
	2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery) in a class action brought by former shareholders of Rural/Metro Corporation,
	held RBC Capital Markets, LLC liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by three Rural/Metro directors, but did
	not make an additional award for attorney’s fees. A final judgment was entered on February 19, 2015 in the amount of US$93
	million plus post judgment interest. RBC appealed the Court of Chancery’s determination of liability and quantum of damages,
	and the plaintiffs cross-appealed the ruling on additional attorneys’ fees. On November 30, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court
	affirmed the Court of Chancery with respect to both the appeal and cross-appeal. RBC is cooperating with an investigation by the
	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to this matter. In particular, the SEC contended that RBC caused materially false
	and misleading information to be included in the proxy statement that Rural filed to solicit shareholder approval for the sale
	in violation of section 14(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14A-9 thereunder. On August 31, 2016, RBC was ordered by the SEC to
	cease and desist and paid $500,000 in disgorgement, plus interest of $77,759 and a civil penalty of $2 million.




	 




	On March 11,
	2013, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which alleged
	that RBC failed to follow its own procedures with respect to monthly account reviews and failed to maintain copies of the monthly
	account reviews with respect to certain accounts that James Hankins Jr. maintained at the firm in violation of N.J.S.A. 49:3-58(a)(2)(xi)
	and 49:3-59(b). Without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, RBC consented to a civil monetary penalty
	of $150,000 (of which $100,000 was suspended as a result of the firm’s cooperation) and to pay disgorgement of $300,000.




	 




	On June 12, 2012,
	the State of Illinois Secretary of State Securities Department consented to entry of a judgment enjoining the firm for violation
	of the Illinois Securities Law of 1953. RBC undertook to repurchase auction rate securities from certain customers before June
	30, 2009. RBC also undertook to use best efforts to provide, by December 31, 2009, liquidity opportunities for customers ineligible
	for the buyback. RBC undertook to provide periodic reports to regulator. RBC paid a penalty of $1,400,139.82.




	 




	On May 10, 2012,
	FINRA commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC for violations of FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010 and NASD Rules
	2110 and 3010 for failing to establish, maintain and enforce written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance
	with applicable rules concerning short-term transactions in closed end funds. RBC paid a fine of $200,000.




	 




	On May 2, 2012,
	the Massachusetts Securities Division entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which alleged
	that RBC recommended unsuitable products to its brokerage and advisory clients and failed to supervise its registered representatives’
	sales of inverse and leveraged ETFs in violation of Section 204(a)(2) of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (“MUSA”).
	Without admitting or denying the allegations of fact, RBC consented to permanently cease and desist from violations of MUSA, pay
	restitution of $2.9 million to the investors who purchased the inverse and leveraged ETFs and pay a civil monetary penalty of
	$250,000.

	The Fund is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on daily net assets and paid monthly
	of 1.35% per annum on average net assets. Average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total net
	assets of the Fund over the calendar year,

	i.e.

	, the sum of daily total net assets divided by the number of calendar days
	in the year. On days when markets are closed, the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was
	open.





	 


	 





	(2)




	The Fund determined this estimate as follows based on the Fund having two Creation Baskets sold and 100,000
	shares outstanding. Assuming the price of a share is $25.00, the Fund would receive $2,500,000 upon the sale of a Creation Basket
	(100,000 shares multiplied by $25.00). Assuming no change in the settlement price of the contracts, the Fund would be required
	to sell and purchase positions in 150 futures contracts each month to support shares sold in the Creation Basket ($2,500,000 divided
	by the total value of the futures contracts at an assumed settlement price for the futures contract of $50,000, multiplied by 3
	for the leverage). Assuming futures commission merchants charge approximately $3.22 per futures contract for each buy or sale,
	the monthly futures commission merchant commission charge per contract would be approximately $6.44 (except on the first month
	in which it would be approximately $3.22 because there is no roll), and the annual futures commission merchant commission charge
	per contract would be approximately $74.06. Assuming no change in the settlement price of the contracts, the Fund would sell and
	buy 150 futures contracts each month to support a Creation Basket, which means that the Fund’s annual commission charge per
	two Creation Baskets without rebalancing would be approximately $11,109 (150 contracts bought and sold * approximately $6.44 per
	month * 11.5 months). The estimated daily rebalancing cost of 1% of holdings is $1,217 (1% * 150 contracts * 252, the number of
	NYSE trading days * $3.22). The Fund’s annual commission charge per two Creation Baskets with rebalancing is $12,326 (the
	annual commission charge plus the rebalancing cost). As a percentage of the total investment of $2,500,000 to support the issuance
	of two Creation Baskets, the Fund’s annual commission expense would be approximately 0.49% ($12,326 divided by $2,500,000
	per annum).






	 







	Breakeven Analysis





	 




	The breakeven
	analysis below indicates the approximate dollar returns and percentage required for the redemption value of a hypothetical investment
	in a single share of the Fund to equal the amount invested twelve months after the investment was made. For purposes of this breakeven
	analysis, an initial selling price per share of $25.00 is assumed. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares to break even
	over the next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $25.00 per share, the investment would have to generate a 0.91% or $0.23
	return. This breakeven analysis refers to the redemption of baskets by Authorized Participants and is not related to any gains
	an individual investor would have to achieve in order to break even. The breakeven analysis is an approximation only.

	resolve these conflicts of interest adequately, it may impact the Fund’s and the Related Public Funds’ ability to
	achieve their investment objectives.




	The officers,
	directors and employees of USCF do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. These persons are directors, officers or employees
	of other entities which may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to the Fund and to those other entities.




	USCF has
	adopted policies that prohibit it and its principals, officers, directors and employees from trading futures and related contracts
	in which either the Fund or any of the Related Public Funds invests. These policies are intended to prevent conflicts of interest
	occurring where USCF or its principals, officers, directors or employees could give preferential treatment to their own accounts
	or trade their own accounts ahead of or against the Fund or any of the Related Public Funds.




	USCF has
	sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the Fund, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers
	its own interests which may create a conflict with your best interests. Shareholders have very limits voting rights, which will
	limit their ability to influence matters such as amendment of the Trust Agreement, change in the Fund’s basic investment
	policy, dissolution of the Trust, or the sale or distribution of the Fund’s assets.




	USCF serves
	as the sponsor to the Trust, the Fund, and the other REX Funds that are series of the Trust, USCF is also the general partner
	or sponsor to the Related Public Funds, USCIFT and UCCO. USCF may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for
	the Fund may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages.




	In addition,
	USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of the Related Public Funds, if the need for indemnification arises.
	This potential indemnification will cause USCF’s assets to decrease. If USCF’s other sources of income are not sufficient
	to compensate for the indemnification, then USCF may terminate and you could lose your investment.




	 




	The officers,
	directors and employees of REX do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. These persons are directors, officers or employees
	of other entities which may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to the Fund and to those other entities.




	REX has
	adopted policies that prohibit it and its principals, officers, directors and employees from trading futures and related contracts
	in which the Fund invests. These policies are intended to prevent conflicts of interest occurring where REX or its principals,
	officers, directors or employees could give preferential treatment to their own accounts or trade their own accounts ahead of
	or against the Fund.






	Resolution of Conflicts
	Procedures






	 




	The Trust Agreement
	provides that whenever a conflict of interest exists between USCF or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust, the
	Fund or any shareholders or any other person, on the other hand, USCF shall resolve such conflict of interest considering the
	relative interest of each party (including its own interest) and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary
	or accepted industry practices, and any applicable accepted accounting practices or principles.

	Interests of Named Experts
	and Counsel






	 




	USCF has employed
	Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP to prepare this prospectus. None of Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP, any other law firm nor any other
	expert hired by USCF on behalf of the Trust and the Fund, to give advice on the preparation of this offering document has been
	hired on a contingent fee basis. Nor does any such party have any present or future expectation of interest in USCF, Marketing
	Agent, Authorized Participants, Custodian, Administrator or other service providers to the Trust and the Fund.







	Ownership or Beneficial
	Interest in the Fund





	 




	As of
	the date of this prospectus USCF owns 40 shares of the Fund.







	Fiduciary and Regulatory
	Duties of USCF





	 




	The general fiduciary
	duties which would otherwise be imposed on USCF (which would make its operation of the Trust as described herein impracticable
	due to the strict prohibition imposed by such duties on, for example, conflicts of interest on behalf of a fiduciary in its dealings
	with its beneficiaries), are replaced by the terms of the Trust Agreement (to which terms all shareholders, by subscribing to
	the shares, are deemed to consent).




	Additionally,
	under the Trust Agreement USCF has the following obligations as a sponsor of the Trust:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	Devote to the business
	and affairs of the Trust such of its time as it determines in its discretion (exercised in good faith) to be necessary to
	conduct the business and affairs of the Trust for the benefit of the Trust and the shareholders;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Execute, file, record

	the formation, qualification and operation of the Trust and for the conduct of its business in all appropriate jurisdictions;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Appoint and remove
	independent public accountants to audit the accounts of the Trust and employ attorneys to represent the Trust;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Use its best efforts
	to maintain the status of the Trust as a statutory trust for state law purposes and as a partnership for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Invest, reinvest,
	hold uninvested, sell, exchange, write options on, lease, lend and, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, pledge,
	mortgage and hypothecate the assets of the Fund in accordance with the purposes of the Trust and this prospectus;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Have fiduciary responsibility
	for the safekeeping and use of the Trust’s assets, whether or not in USCF’s immediate possession or control;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Enter into and perform
	agreements with each Authorized Participant, receive from Authorized Participants and process properly submitted purchase
	orders, receive Creation Basket Deposits, deliver or cause the delivery of Creation Baskets to for the account of the Authorized
	Participant submitting a purchase order;






	 






	 




	•

	•




	 




	Interact with the
	Depository as required;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Delegate duties to
	one or more administrators, as USCF determines; and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Delegate duties to
	one or more commodity trading or other advisors, as USCF determines.






	 




	To the extent
	that, at law (common or statutory) or in equity, USCF has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto
	to the Trust, the Fund, the shareholders or to any other person, USCF will not be liable to the Trust, the Fund, the shareholders
	or to any other person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of the Trust Agreement or this prospectus unless such reliance
	constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of USCF.




	 








	59










	 











	Under
	Delaware law, a beneficial owner of a statutory trust (such as a shareholder of the Fund) may, under certain circumstances, institute
	legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated beneficial owners (a “class action”) to recover
	damages for violations of fiduciary duties, or on behalf of a statutory trust (a “derivative action”) to recover damages
	from a third party where there has been a failure or refusal to institute proceedings to recover such damages. In addition, beneficial
	owners may have the right, subject to certain legal requirements, to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights
	under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC. Beneficial owners who have
	suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses from
	USCF where the losses result from a violation by USCF of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.




	Under
	certain circumstances, shareholders also have the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (a
	registered commodity pool operator), an FCM, as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered
	under the CEA, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Private rights of action are conferred by the CEA. Investors
	in futures and in commodity pools may, therefore, invoke the protections provided thereunder.




	The foregoing
	summary describing in general terms the remedies available to shareholders under federal law is based on statutes, rules and decisions
	as of the date of this Prospectus. As this is a rapidly developing and changing area of the law, shareholders who believe that
	they may have a legal cause of action against any of the foregoing parties should consult their own counsel as to their evaluation
	of the status of the applicable law at such time.







	Liability and Indemnification





	 




	Under the Trust
	Agreement, USCF, the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, “Covered Persons”) (i) shall have
	no liability to the Trust, to the Fund, or to any shareholder for any loss suffered by the Trust or the Fund which arises out
	of any action or inaction of such Covered Person and (ii) shall not be personally liable for the return or repayment of all
	or any portion of the capital or profits of any shareholder or assignee thereof, in both cases, provided that such Covered Person,
	in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interest of the Trust or the Fund and such course of conduct
	did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Covered Person. A Covered Person shall not be liable for the
	conduct or willful misconduct of any Administrator or other delegatee selected by USCF with reasonable care, provided, however,
	that the Trustee and its affiliates shall not, under any circumstances be liable for the conduct or willful misconduct of any
	Administrator or other delegatee or any other person selected by USCF to provide services to the Trust.




	The Trust
	Agreement also provides that USCF (and any other Covered Person performing services on behalf of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable,
	and acting within the scope of USCF’s authority as set forth in the Trust Agreement) shall be indemnified by the Trust (or
	by the Fund separately to the extent the matter in question relates to a single fund or disproportionately affects a specific
	fund in relation to another fund) against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims
	sustained by it in connection with its activities for the Trust or a fund, as applicable, provided that (i) USCF was acting
	on behalf of or performing services for the Trust or a fund, as applicable, and has determined, in good faith, that such course
	of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust or a fund, as applicable and such liability or loss was not the result of gross
	negligence, willful misconduct, or a breach of the Trust Agreement on the part of USCF and (ii) any such indemnification
	will only be recoverable from the assets of the Trust or of the Fund. All rights to indemnification permitted under the Trust
	Agreement shall not be affected by the dissolution or other cessation to exist of USCF, or the withdrawal, adjudication of bankruptcy
	or insolvency of USCF, or the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
	by or against USCF.




	 




	USCF shall not
	be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of the U.S. federal or state
	securities laws unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities
	law violations as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without
	limitation, litigation costs), (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent
	jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation,
	litigation cost) or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against a particular indemnitee
	and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made.




	The payment
	of any indemnification shall be allocated, as appropriate, among the series funds in the Trust, including the Fund. The Trust
	and its series shall not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance which insures any party against any liability, the indemnification
	of which is prohibited under the Trust Agreement.




	 








	60










	 









	Expenses
	incurred in defending a threatened or pending civil, administrative or criminal action, suit or proceeding against USCF shall
	be paid by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if (i) the legal action relates
	to the performance of duties or services by USCF on behalf of the Trust or any fund, as applicable; (ii) the legal action
	is initiated by a party other than the Trust or any fund; and (iii) USCF undertakes to repay the advanced funds with interest
	to the Trust or any fund, as applicable, in cases in which it is not entitled to indemnification under the Trust Agreement.




	In the
	event the Trust or any fund, as applicable, is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any
	loss, liability, damage, cost or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder’s (or assignee’s) obligations
	or liabilities unrelated to the business of the Trust or any fund, as applicable, such shareholder (or assignees cumulatively)
	is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse or such fund, as applicable, for all such
	loss, liability, damage, cost and expense incurred, including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees.




	The Trustee
	will not be liable or accountable to the Trust or to any other person or under any other agreement to which the Trust is a party,
	except for the Trustee’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. USCF also indemnifies the Trustee (in its capacity
	as Trustee and individually) and its successors, assigns, legal representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
	agents and servants from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding taxes
	payable by the Trustee on or measured by any compensation received by the Trustee for its services hereunder or any indemnity
	payments received by the Trustee under the Trust Agreement), claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (including
	reasonable legal fees and expenses) in any way relating to or arising out of the formation, operation or termination of the Trust,
	the execution, delivery and performance of any other agreements to which the Trust is a party or the action or inaction of the
	Trustee, except for expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the indemnified parties.







	Provisions of Law





	 




	According to
	applicable law, indemnification of USCF is payable only if USCF determined, in good faith, that the act, omission or conduct that
	gave rise to the claim for indemnification was in the best interest of the Trust and the Fund and the act, omission or activity
	that was the basis for such loss, liability, damage, cost or expense was not the result of negligence or misconduct and such liability
	or loss was not the result of negligence or misconduct by USCF, and such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable
	only out of the assets of the Fund.






	Provisions of Federal
	and State Securities Laws






	 




	This offering
	is made pursuant to federal and state securities laws. The SEC and state securities agencies take the position that indemnification
	of USCF that arises out of an alleged violation of such laws is prohibited unless certain conditions are met.




	 




	These conditions
	require that no indemnification of USCF or any underwriter for the Fund may be made in respect of any losses, liabilities or expenses
	arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws unless: (i) there has been a successful adjudication
	on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the party seeking indemnification and the court
	approves the indemnification; (ii) such claim has been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction
	as to the party seeking indemnification; or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against
	the party seeking indemnification and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made, provided
	that, before seeking such approval, USCF or other indemnitee must apprise the court of the position held by regulatory agencies
	against such indemnification. These agencies are the SEC and the securities administrator of the State or States in which the
	plaintiffs claim they were offered or sold interests.






	Provisions of the 1933
	Act and NASAA Guidelines






	 




	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act may be permitted to USCF or its directors, officers, or persons controlling the Trust
	and the Fund, the Trust has been informed that the SEC and the various State administrators believe that such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (“NASAA”)
	commodity pool guidelines and is therefore unenforceable.




	 








	61











	 














	Management; Voting by Shareholders





	 




	The shareholders
	of the Fund take no part in the management or control, and have no voice in the Trust’s operations or business. USCF generally
	has the right to amend the Trust Agreement as it applies to the Trust provided that the shareholders have the right to vote only
	if expressly required under Delaware or federal law or rules or regulations of the Exchange, or if submitted to the shareholders
	by USCF in its sole discretion. No amendment affecting the Trustee shall be binding upon or effective against the Trustee unless
	consented to by the Trustee in the form of an instruction letter.







	Meetings





	 




	Meetings of the
	Trust’s shareholders may be called by USCF and may be called by it upon the written request of shareholders holding at least
	50% of the outstanding shares of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable. USCF shall deposit in the United States mail or electronically
	transmit written notice to all shareholders of the Fund of the meeting and the purpose of the meeting, which shall be held on
	a date not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the date of mailing of such notice, at a reasonable time and place. Where
	the meeting is called upon the written request of the shareholders such written notice shall be mailed or transmitted not more
	than 45 days after such written request for a meeting was received by USCF. Any notice of meeting shall be accompanied by a description
	of the action to be taken at the meeting. Shareholders may vote in person or by proxy at any such meeting.




	Any action
	required or permitted to be taken by shareholders by vote may be taken without a meeting by written consent setting forth the
	actions so taken. Such written consents shall be treated for all purposes as votes at a meeting. If the vote or consent of any
	shareholder to any action of the Trust, the Fund or any shareholder, as contemplated by the Trust Agreement, is solicited by USCF,
	the solicitation shall be effected by notice to each shareholder given in the manner provided in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
	The Trust Agreement provides that shareholders are deemed to have consented to any proposals recommended by USCF in the shareholder
	notice unless such shareholders timely object to the proposals. Therefore, a lack of a response by a shareholder will have the
	same effect as if that shareholder had provided affirmative written consent for the proposed action. USCF and all parties dealing
	with the Trust may act in reliance on such deemed activity.




	 







	Termination Events





	 




	The Trust will
	dissolve at any time upon the happening of any of the following events:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	The filing of a certificate
	of dissolution or revocation of USCF’s charter (and the expiration of 90 days after the date of notice to USCF of revocation
	without a reinstatement of its charter) or upon written notice by USCF of its withdrawal as Sponsor, unless (i) at the
	time there is at least one remaining Sponsor and that remaining Sponsor carries on the business of the Trust or (ii) within
	90 days of such event of withdrawal all the remaining shareholders agree in writing to continue the business of the Trust
	and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Sponsors. If the Trust is terminated as the result
	of an event of withdrawal and a failure of all remaining shareholders to continue the business of the Trust and to appoint
	a successor Sponsor as provided above within 120 days of such event of withdrawal, shareholders holding shares representing
	at least a majority (over 50%) of the net asset value (not including shares held by USCF and its affiliates) may elect to
	continue the business of the Trust by forming a new statutory trust, or reconstituted trust, on the same terms and provisions
	as set forth in the Trust Agreement. Any such election must also provide for the election of a Sponsor to the reconstituted
	trust. If such an election is made, all shareholders of the Trust shall be bound thereby and continue as shareholders of the
	reconstituted trust.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The occurrence of
	any event which would make unlawful the continued existence of the Trust.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	In the event of the
	suspension, revocation or termination of USCF’s registration as a commodity pool operator, or membership as a commodity
	pool operator with the NFA (if, in either case, such registration is required at such time unless at the time there is at
	least one remaining Sponsor whose registration or membership has not been suspended, revoked or terminated).






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The Trust becomes
	insolvent or bankrupt.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The shareholders holding
	shares representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the net asset value (which excludes the shares of USCF) vote
	to dissolve the Fund, notice of which is sent to USCF not less than ninety (90) business days prior to the effective
	date of termination.





	 







	62










	 









	 




	•




	 




	The determination
	of USCF that the aggregate net assets of the Fund in relation to the operating expenses of the Trust make it unreasonable
	or imprudent to continue the business of the Trust.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The Trust is required
	to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and USCF does not deem it advisable to
	register the Trust as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.






	 






	 




	•




	 




	DTC is unable or unwilling
	to continue to perform its functions, and a comparable replacement is unavailable.





	 


	 


	 


	 








	Books and Records





	 




	The Trust and
	the Fund keep their books of record and account at the office of USCF located at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA,
	94612, or at the offices of the Administrator located at 50 Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110, or such office,
	including of an administrative agent, as it may subsequently designate upon notice. These books and records are open to inspection
	by any person who establishes to the Trust’s satisfaction that such person is a shareholder upon reasonable advance notice
	at all reasonable times during usual business hours of the Trust and the Fund.







	The Trust keeps a copy of the Trust Agreement
	on file in USCF’s office which will be available for inspection by any shareholder at all times during its usual business
	hours upon reasonable advance notice. Pool participants will not be permitted to review records of proprietary accounts traded
	by USCF or its principles, or any policies related thereto.







	 







	Statements, Filings, and Reports
	to Shareholders





	 




	At the end of
	each fiscal year, the Trust will furnish to DTC Participants for distribution to each person who is a shareholder at the end of
	the fiscal year an annual report containing the Trust’s audited financial statements and other information about the Trust
	and the Fund. USCF is responsible for the registration and qualification of the shares under the federal securities laws and federal
	commodities laws and any other securities and blue sky laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction as USCF may select.
	USCF is responsible for preparing all reports required by the SEC, NYSE and the CFTC, but has entered into an agreement with the
	Administrator to prepare these reports as required by the SEC, the CFTC and NYSE on the Trust’s behalf.




	The financial
	statements of the Trust will be audited, as required by law and may be directed by USCF, by an independent registered public accounting
	firm designated from time to time by USCF. The accountants’ report will be furnished by the Trust to shareholders upon request.
	The Trust will make such elections, file such tax returns, and prepare, disseminate and file such tax reports, as it is advised
	by its counsel or accountants are from time to time required by applicable statute, rule or regulation.




	In addition
	to periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
	current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be assessed on the SEC’s website at

	www.sec.gov

	or on the Fund’s
	website at http://www.uscfinvestments.com, the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement, will provide the following reports to shareholders
	in the manner prescribed below:





	Annual
	Reports

	. Within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, USCF shall cause to be delivered an annual report containing the
	following:




	 






	 




	(i)





	financial statements of the
	Trust, including without limitation, a balance sheet as of the end of the of the Trust’s fiscal year and statements
	of income, Trust’s equity and changes in financial position, for such fiscal year, which shall be prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America consistently applied and shall be audited
	by a firm of independent certified public accountants registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,




	 







	 




	(ii)





	a general description of
	the activities of the Trust during the period covered by the report, and




	 







	 




	(iii)




	a report of any material
	transactions between the Trust and USCF or any of its affiliates, including fees or compensation paid by the Trust and the
	services performed by USCF or any such affiliate for such fees or compensation.





	 







	63










	 








	Quarterly
	Reports

	. Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of each fiscal year, USCF shall cause to be delivered, a quarterly report
	containing a balance sheet and statement of income for the period covered by the report, each of which may be unaudited but shall
	be certified by USCF as fairly presenting the financial position and results of operations of the Trust during the period covered
	by the report. The report shall also contain a description of any material event regarding the business of the partnership during
	the period covered by the report.





	Monthly
	Reports

	. Within 30 days after the end of each month, USCF shall cause to be delivered, a monthly report containing an account
	statement, which will include a statement of income (loss) and a statement of changes in NAV, for the prescribed period. In addition,
	the account statement will disclose any material business dealings between the Trust, USCF, commodity trading advisor, FCM, or
	the principals thereof that previously have not been disclosed in this prospectus or any amendment thereto, other account statements
	or annual reports.




	The Trust
	will provide information to its shareholders to the extent required by applicable SEC, CFTC and NYSE requirements. An issuer,

	U.S. Federal Income Tax
	Considerations





	 




	The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
	and disposition of shares of the Fund, and the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Fund, as of the date hereof. In general,
	this discussion is applicable to a shareholder who holds its shares as a capital asset. This summary does not purport to be a complete
	description of the income tax considerations applicable to an investment in shares. For example, we have not described tax consequences
	that may be relevant to certain types of shareholders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including
	dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies,
	persons holding shares as a part of a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging,” “conversion”
	or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or holders of shares whose “functional currency”
	is not the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, and regulations (“Treasury
	Regulations”), rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed, revoked
	or modified (possibly with retroactive effect) so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed
	below.

	As used herein, the term “U.S. Shareholder” means a shareholder that is, for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes, (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or partnership created or organized
	in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of
	which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (X) that is subject to the
	supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as described in section 7701(a)(30)
	of the Code or (Y) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States
	person. A “Non-U.S. Shareholder” is a holder that is not a U.S. Shareholder. If a partnership holds our shares, the
	tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are
	a partner of a partnership holding our shares, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences.




	USCF has
	received the opinion of Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP, counsel to the Trust, that, subject to the conditions, limitations and
	assumptions stated in this discussion, the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Fund and to U.S. shareholders
	and Non-U.S. shareholders (as defined below) will be as described in the following paragraphs. In rendering its opinion, Eversheds
	Sutherland (US) LLP has relied on the facts and assumptions described in this prospectus as well as certain factual representations
	made by the Trust and USCF. This opinion is not binding on the IRS. No ruling has been requested from the IRS with respect to
	any matter affecting the Fund or prospective investors, and the IRS may disagree with the tax positions taken by the Trust. If
	the IRS were to challenge the Trust’s tax positions in litigation, they might not be sustained by the courts.




	EACH PROSPECTIVE
	INVESTOR IS ADVISED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN SHARES,
	AS WELL AS ANY APPLICABLE STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES, IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.






	Tax Status of the Trust
	and the Fund






	 




	The Trust is organized and operated as a statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement
	and applicable Delaware law. Notwithstanding the Trust’s status as a statutory trust and the Fund’s status as a series
	of that trust, due to the nature of its activities, the Fund will be treated as a partnership rather than a trust for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. In addition, the trading of shares on NYSE will cause the Fund to be classified as a “publicly traded
	partnership” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Code, a publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as
	a corporation. In the case of an entity (such as the Fund) that is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, however,
	an exception to this general rule applies if at least 90% of the entity’s gross income is “qualifying income”
	for each taxable year of its existence. For this purpose, “qualifying income” is defined as including, in pertinent
	part, interest (other than from a financial business), dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of capital assets held
	for the production of interest or dividends. In addition, qualifying income includes any income that would satisfy the requirements
	of Code Section 851(b)(2), which includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities, net income derived from
	an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership, and other income (including, but not limited to, gains from option, futures
	or forward contraction) derived with respect to its business of investment in securities. Further, in the case of a partnership
	a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities (other than as inventory) or of futures, forwards and options
	with respect to commodities, “qualifying income” includes income and gains from commodities and futures, forwards,
	options and swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities. In connection with the opinion provided by
	Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP, the Trust and USCF have represented, among other things, the following to Eversheds Sutherland (US)
	LLP:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	At least 90% of the
	Fund’s gross income for each taxable year will be derived from (i) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory)
	or futures, forwards, options, swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (ii) interest
	income;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The Fund is organized
	and will be operated in accordance with its governing documents and applicable law; and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	The Fund has not elected,
	and the Fund will not elect, to be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.





	 







	65










	 







	Based in part
	on these representations, Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP is of the opinion that the Fund will be classified as a partnership that
	it is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Fund’s taxation as a partnership rather than
	a corporation will require USCF to conduct the Fund’s business activities in such a manner that it satisfies the qualifying
	income exception on a continuing basis. No assurance can be given that the Fund’s operations for any given year will produce
	income that satisfies the requirements of the qualifying income exception. Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP will not review the Fund’s
	ongoing compliance with these requirements and will have no obligation to advise the Trust, the Fund or the Fund’s shareholders
	in the event of any subsequent change in the facts, representations or applicable law relied upon in reaching its opinion.




	If the Fund failed to satisfy the qualifying income exception in any year, other than a failure that is determined
	by the IRS to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery (in which case the Fund could be required
	to pay over amounts determined by the IRS), the Fund would be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
	would pay U.S. federal income tax on its income at regular corporate rates. In that event, shareholders of the Fund would not report
	their share of the Fund’s income or loss on their returns. In addition, any distributions to shareholders would be treated
	as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to holding period
	and other requirements, any such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower maximum
	tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains. To the extent a distribution exceeded the Fund’s earnings and profits, it
	would be treated as a return of capital up to the amount of a shareholder’s basis in its shares and thereafter as gain from
	the sale of shares. Accordingly, if the Fund were to be taxable as a corporation, it would likely have a material adverse effect
	on the economic return from an investment in the Fund and on the value of the shares.




	The remainder
	of this summary assumes that the Fund is classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership that it is not taxable
	as a corporation.






	U.S. Shareholders







	 






	Tax Consequences of Ownership
	of Shares






	 






	Taxation of
	the Fund’s Income.

	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by the Fund on its income. Instead, the Fund files annual partnership
	returns, and each U.S. Shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the Fund’s
	income, gain, loss, deduction and credit reported on the Fund’s partnership return. These items must be reported without
	regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from the Fund during the taxable
	year. As a result, if, for example, the Fund recognizes ordinary income in the form of interest on Treasuries and other investments,
	and net capital gain from Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments for a taxable year, shareholders must report
	their share of these items regardless of whether the Fund makes any distributions to shareholders. Consequently, a shareholder
	may be taxed on income or gain recognized by the Fund but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the resulting tax liability
	or a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability. Because USCF currently does not intend to make distributions, it
	is likely that, a U.S. Shareholder that is allocated income or gain from the Fund will be required to pay taxes on its allocable
	share of such income or gain from sources other than the Fund distributions.





	Monthly
	Conventions for Allocations of the Fund’s Profit and Loss and Capital Account Restatement.

	Under Code section 704, the
	determination of a partner’s distributive share of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is governed by the
	applicable organizational document unless the allocation provided by such document lacks “substantial economic effect.”
	An allocation that lacks substantial economic effect nonetheless will be respected if it is in accordance with the partners’
	interests in the partnership, determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements
	among the partners. Subject to the discussion below, concerning certain conventions to be used by the Fund, allocations of the
	Fund income pursuant to the Trust Agreement should be considered as having substantial economic effect or as being in accordance
	with a shareholder’s interest in the Fund.




	In situations
	where a partner’s interest in a partnership is sold or otherwise transferred during a taxable year, the Code generally requires
	that partnership tax items for the year be allocated to the partner using either an interim closing of the books or a daily proration
	method. The Fund intends to allocate tax items using an interim closing of the books method under which income, gain, loss, deductions
	and credits will be determined on a monthly “mark-to-market” basis, taking into account the Fund’s accrued income
	and deductions and gains and losses (both realized and unrealized) for the month. The tax items for each month during the taxable
	year will then be allocated among the holders of shares in proportion to the number of shares owned by them as of the close of
	business on the last trading day of the previous month (the “monthly allocation convention”).




	 








	66










	 











	Under
	the monthly allocation convention, if an investor who held a share as of the close of business on the last trading day of the
	previous month disposes of a share during the current month, such investor will be treated for purposes of making allocations
	as if it owned the share throughout the current month. For example, an investor who buys a share on April 10 of a year and
	sells it on May 20 of the same year will be allocated all of the tax items attributable to May (because he is deemed to hold
	it through the last day of May) but will not be allocated any of the tax items attributable to April. The tax items attributable
	to that share for April will be allocated to the person who is the actual or deemed holder of the share as of the close of business
	on the last trading day of March. Under the monthly convention, an investor who purchases and sells a share during the same month,
	and therefore does not hold (and is not deemed to hold) the share at the close of business on the last trading day of either that
	month or the previous month, will receive no allocations with respect to that share for any period. Accordingly, investors may
	receive no allocations with respect to shares that they actually held, or may receive allocations with respect to shares attributable
	to periods that they did not actually hold the shares. Investors who hold a share on the last trading day of the first month of
	the Fund’s operation will be allocated the tax items for that month, as well as the tax items for the following month, attributable
	to the share.




	By investing
	in shares, a U.S. Shareholder agrees that, in the absence of new legislation, regulatory or administrative guidance, or judicial
	rulings to the contrary, it will file its U.S. income tax returns in a manner that is consistent with the monthly allocation convention
	as described above and with the IRS Schedule K-1 or any successor form provided to shareholders by the Trust.




	In addition,
	for any month in which a Creation Basket is issued or a Redemption Basket is redeemed, the Fund generally will credit or debit
	the “book” capital accounts of its existing shareholders with any unrealized gain or loss, on the Fund’s assets.
	For this purpose, unrealized gain or loss will be computed based on the lowest fair market value of the Fund’s assets during
	the month in which shares are issued or redeemed, which may be different than the value of the assets at the time of an issuance
	or redemption. The capital accounts as adjusted in this manner will be used in making tax allocations intended to account for
	the differences between the tax basis and fair market value of assets of the Fund at the time new shares are issued or outstanding
	shares are redeemed (so-called “reverse Code section 704(c) allocations”). The intended effect of these adjustments
	is to equitably allocate among shareholders any unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Fund’s assets existing at
	the time of a contribution or redemption for book and tax purposes.




	USCF believes that application of the conventions described above is consistent with the intent of the partnership
	provisions of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations and that the resulting allocations should have substantial economic
	effect or otherwise should be respected as being in accordance with shareholders’ interests in the Fund for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. The Code and existing Treasury Regulations do not expressly permit adoption of these conventions, although
	the monthly allocation convention described above is consistent with methods permitted under the applicable Treasury Regulations,
	as well as the legislative history for the provisions that requires allocations to appropriately reflect changes in ownership interests.
	It is possible that the IRS could successfully challenge the Fund’s allocation conventions on the ground that they do not
	satisfy the technical requirements of the Code or Treasury Regulations, requiring a shareholder to report a greater or lesser share
	of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit than if our conventions were respected. USCF is authorized to revise our allocation
	method to conform to the requirements of future Treasury Regulations.




	The conventions used by the Fund in making tax allocations may cause a shareholder to be allocated more or
	less income or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes than its proportionate share of the economic income or loss realized by
	the Fund during the period it held its shares. This mismatch between taxable and economic income or loss in some cases may be temporary,
	reversing itself in a later period when the shares are sold, but could be permanent.





	Section 754
	election.

	The Fund intends to make the election permitted by section 754 of the Code, which election is irrevocable
	without the consent of the IRS. The effect of this election is that when a secondary market sale of shares occurs, the Fund
	adjusts the purchaser’s proportionate share of the tax basis of its assets to fair market value, as reflected in the
	price paid for the shares, as if the purchaser had directly acquired an interest in the Fund’s assets. The section 754
	election is intended to eliminate disparities between a partner’s basis in its partnership interest and its share of
	the tax bases of the partnership’s assets, so that the partner’s allocable share of taxable gain or loss on a
	disposition of an asset will correspond to its share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset since it
	acquired its interest. Depending on the price paid for shares and the tax bases of the Fund’s assets at the time of the
	purchase, the effect of the section 754 election on a purchaser of shares may be favorable or unfavorable. In order to make
	the appropriate basis adjustments in a cost effective manner, the Fund will perform only one basis adjustment per month using
	the lowest closing price for Fund shares during that month regardless of the price a purchaser actually paid for the shares.
	As a result, the basis adjustments made with respect to a purchaser in accordance with the section 754 election may not
	conform to the price such purchaser paid for its shares, which may result in the purchaser being allocated additional gain or
	loss from the Fund compared to the gain or loss that would be allocated to such purchaser if the actual price of the acquired
	shares was used to perform the adjustment. It is possible the IRS will successfully assert that the conventions and
	assumptions applied are improper and require different basis adjustments to be made, which could adversely affect some
	shareholders.

	Section 1256
	Contracts.


	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Fund generally
	is required to us a “mark-to-market” method of accounting under which unrealized gains and losses instruments constituting
	“section 1256 contracts” are recognized currently. A section 1256 contract is defined as including, in relevant part:
	(1) a futures contract that is traded on or subject to the rules of a national securities exchange which is registered with
	the SEC, a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the CFTC, or any other board of trade or exchange designated
	by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount that may be withdrawn
	depends on a system of “marking to market”; (2) a forward contract on exchange-traded foreign currencies, where
	the contracts are traded in the interbank market; (3) a non-equity option traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board
	or exchange; (4) a dealer equity option; or (5) a dealer securities futures contract.. Section 1256 contracts held at the
	end of each taxable year are treated as if they were sold for their fair market value on the last business day of the taxable
	year (i.e., are “marked to market”). In addition, any gain or loss realized from a disposition, termination or marking-to-market
	of a section 1256 contract generally is treated as long-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 60% thereof, and as short-term
	capital gain or loss to the extent of 40% thereof, without regard to the actual holding period (“60 – 40 treatment”).





	Many of
	the Fund’s Oil Futures Contracts and some of its Other Oil-Related Investments will qualify as “section 1256 contracts”
	under the Code. Gain or loss recognized through disposition, termination or marking-to market of the Fund’s section 1256
	contracts will be subject to 60 – 40 treatment and allocated to shareholders in accordance with the monthly allocation convention.
	Cleared swaps and other commodity swaps will most likely not qualify as section 1256 contracts. If a commodity swap is not treated
	as a section 1256 contract, any gain or loss on the swap recognized at the time of disposition or termination will be long-term
	or short-term capital gain or loss depending on the holding period of the swap.





	Limitations
	on Deductibility of Losses and Certain Expenses.

	A number of different provisions of the Code may defer or disallow the deduction
	of losses or expenses allocated to shareholders by the Fund, including but not limited to those described below.




	A shareholder’s
	deduction of its allocable share of any loss of the Fund is limited to the lesser of (1) the tax basis in its shares or (2) in
	the case of a shareholder that is an individual or a closely held corporation, the amount which the shareholder is considered
	to have “at risk” with respect to the Fund’s activities. In general, the amount at risk will be a shareholder’s
	invested capital. Losses in excess of the lesser of tax basis or the amount at risk must be deferred until years in which the
	Fund generates additional taxable income against which to offset such carryover losses or until additional capital is placed at
	risk.




	Non-corporate
	taxpayers are permitted to deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains for the taxable year plus $3,000 of
	other income. Unused capital losses can be carried forward and used to offset capital gains in future years. In addition, a non-corporate
	taxpayer may elect to carry back net losses on section 1256 contracts to each of the three preceding years and use them to
	offset section 1256 contract gains in those years, subject to certain limitations. Corporate taxpayers generally may deduct capital
	losses only to the extent of capital gains, subject to special carryback and carryforward rules.




	Otherwise
	deductible expenses incurred by non-corporate taxpayers constituting “miscellaneous itemized deductions,” generally
	including investment-related expenses (other than interest and certain other specified expenses), are deductible only to the extent
	they exceed 2% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the year. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we believe
	the management fees that the Fund pays to USCF and other expenses of the Fund constitute investment-related expenses subject to
	the miscellaneous itemized deduction limitation, rather than expenses incurred in connection with a trade or business, and will
	report these expenses consistent with that interpretation. The Code imposes additional limitations on the amount of certain itemized
	deductions allowable to individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of certain amounts by reducing the otherwise allowable
	portion of such deductions by an amount equal to the lesser of:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	3% of the individual’s
	adjusted gross income in excess of certain threshold amounts; or






	 






	 




	•




	 




	80% of the amount
	of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year.





	 


	 


	 


	 





	Non-corporate
	shareholders generally may deduct “investment interest expense” only to the extent of their “net investment
	income.” Investment interest expense of a shareholder will generally include any interest accrued by the Fund and any interest
	paid or accrued on direct borrowings by a shareholder to purchase or carry its shares, such as interest with respect to a margin
	account. Net investment income generally includes gross income from property held for investment (including “portfolio income”
	under the passive loss rules but not, absent an election, long-term capital gains or certain qualifying dividend income) less
	deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income.




	 








	68










	 









	To the
	extent that the Fund allocates losses or expenses to you that must be deferred or disallowed as a result of these or other limitations
	in the Code, you may be taxed on income in excess of your economic income or distributions (if any) on your shares. As one example,
	you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income accrued by the Fund for a particular taxable year,
	and in the same year allocated a share of a capital loss that you cannot deduct currently because of the limitations discussed
	above. As another example, you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income and capital gain for
	a year, but be unable to deduct some or all of your share of management fees and/or margin account interest incurred by you with
	respect to your shares. Shareholders are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors regarding the effect of limitations
	under the Code on their ability to deduct their allocable share of the Fund’s losses and expenses.






	Tax Basis of Shares






	 




	A shareholder’s
	tax basis in its shares is important in determining (1) the amount of taxable gain it will realize on the sale or other disposition
	of its shares, (2) the amount of non-taxable distributions that it may receive from the Fund, and (3) its ability to
	utilize its distributive share of any losses of the Fund on its tax return. A shareholder’s initial tax basis of its shares
	will equal its cost for the shares plus its share of the Fund’s liabilities (if any) at the time of purchase. In general,
	a shareholder’s “share” of those liabilities will equal the sum of (i) the entire amount of any otherwise
	nonrecourse liability of the Fund as to which the shareholder or an affiliate is the creditor (a “partner nonrecourse liability”)
	and (ii) a pro rata share of any nonrecourse liabilities of the Fund that are not partner nonrecourse liabilities as to any
	shareholder.




	A shareholder’s
	tax basis in its shares generally will be (1) increased by (a) its allocable share of the Fund’s taxable income
	and gain and (b) any additional contributions by the shareholder to the Fund and (2) decreased (but not below zero)
	by (a) its allocable share of the Fund’s tax deductions and losses and (b) any distributions by the Fund to the
	shareholder. For this purpose, an increase in a shareholder’s share of the Fund’s liabilities will be treated as a
	contribution of cash by the shareholder to the Fund and a decrease in that share will be treated as a distribution of cash by
	the Fund to the shareholder. Pursuant to certain IRS rulings, a shareholder will be required to maintain a single, “unified”
	basis in all shares that it owns. As a result, when a shareholder that acquired its shares at different prices sells less than
	all of its shares, such shareholder will not be entitled to specify particular shares (

	e.g.

	, those with a higher basis)
	as having been sold. Rather, it must determine its gain or loss on the sale by using an “equitable apportionment”
	method to allocate a portion of its unified basis in its shares to the shares sold.





	Treatment
	of the Fund Distributions.

	If the Fund makes non-liquidating distributions to shareholders, such distributions generally will not be
	taxable to the shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes except to the extent that the sum of (i) the amount of cash
	and (ii) the fair market value (subject to certain exceptions and adjustments) of marketable securities distributed exceeds
	the shareholder’s adjusted basis of its interest in the Fund immediately before the distribution. Any cash distributions
	in excess of a shareholder’s tax basis generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of shares.





	Constructive
	Termination of the Partnership.

	The Fund will be considered to have been terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale
	or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in its shares within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing
	of the Fund’s taxable year for all shareholders. In the case of a shareholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal
	year ending December 31, the closing of the Fund’s taxable year may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income
	or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination. We would be required to make new tax elections after
	a termination. A termination could result in tax penalties for the shareholders if we were unable to determine that the termination
	had occurred. Moreover, a termination might either accelerate the application of, or subject us to, any tax legislation enacted
	before the termination.







	Tax Consequences of Disposition
	of Shares





	 




	If a shareholder
	sells its shares, it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted tax basis
	for the shares sold. A shareholder’s amount realized will be the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property
	received plus its share of any the Fund debt outstanding.




	Gain or
	loss recognized by a shareholder on the sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year will generally be taxable as long-term
	capital gain or loss; otherwise, such gain or loss will generally be taxable as short-term capital gain or loss. A special election
	is available under the Treasury Regulations that will allow shareholders to identify and use the actual holding periods for the
	shares sold for purposes of determining whether the gain or loss recognized on a sale of shares will give rise to long-term or
	short-term capital gain or loss. It is expected that most shareholders will be eligible to elect, and generally will elect, to
	identify and use the actual holding period for shares sold. If a shareholder fails to make the election or is not able to identify
	the holding periods of the shares sold, the shareholder may have a split holding period in the shares sold. Under such circumstances,
	a shareholder will be required to determine its holding period in the shares sold by first determining the portion of its entire
	interest in the Fund that would give rise to long-term capital gain or loss if its entire interest were sold and the portion that
	would give rise to short-term capital gain or loss if the entire interest were sold. The shareholder would then treat each share
	sold as giving rise to long-term capital gain or loss and short-term capital gain or loss in the same proportions as if it had
	sold its entire interest in the Fund.




	 








	69










	 









	Under
	Section 751 of the Code, a portion of a shareholder’s gain or loss from the sale of shares (regardless of the holding
	period for such shares), will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to “unrealized
	receivables” or “inventory” owned by the Fund. The term “unrealized receivables” includes, among
	other things, market discount bonds and short-term debt instruments to the extent such items would give rise to ordinary income
	if sold by the Fund. However, the short term capital gain on section 1256 contracts resulting from 60 – 40 treatment, described
	above, should not be subject to this rule.




	If some
	or all of a shareholder’s shares are lent by its broker or other agent to a third party — for example, for use by
	the third party in covering a short sale — the shareholder may be considered as having made a taxable disposition of the
	loaned shares, in which case —




	 






	 




	•




	 




	the shareholder may
	recognize taxable gain or loss to the same extent as if it had sold the shares for cash;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	any of the Fund’s income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to those shares during the period of the
	loan will not be reportable by the shareholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	any distributions
	the shareholder receives with respect to the shares under the loan agreements will be fully taxable to the shareholder, most
	likely as ordinary income.





	 


	 


	 


	 





	Shareholders
	desiring to avoid these and other possible consequences of a deemed disposition of their shares should consider modifying any
	applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit the lending of their shares.







	Other Tax Matters






	 






	Information
	Reporting.

	The Trust will report tax information to the beneficial owners of shares and the IRS. Shareholders of the
	Fund are treated as beneficial owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Fund will furnish its shareholders
	each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), which will be used by the shareholders in completing their tax
	returns. The IRS has ruled that assignees of partnership interests who have not been admitted to a partnership as partners but
	who have the capacity to exercise substantial dominion and control over the assigned partnership interests will be considered beneficial
	owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On the basis of such ruling, except as otherwise provided herein, we will treat as
	a shareholder any person whose shares are held on their behalf by a broker or other nominee if that person has the right to direct
	the nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the ownership of the shares.




	Persons
	who hold an interest in the Fund as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us the following information: (1) the
	name, address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee; (2) whether the beneficial owner
	is (a) a person that is not a U.S. person, (b) a foreign government, an international organization or any wholly-owned
	agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing, or (c) a tax-exempt entity; (3) the number and a description of
	shares acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner; and (4) certain information including the dates of acquisitions
	and transfers, means of acquisitions and transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as well as the amount of net proceeds
	from sales. Brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information, including whether they are U.S.
	persons and certain information on shares they acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of $260 per failure,
	up to a maximum of $3,193,000 per calendar year, is imposed by the Code for failure to report such information correctly to the
	Fund. If the failure to furnish such information correctly is determined to be willful, the per failure penalty increases to $530
	or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported, and the $3,193,000 maximum does not apply. The nominee
	is required to supply the beneficial owner of the shares with the information furnished to the Fund.

	Partnership
	Audit Procedures.

	The IRS may audit the U.S. federal income tax returns filed by the Fund. Under current law, adjustments resulting
	from any such audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior year’s tax liability and could result in an audit of the
	shareholder’s own return. Any audit of a shareholder’s return could result in adjustments of non-partnership items
	as well as the Fund items. Partnerships are generally treated as separate entities for purposes of federal tax audits, judicial
	review of administrative adjustments by the IRS, and tax settlement proceedings. The tax treatment of partnership items of income,
	gain, loss, deduction and credit are determined at the partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding rather than in separate
	proceedings with the shareholders. The Code provides for one shareholder to be designated as the “tax matters partner”
	and represent the partnership purposes of these proceedings. The Trust Agreement appoints USCF as the tax matters partner of the
	Fund.




	In addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Fund may be liable for U.S. federal income
	tax on any “imputed understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of
	the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any shareholder and decreases
	in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any shareholder without any offset for any corresponding reductions in
	allocations of items of income or gain to any shareholder or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to
	any shareholder. If the Fund is required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax
	liability would reduce the net assets of the Fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares. Under certain
	circumstances, the Fund may be eligible to make an election

	(a
	“Push-Out Election”) to cause the shareholders to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including
	any interest and penalties. The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Fund to make this election is uncertain. If
	the election is made, the Fund would be required to provide shareholders who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year
	to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment (“Adjusted
	K-1s”). The shareholders would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted
	K-1s are issued. The Code provides for one person to be designated as the “partnership representative” to represent
	a partnership in all matters related to the audit of any partnership year. The partnership representative is authorized to bind
	the partnership and all of its partners, including exclusive authority to settle any tax audit, contest any tax matter in a court
	proceeding, to extend the statute of limitations with respect to any tax matter, and to make certain elections, including the Push-Out
	Election. The Trust Agreement will appoint USCF as the partnership representative of the Fund.






	Tax
	Shelter Disclosure Rules.

	In certain circumstances the Code and Treasury Regulations require that the IRS be notified of certain “reportable
	transactions” through a disclosure statement attached to a taxpayer’s U.S. federal income tax return. These disclosure
	rules may apply to transactions irrespective of whether they are structured to achieve particular tax benefits. They could require
	disclosure by the Trust or shareholders if a shareholder incurs a loss in excess of a specified threshold from a sale or redemption
	of its shares, or possibly in other circumstances. While these rules generally do not require disclosure of a loss recognized on
	the disposition of an asset in which the taxpayer has a “qualifying basis” (generally a basis equal to the amount of
	cash paid by the taxpayer for such asset), they apply to a loss recognized with respect to interests in a pass-through entity,
	such as the shares, even if the taxpayer’s basis in such interests is equal to the amount of cash it paid. In addition, significant
	penalties may be imposed in connection with a failure to comply with these reporting requirements.

	Investors should consult
	their own tax advisors concerning the application of these reporting requirements to their specific situation.






	Additional
	Tax on Investment Income.

	Individuals with income in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing
	jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on their “net investment income,” which
	generally includes income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than certain
	amounts earned from trades or businesses). The income subject to the additional 3.8% tax also includes income from businesses
	involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities.





	Tax-Exempt
	Organizations.

	Subject to numerous exceptions, qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, charitable
	organizations and certain other organizations that otherwise are exempt from U.S. federal income tax (collectively “exempt
	organizations”) nonetheless are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). Generally,
	UBTI means the gross income derived by an exempt organization from a trade or business that it regularly carries on, the conduct
	of which is not substantially related to the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose or function, less allowable deductions
	directly connected with that trade or business. If the Fund were to regularly carry on (directly or indirectly) a trade or business
	that is unrelated with respect to an exempt organization shareholder of the Fund, then in computing its UBTI, the shareholder must
	include its share of (1) the Fund’s gross income from the unrelated trade or business, whether or not distributed, and
	(2) the Fund’s allowable deductions directly connected with that gross income.




	UBTI generally
	does not include dividends, interest, or payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale of property (other
	than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business). Nonetheless, income on, and gain from
	the disposition of, “debt-financed property” is UBTI. Debt-financed property generally is income-producing property
	(including securities), the use of which is not substantially related to the exempt organization’s tax-exempt purposes,
	and with respect to which there is “acquisition indebtedness” at any time during the taxable year (or, if the property
	was disposed of during the taxable year, the 12-month period ending with the disposition). Acquisition indebtedness includes debt
	incurred to acquire property, debt incurred before the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for
	the acquisition, and debt incurred subsequent to the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for
	the acquisition and at the time of acquisition the incurrence of debt was foreseeable. The portion of the income from debt-financed
	property attributable to acquisition indebtedness is equal to the ratio of the average outstanding principal amount of acquisition
	indebtedness over the average adjusted basis of the property for the year. The Fund anticipates that it will employ leverage as
	part of its investment strategy. As a result, the Fund anticipates that a portion of its income will constitute UBTI. In addition,
	an exempt organization shareholder that incurs acquisition indebtedness to purchase its shares in the Fund may have UBTI.




	 








	71










	 








	The federal tax rate applicable to an exempt organization shareholder on its UBTI generally will be either
	the corporate or trust tax rate, depending upon the shareholder’s form of organization. The Fund may report to each such
	shareholder information as to the portion, if any, of the shareholder’s income and gains from the Fund for any year that
	will be treated as UBTI; the calculation of that amount is complex, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s calculation
	of UBTI will be accepted by the IRS. An exempt organization shareholder will be required to make payments of estimated U.S. federal
	income tax with respect to its UBTI.




	Regulated
	Investment Companies.

	Interests in and income from “qualified publicly traded partnerships” satisfying certain
	gross income tests are treated as qualifying assets and income, respectively, for purposes of determining eligibility for regulated
	investment company (“RIC”) status. A RIC may invest up to 25% of its assets in interests in a qualified publicly traded
	partnership. The determination of whether a publicly traded partnership such as the Fund is a qualified publicly traded partnership
	is made on an annual basis. While the issue is not certain, the Fund does not expect to be treated a qualified publicly traded
	partnership.






	Non-U.S. Shareholders






	 




	Generally, non-U.S.
	persons who derive U.S. source income or gain from investing or engaging in a U.S. business are taxable on two categories of income.
	The first category consists of amounts that are fixed, determinable, annual and periodic income, such as interest, dividends and
	rent that are not connected with the operation of a U.S. trade or business (“FDAP”). The second category is income
	that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (“ECI”). FDAP income (other than interest
	that is considered “portfolio interest”) is generally subject to a 30% withholding tax, which may be reduced for certain
	categories of income by a treaty between the U.S. and the recipient’s country of residence. In contrast, ECI is generally
	subject to U.S. tax on a net basis at graduated rates upon the filing of a U.S. tax return. Where a non-U.S. person has ECI as
	a result of an investment in a partnership, the ECI is subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 39.6% for individual shareholders
	and a rate of 35% for corporate shareholders.





	Withholding
	on Allocations and Distributions.

	The Code provides that a non-U.S. person who is a partner in a partnership that is engaged
	in a U.S. trade or business during a taxable year will also be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business during that
	year. Classifying an activity by a partnership as an investment or an operating business is a factual determination. Under certain
	safe harbors in the Code, an investment fund whose activities consist of trading in stocks, securities, or commodities for its
	own account generally will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business unless it is a dealer is such stocks, securities,
	or commodities. This safe harbor applies to investments in commodities only if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt
	in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place. Although the
	matter is not free from doubt, the Fund believes that the activities directly conducted by the Fund will not result in the Fund
	being engaged in a trade or business within in the United States. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully
	assert that the Fund’s activities constitute a U.S. trade or business.




	In the
	event that the Fund’s activities were considered to constitute a U.S. trade or business, the Fund would be required to withhold
	at the highest rate specified in Code section 1 (currently 39.6%) on allocations of our income to individual Non-U.S. Shareholders
	and the highest rate specified in Code Section 11(b) (currently 35%) on allocations of our income to corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders,
	when such income is allocated or distributed. A Non-U.S. Shareholder with ECI will generally be required to file a U.S. federal
	income tax return, and the return will provide the Non-U.S. Shareholder with the mechanism to seek a refund of any withholding
	in excess of such shareholder’s actual U.S. federal income tax liability. Any amount withheld by the Fund will be treated
	as a distribution to the Non-U.S. Shareholder.




	If the
	Fund is not treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a Non-U.S. Shareholder may nevertheless be treated as having FDAP
	income, which would be subject to a 30% withholding tax (possibly subject to reduction by treaty), with respect to some or all
	of its distributions from the Fund or its allocable share of the Fund’s income. Amounts withheld on behalf of a Non-U.S.
	Shareholder will be treated as being distributed to such shareholder.




	To the
	extent any interest income allocated to a Non-U.S. Shareholder that otherwise constitutes FDAP is considered “portfolio
	interest,” neither the allocation of such interest income to the non-U.S. shareholder nor a subsequent distribution of such
	interest income to the Non-U.S. Shareholder will be subject to withholding, provided that the Non-U.S. Shareholder is not otherwise
	engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and provides the Fund with a timely and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN,
	W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form. In general, “portfolio interest” is interest paid on debt obligations issued in
	registered form, unless the “recipient” owns 10% or more of the voting power of the issuer.




	 








	72










	 







	The Trust expects
	that most of the Fund’s interest income will qualify as “portfolio interest.” In order for the Fund to avoid
	withholding on any interest income allocable to Non-U.S. Shareholders that would qualify as “portfolio interest,”
	it will be necessary for all Non-U.S. Shareholders to provide the Fund with a timely and properly completed and executed Form
	W-8BEN W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form.





	Gain
	from Sale of Shares.

	Gain from the sale or exchange of shares may be taxable to a Non-U.S. Shareholder if the Non-U.S. Shareholder
	is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year. In such case, the nonresident
	alien individual will be subject to a 30% withholding tax on the amount of such individual’s gain.





	Branch
	Profits Tax on Corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders.

	In addition to the taxes noted above, any Non-U.S. Shareholders that are corporations
	may also be subject to an additional tax, the branch profits tax, at a rate of 30%. The branch profits tax is imposed on a non-U.S.
	corporation’s dividend equivalent amount, which generally consists of the corporation’s after-tax earnings and profits
	that are effectively connected with the corporation’s U.S. trade or business but are not reinvested in a U.S. business.
	This tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the Non-U.S.
	Shareholder is a “qualified resident.”





	Prospective
	Non-U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisor with regard to these and other tax issues unique to Non-U.S. Shareholders.







	Backup Withholding






	 




	The Fund may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax (“backup withholding”) at a rate
	of 28% from all payments to: (1) any shareholder who fails to furnish the Fund with his, her or its correct taxpayer identification
	number or a certificate that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding, and (2) any shareholder with respect to whom
	the IRS notifies the Fund that the shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and
	to respond to notices to that effect. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be returned or credited against a taxpayer’s
	regular U.S. federal income tax liability if appropriate information is provided to the IRS.






	Foreign Account Tax
	Compliance Act Provisions






	 




	Legislation commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” or “FATCA,”
	generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”)
	unless such FFIs (i) enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts
	held by United States persons (or held by foreign entities that have United States persons as substantial owners), certain information,
	or (ii) reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) with the United States
	to collect and share such information and comply with the terms of such IGA and any enabling legislation or regulations. The types
	of income subject to the tax include U.S.-source interest and dividends and, after December 31, 2018, the gross proceeds from the
	sale of any property that could produce U.S.-source interest or dividends. The information to be reported includes the identity
	and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder’s
	account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, this legislation also imposes a 30% withholding on payments to foreign entities
	that are not FFIs unless the foreign entities certify that they do not have a greater than 10% U.S. owner or provide the withholding
	agent with identifying information on each greater than 10% U.S. owner. Depending on the status of a Non-U.S. Shareholder and the
	status of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares, Non-U.S. Shareholders could be subject to this 30% withholding
	tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S.
	Shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.




	 






	Other Tax Considerations






	 



	In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local
	income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes, and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be
	imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the Fund does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside. Although
	an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on
	its investment in the Fund. It is each shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local, and
	foreign tax returns. Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP has not provided an opinion concerning any aspects of state, local or foreign
	tax or U.S. federal tax other than those U.S. federal income tax issues discussed herein.

	Investment by ERISA Accounts







	 








	General






	 




	Most employee
	benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
	of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or the Code, or both. This section discusses certain considerations that arise under
	ERISA and the Code that a fiduciary of: (i) an employee benefit plan as defined in ERISA; (ii) a plan as defined in Section 4975
	of the Code; or (iii) any collective investment vehicle, business trust, investment partnership, pooled separate account
	or other entity the assets of which are treated as comprised (at least in part) of “plan assets” under the ERISA “plan
	assets” rules (“plan asset entity”) who has investment discretion should take into account before deciding to
	invest the plan’s assets in the Fund. Employee benefit plans under ERISA, plans under the Code and plan asset entities are
	collectively referred to below as “plans,” and fiduciaries with investment discretion are referred to below as “plan
	fiduciaries.”




	This summary
	is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code as of the date hereof. This summary is not intended to be complete, but only
	to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code likely to be raised by your advisors. The summary does not include state
	or local law.





	Potential
	plan investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the appropriateness of an investment in the
	Fund and the manner in which shares should be purchased.







	Special Investment Considerations






	 




	Each plan fiduciary
	must consider the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in the Fund, including the role that an investment
	in the Fund would play in the plan’s overall investment portfolio. Each plan fiduciary, before deciding to invest in the
	Fund, must be satisfied that the investment is prudent for the plan, that the investments of the plan are diversified so as to
	minimize the risk of large losses, and that an investment in the Fund complies with the terms of the plan.






	The Fund and Plan Assets






	 




	A regulation
	issued under ERISA contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an equity interest of a statutory trust will
	result in the underlying assets of the statutory trust being deemed plan assets for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of
	the Code. Those rules provide that assets of a statutory trust will not be plan assets of a plan that purchases an equity interest
	in the statutory trust if the equity interest purchased is a publicly-offered security. If the underlying assets of a statutory
	trust are considered to be assets of any plan for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the operations of that trust
	would be subject to and, in some cases, limited by the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.




	The publicly-offered
	security exception described above applies if the equity interest is a security that is:




	 






	 




	(1)




	freely transferable
	(determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances);






	 






	 




	(2)




	part of a class of
	securities that is widely held (meaning that the class of securities is owned by 100 or more investors independent of the
	issuer and of each other); and






	 






	 




	(3)




	either (a) part
	of a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act or (b) sold to the plan as
	part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and the class of which such security
	is a part is registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days (or such later time as may be allowed by the SEC) after the
	end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred.





	 


	 


	 





	The plan
	asset regulations under ERISA state that the determination of whether a security is freely transferable is to be made based on
	all the relevant facts and circumstances. In the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment
	is $10,000 or less, the following requirements, alone or in combination, ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security
	is freely transferable: (1) a requirement that no transfer or assignment of the security or rights relating to the security
	be made that would violate any federal or state law; and (2) a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without
	advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security.




	 








	74










	 









	USCF believes
	that the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to the shares of the Fund. USCF believes that the shares of the
	Fund therefore constitute publicly-offered securities, and the underlying assets of the Fund should not be considered to constitute
	plan assets of any plan that purchases shares.






	Prohibited Transactions






	 




	ERISA and the
	Code generally prohibit certain transactions involving a plan and persons who have certain specified relationships to the plan.
	In general, shares may not be purchased with the assets of a plan if USCF, the clearing brokers, the trading advisors (if any),
	or any of their affiliates, agents or employees either:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	exercise any discretionary
	authority or discretionary control with respect to management of the plan;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	exercise any authority
	or control with respect to management or disposition of the assets of the plan;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	render investment
	advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any monies or other property of the plan;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	have any authority
	or responsibility to render investment advice with respect to any monies or other property of the plan; or






	 






	 




	•




	 




	have any discretionary
	authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan.





	 


	 


	 


	 





	Also,
	a prohibited transaction may occur under ERISA or the Code when circumstances indicate that (1) the investment in shares
	is made or retained for the purpose of avoiding application of the fiduciary standards of ERISA, (2) the investment in shares
	constitutes an arrangement under which the Fund is expected to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited if entered
	into directly by the plan purchasing the shares, (3) the investing plan, by itself, has the authority or influence to cause
	the Fund to engage in such transactions, or (4) a person who is prohibited from transacting with the investing plan may,
	but only with the aid of certain of its affiliates and the investing plan, cause the Fund to engage in such transactions with
	such person.






	Special IRA Rules






	 




	IRAs are not
	subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards, but are subject to their own rules, including the prohibited transaction rules of
	Section 4975 of the Code, which generally mirror ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules. For example, IRAs are subject
	to special custody rules and must maintain a qualifying IRA custodial arrangement separate and distinct from the Fund and its
	custodial arrangement. If a separate qualifying custodial arrangement is not maintained, an investment in the shares will be treated
	as a distribution from the IRA. Second, IRAs are prohibited from investing in certain commingled investments, and USCF makes no
	representation regarding whether an investment in shares is an inappropriate commingled investment for an IRA. Third, in applying
	the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, in addition to the rules summarized above, the individual
	for whose benefit the IRA is maintained is also treated as the creator of the IRA. For example, if the owner or beneficiary of
	an IRA enters into any transaction, arrangement, or agreement involving the assets of his or her IRA to benefit the IRA owner
	or beneficiary (or his or her relatives or business affiliates) personally, or with the understanding that such benefit will occur,
	directly or indirectly, such transaction could give rise to a prohibited transaction that is not exempted by any available exemption.
	Moreover, in the case of an IRA, the consequences of a non-exempt prohibited transaction are that the IRA’s assets will
	be treated as if they were distributed, causing immediate taxation of the assets (including any early distribution penalty tax
	applicable under Section 72 of the Code), in addition to any other fines or penalties that may apply.






	Exempt Plans






	 




	Certain employee
	benefit plans may be governmental plans or church plans. Governmental plans and church plans are generally not subject to ERISA,
	nor do the prohibited transaction provisions described above apply to them. These plans are, however, subject to prohibitions
	against certain related-party transactions under Section 503 of the Code, which are similar to the prohibited transaction
	rules described above. In addition, the fiduciary of any governmental or church plan must consider any applicable state or local
	laws and any restrictions and duties of common law imposed upon the plan.




	 








	75










	 









	No view
	is expressed as to whether an investment in the Fund (and any continued investment in the Fund), or the operation and administration
	of the Fund, is appropriate or permissible for any governmental plan or church plan under Code Section 503, or under any
	state, county, local or other law relating to that type of plan.





	Allowing
	an investment in the Fund is not to be construed as a representation by the Trust, the Fund, USCF, any trading advisor, any clearing
	broker, the Marketing Agent or legal counsel or other advisors to such parties or any other party that this investment meets some
	or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate
	for any such particular plan. The person with investment discretion should consult with the plan’s attorney and financial
	advisors as to the propriety of an investment in the Fund in light of the circumstances of the particular plan, current tax law
	and ERISA.








	Form of Shares







	 








	Registered Form






	 




	Shares are issued
	in registered form in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for
	the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all Shareholders and holders of the
	shares in certificated form in the registry (“Register”). USCF recognizes transfer of shares in certified form only
	if done in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants
	and/or accountholders in DTC.






	Book Entry






	 




	Individual certificates
	are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the
	Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence
	all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers
	and trust companies (“DTC Participants”), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial
	relationship with a DTC Participant (“Indirect Participants”), and (3) those who hold interests in the shares
	through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants
	acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants’ accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice
	applicable to securities eligible for DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants’
	securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.




	 






	DTC






	 




	DTC has advised
	us as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the
	Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a
	“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities
	for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic
	book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.





	 








	Transfer of Shares





	 




	The shares are
	only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their shares through
	DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through
	which their shares are held) to transfer the shares. Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.




	Transfers
	of interests in shares with DTC are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of DTC and the nature of
	the transfer. DTC has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and/or accountholders of DTC. Because
	DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person or
	entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC,
	or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document
	representing such interest.




	DTC has
	advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a shareholder (including, without limitation, the presentation
	of a global certificate for exchange) only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants in whose account with DTC interests
	in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate
	as to which such DTC Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.




	 








	76










	 












	Inter-Series Limitation
	on Liability





	 




	Because the Trust
	was established as a Delaware statutory trust, each series established under the Trust will be operated so that it will be liable
	only for obligations attributable to such series and will not be liable for obligations of any other series or affected by losses
	of any other series. If any creditor or shareholder of any particular series asserts against the series a valid claim with respect
	to its indebtedness or shares, the creditor or shareholder will only be able to obtain recovery from the assets of that series
	and not from the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. The assets of each series will include only those funds and
	other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the series on account of and for the benefit of that series, including,
	without limitation, amounts delivered to the Trust for the purchase of shares in a series. This limitation on liability is referred
	to as the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability. The Inter-Series Limitation on Liability is expressly provided for under the Delaware
	Statutory Trust Act, which provides that if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 3804(a)) are met, then the debts
	of any particular series will be enforceable only against the assets of such series and not against the assets of any other series
	or the Trust generally. In furtherance of the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability, every party providing services to the Trust,
	the Fund or USCF on behalf of the Trust or the Fund, will acknowledge and consent in writing to the Inter-Series Limitation on
	Liability with respect to such party’s claims.




	The existence
	of a Trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over the Fund. To the greatest
	extent permissible under Delaware law, the Trustee acts in an entirely passive role, delegating all authority for the management
	and operation of the Fund and the Trust to USCF. The Trustee does not provide custodial services with respect to the assets of
	the Fund.




	 







	Recognition of the Trust in Certain
	States





	 




	A number of states
	do not have “statutory trust” statutes such as that under which the Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware.
	It is possible, although unlikely, that a court in such state could hold that, due to the absence of any statutory provision to
	the contrary in such jurisdiction, the shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability
	as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, are not so entitled in
	such state. To protect shareholders against any loss of limited liability, the Trust Agreement provides that each written obligation
	undertaken by USCF on behalf of the Trust or the Fund shall give notice that the obligation is not binding upon the shareholders
	individually but is binding only upon the assets and property of the Fund, and no resort shall be had to the shareholders’
	personal property for satisfaction of such obligation. Furthermore, the Trust and the Fund indemnify all shareholders of the Fund
	against any liability that such shareholders might incur solely based on their status as shareholders of one or more shares (other
	than for taxes for which such shareholder is liable under the Trust Agreement).










	What is the Plan of Distribution?






	 







	Buying and Selling Shares






	 




	Most investors
	will buy and sell shares of the Fund in secondary market transactions through brokers. Shares will trade on NYSE under the ticker
	symbol “USOU.” Shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities. When buying
	or selling shares through a broker, most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Investors are encouraged
	to review the terms of their brokerage account for details on applicable charges.






	Marketing Agent and
	Authorized Participants






	 




	The offering
	of the Fund’s shares will be a best efforts offering. The Fund intends to continuously offer Creation Baskets consisting
	of 50,000 shares through the Marketing Agent, to Authorized Participants. Authorized Participants will pay a transaction fee equal
	to 0.04% of total NAV of the Creation Baskets for each order they place to create or redeem one or more Creation Baskets. USCF
	will pay the Marketing Agent a service fee in consideration of its provision of marketing services

	.

	Authorized Participants will not receive from the Fund, USCF or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in
	connection with the sale of shares. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of
	USCF for marketing and/or distribution-related services in connection with this offering exceed ten percent (10%) of the
	gross proceeds of this offering.




	The offering
	of baskets will be made in compliance with Conduct Rule 2310 of FINRA. Accordingly, Authorized Participants will not make any
	sales to any account over which they have discretionary authority without the prior written approval of a purchaser of shares.




	 








	77










	 









	The per
	share price of shares offered in Creation Baskets on any subsequent day will be the total NAV of the Fund calculated shortly after
	the close of NYSE on that day divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Fund. An Authorized Participant is
	not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares.




	By executing
	an Authorized Participant Agreement, an Authorized Participant will become part of the group of parties eligible to purchase baskets
	from, and put baskets for redemption to, the Fund. An Authorized Participant will not be under any obligation to create or redeem
	baskets or to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.




	The initial
	Authorized Participant of the Fund will be: RBC Capital Markets, LLC. 




	 




	Because new shares
	can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Fund, a “distribution,” as such
	term is used in the 1933 Act, will be occurring. Authorized Participants, other broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned
	that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that would render them
	statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. For example, the
	initial Authorized Participant will be a statutory underwriter with respect to the initial purchase of Creation Baskets. In addition,
	any purchaser who purchases shares with a view towards distribution of such shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter.
	In addition, an Authorized Participant, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases
	a basket from the Fund, breaks the basket down into the constituent shares and sells the shares to its customers; or if it chooses
	to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
	for the shares. In contrast, Authorized Participants may engage in secondary market or other transactions in shares that would
	not be deemed “underwriting.” For example, an Authorized Participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer
	with respect to shares that were previously distributed by other Authorized Participants. A determination of whether a particular
	market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
	broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description
	of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability
	provisions of the 1933 Act.




	Dealers
	who are neither Authorized Participants nor “underwriters” but are nonetheless participating in a distribution (as
	contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment”
	within the meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus-delivery exemption
	provided by Section 4(3) of the 1933 Act.




	USCF intends
	any broker-dealers selling shares will be members of FINRA. Investors intending to create or redeem baskets through Authorized
	Participants in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such investor’s state of domicile or residence
	should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable broker- dealer regulatory requirements under the state securities laws
	prior to such creation or redemption.




	While
	the Authorized Participants may be indemnified by USCF, they will not be entitled to receive a discount or commission from the
	Trust or USCF for their purchases of Creation Baskets.







	Calculating Per Share NAV





	 




	The Fund’s
	per share NAV will be calculated by:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	Taking the current
	market value of its total assets;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Subtracting any liabilities;
	and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	Dividing that total
	by the total number of outstanding shares.





	 


	 


	 


	 





	The Administrator will calculate the NAV of each Fund once each NYSE trading day. The NAV for a normal trading
	day will be released after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (“E.T.”). Trading during the Exchange’s Core Trading Session
	typically closes at 4:00 p.m. E.T. For futures contracts and options traded on exchanges the Administrator will use the closing
	or settlement price published by the applicable exchange or, in the case of a market disruption, the last traded price before settlement.
	In the case of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX
	or 2:30 p.m. E.T.) for the contracts traded on the NYMEX will be used. Other investments’ values for purposes of determining
	the NAV for each Fund, including Treasuries, cash equivalents (other than money market funds), cleared and non-cleared swaps, forwards,
	options and swaps will be calculated by the Administrator using market quotations and market data, if available, or other information
	customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE or 4:00 p.m. E.T. Money
	market funds will be valued at their end of day NAV. The Funds may hold cash in the form of U.S. dollars.




	 








	78










	 









	Third
	parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, information vendors, dealers in the relevant markets,
	end-users of the relevant product, brokers and other sources of market information. Other information customarily used in determining
	fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including,
	without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in
	the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type
	used by a Fund in the regular course of business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs
	of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.




	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market
	professionals, NYSE will calculate and disseminate throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative
	fund value. The indicative fund value will be calculated by using the prior day’s closing NAV per share of the Fund as a
	base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active
	light, sweet Oil Futures Contract on the NYMEX. The prices reported for the active Oil Futures Contract month are adjusted based
	on the prior day’s spread differential between settlement values for that contract and the spot month contract. In the event
	that the spot month contract is also the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the last sale price for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
	is not adjusted. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE core trading session hours should not be viewed
	as an actual real time update of the NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based
	upon the relevant end of day values of the Fund’s investments.




	The indicative
	fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update
	of the NAV, because NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the
	Fund’s investments.




	The indicative fund value will be disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE core
	trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 9:00 a.m.
	New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there will be a gap in time at the end of each day during which the Fund’s
	shares are traded on the NYSE, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for oil futures contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available.
	During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Oil Futures Contracts
	from the NYMEX’s immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other Oil Futures Contracts, Other Oil-Related Investments
	and Treasuries held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third
	party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund
	value.




	NYSE will
	disseminate the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value
	will be published on NYSE’ website and will be available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.




	Dissemination
	of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors
	and market professionals in connection with the trading of the shares of the Fund on NYSE. Investors and market professionals
	will be able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value. If the market price
	of the shares of the Fund diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to
	execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value,
	a market professional could buy shares of the Fund on NYSE and sell short oil futures contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten
	the tracking between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.







	Creation and Redemption
	of Shares





	 




	The Fund intends
	to create and redeem shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and
	redemption of baskets will be made only in exchange for delivery to the Fund or the distribution by the Fund of the amount of
	Treasuries and/or cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be equal to the combined
	NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the
	day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.




	 








	79










	 







	Authorized Participants
	will be the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered
	broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required
	to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an
	Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF. The Authorized Participant Agreement
	will provide the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required
	for such creation and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended
	by the Fund, without the consent of any limited partner or Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants pay
	a transaction fee equal to 0.04% of total NAV of the Creation Baskets to the Fund for each order they place to create one or more
	Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed
	by USCF. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commission or other
	form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Fund or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility
	to USCF or the Fund to effect any sale or resale of shares.




	Certain
	Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil
	futures market. In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell crude oil or Oil
	Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely
	that an Authorized Participant’s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will significantly affect the
	price of crude oil, Oil Interests or the price of the shares.




	Each Authorized
	Participant will be required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and a member in good standing with FINRA,
	or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and will be qualified
	to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized
	Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own
	set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory
	regime.




	Under
	the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and the Trust under limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the Authorized Participants
	against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants
	may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.




	The following
	description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the
	relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail. The Trust Agreement
	is attached to this prospectus. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part. See “Where You Can Find More Information” for information about where you can
	obtain the registration statement.






	Creation Procedures






	 




	On
	any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For
	purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a “business day” means any day other than a day when NYSE
	or any futures exchange upon which a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is traded is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders
	must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on NYSE, whichever is earlier. The day on which
	the Marketing Agent accepts a purchase order in satisfactory form and approves such order in accordance with the procedures
	set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as the purchase order date.




	By placing
	a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the
	Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired
	to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation
	request.




	 




	The manner by
	which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized
	Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian of the Fund,
	and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or
	exchange for swap, or any other OTC transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with the Fund for the purchase
	of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. If an
	Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and types of contracts specified
	shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet the Fund’s investment objective and shall be purchased as a
	result of the Authorized Participant’s purchase of shares.

	Determination of Required
	Deposits






	 




	The total deposit
	required to create each basket (“Creation Basket Deposit”) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the
	same proportion to the total assets of the Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on
	the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of
	shares outstanding on the purchase order date. USCF intends to determine, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with
	the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions
	of Treasuries and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the
	Creation Basket Deposit requirements at the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference
	between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New
	York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.






	Delivery of Required
	Deposits






	 




	An Authorized
	Participant who places a purchase order will be responsible for transferring to the Fund’s account with the Custodian the
	required amount of Treasuries and/or cash by noon New York time on the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon
	receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator will direct DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant’s
	DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries
	until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of the Fund shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.




	Because
	orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during
	the continuous offering period will not be determined until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received,
	Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable
	purchase order for the basket. The Fund’s NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise
	or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price
	in respect thereof is determined.






	Rejection of Purchase
	Orders






	 




	USCF acting by
	itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right, but shall have no obligation, to reject any purchase order
	or Creation Basket Deposit if USCF determines that:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	the purchase order
	or Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	it would not be in
	the best interest of the shareholders of the Fund;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	due to position limits
	or otherwise, investment alternatives that will enable the Fund to meet its investment objective are not available to the
	Fund at that time;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	the acceptance of
	the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to the Fund or its shareholders;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	the acceptance or
	receipt of which would, in the opinion of counsel to USCF, be unlawful; or






	 






	 




	•




	 




	circumstances outside
	the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process Creation
	Baskets (including if USCF determines that the investments available to the Fund at that time will not enable it to meet its
	investment objective).





	 


	 


	 


	 





	None of
	USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.






	Redemption Procedures






	 




	The procedures
	by which an Authorized Participant will be able to redeem one or more baskets will mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.
	On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption
	orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on NYSE, whichever is earlier. A redemption
	order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form and approved by the Marketing Agent (“Redemption Order Date”) in
	accordance with the procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants
	to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket,
	or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.




	 








	81










	 











	By placing
	a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system
	to the Fund not later than noon New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order.
	Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to
	USCF’s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. An Authorized Participant
	may not withdraw a redemption order.




	The manner
	by which redemptions will be made will be dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption
	order, an Authorized Participant will be agreeing to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC’s
	book-entry system to the Fund’s account with the Custodian no later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day
	following the effective date of the redemption order (“Redemption Order Date”), and (2) if required by USCF in
	its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC
	transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with the Fund for the purchase of a number and type of futures
	contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails
	to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by
	USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet the Fund’s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant’s
	sale of shares.






	Determination of Redemption
	Distribution






	 




	The redemption
	distribution from the Fund will consist of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or
	cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other
	liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption
	order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation
	with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries
	and proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish
	an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.




	 






	Delivery of Redemption Distribution






	 




	The redemption
	distribution due from the Fund will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on the third business day following the redemption
	order date if, by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such third business day, the Fund’s DTC account has been credited with the
	baskets to be redeemed. If the Fund’s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time,
	the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution
	will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if USCF receives the fee applicable
	to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to
	be redeemed are credited to the Fund’s DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding
	amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to
	deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund’s DTC account
	by 3:00 p.m., New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized
	its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC’s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.






	Suspension or Rejection
	of Redemption Orders






	 




	USCF may, in
	its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which
	NYSE or any of the futures exchanges upon which a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is traded is closed other than customary weekend
	or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE or such futures exchanges is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which
	an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for
	such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that
	it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of the Fund’s assets at an appropriate value
	to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating the Fund’s positions,

	e.g.

	, because of a market disruption
	event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract, it may
	be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing Agent,
	or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or
	postponement.




	 








	82










	 









	Redemption
	orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, reject
	any Redemption Order (1) USCF determines that the Redemption Order is not in proper form, (2) the fulfillment of which
	its counsel advises may be illegal under applicable laws and regulations, or (3) if circumstances outside the control of
	USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible for the shares to be delivered under
	the Redemption Order. USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining
	outstanding shares to 100,000 shares (

	i.e.

	, two (2) baskets) or less.






	Creation and Redemption
	Transaction Fee






	 




	To compensate
	the Fund for expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay
	a transaction fee to the Fund equal to 0.04% of total NAV of the Creation Baskets to create or redeem baskets. The transaction
	fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will
	not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until thirty (30) days after the date of notice.




	 






	Tax Responsibility






	 




	Authorized Participants
	are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental
	charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly
	on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and the Fund if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together
	with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.






	Secondary Market Transactions






	 




	As noted, the
	Fund will create and redeem shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation
	and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Fund or the distribution by the Fund of the amount of
	Treasuries and/or cash equal to the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined
	on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.




	As discussed above, Authorized Participants will be the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem
	baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other
	financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized
	Participant will be under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant will be under no obligation
	to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the
	baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price
	of the shares on NYSE, the NAV of the shares at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets, the NAV of
	the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the
	liquidity of the Oil Futures Contract market and the market for Other Oil-Related Investments. Baskets will generally be redeemed
	when the price per share is at a discount to the NAV per share. Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized
	Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed
	by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Fund in exchange
	for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Fund or USCF
	and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or the Fund to effect any sale or resale of shares. Shares trade
	in the secondary market on NYSE. Shares are expected to trade in the secondary market on NYSE. Shares may trade in the secondary
	market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their NAV per share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading
	price relative to the NAV per share may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase
	or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Oil Futures Contract market and the market for Other Oil-Related
	Investments. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the
	market for Oil Interests may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, during this time,
	trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.

	Use of Proceeds





	 




	USCF will cause
	the Fund to transfer the proceeds of the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities.
	USCF will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Interests. When the Fund purchases Oil Interests that are exchange-traded, the
	Fund will be required to deposit typically 5% to 30% with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract
	or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known
	as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally impose similar collateral requirements on the
	Fund. USCF will invest the Fund’s assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash
	equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets
	that will be:




	 






	 




	•




	 




	held as margin or
	collateral with FCMs or other custodians;






	 






	 




	•




	 




	used for other investments;
	and






	 






	 




	•




	 




	held in bank accounts
	to pay current obligations and as reserves.






	 




	Approximately
	15% to 90% of the Fund’s assets will be committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time,
	the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range. Ongoing margin and collateral
	payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil Interests.
	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected
	by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure
	under the Oil Interests, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments
	under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible
	to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries,
	cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral
	requirements. All interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. USCF invests the balance of the Fund’s assets
	not invested in Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to be available for changes in margin. All interest income is used
	for the Fund’s benefit.




	An FCM,
	counterparty, government agency or exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading
	positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any
	positions held.




	The assets
	of the Fund posted as margin for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts or other exchange-traded futures contracts will be held in
	segregation pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.




	If the
	Fund enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount
	of collateral the Fund posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Fund to its counterparty on a given swap transaction,
	while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by the Fund at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent
	amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.







	Additional Information
	About the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and the Fund’s Trading Program





	 




	The overall return
	on the Fund is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, and (ii) a
	daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on hypothetical 3-month Treasuries, calculated using the weekly auction
	rate for 3-Month Treasuries published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.




	Table 1 below lists the Futures Exchange on which the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts is listed and quotation
	details. Table 2 lists the other exchange-traded futures contracts in which the Fund expects to invest.

	STATEMENT
	REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	This prospectus
	includes “forward-looking statements” which generally relate to future events or future performance. In some cases,
	you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,”
	“expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,”
	“potential” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements
	of historical fact) included in this prospectus that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the
	future, including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements, the Fund’s
	operations, USCF’s plans and references to the Fund’s future success and other similar matters, are forward-looking
	statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based
	upon certain assumptions and analyses USCF has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected
	future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments
	will conform to USCF’s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including
	the special considerations discussed in this prospectus, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or
	regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic
	and political developments. See “Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund” Consequently, all the forward-looking
	statements made in this prospectus are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results
	or developments USCF anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences
	to, or have the expected effects on, the Fund’s operations or the value of the Fund’s shares.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
	REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 



	 


	To the Board
	of Trustees and Shareholder of USCF Funds Trust:


	We have audited
	the accompanying statements of financial condition of the USCF Funds Trust (the “Trust”), the REX S&P MLP Fund,
	the REX S&P MLP Inverse Fund, the United States 3x Oil Fund and the United States 3x Short Oil Fund (collectively, the “Series”),
	in total and for the Series as of June 26, 2017. These statements of financial condition are the responsibility of the Trust’s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits.


	We conducted
	our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements of financial condition are free
	of material misstatement. The Trust and the Series are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, audits of the internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the Trust’s or the Series’ internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no opinion. An audit
	also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
	the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion,
	the statements of financial condition referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
	USCF Funds Trust, the REX S&P MLP Fund, the REX S&P MLP Inverse Fund, the United States 3x Oil Fund and the United States
	3x Short Oil Fund as of June 26, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	JUNE 26, 2017




	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION



	The USCF Funds Trust
	(the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on March 2, 2016. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant
	to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Trust contains four Funds within the series; REX S&P MLP Fund
	(“RMLP”), REX S&P MLP Inverse Fund (“MLPD”), United States 3x Oil Fund (“USOU”) and
	United States 3x Short Oil Fund (“USOD”) (each series, a “Fund” and collectively, the
	“Funds”). RMLP and MLPD are commodity pools that are expected to issue shares that would be purchased and sold on
	an exchange. USOU and USOD are commodity pools that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be
	purchased and sold on NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. stock exchange (“NYSE”). The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant
	to the Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”), dated
	as of June 23, 2017. The sole trustee of the Trust is Wilmington Trust Company, National Association, a national banking
	association, with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware (the “Trustee”). The Trust and the Funds are managed and
	operated by the United States Commodity Funds, LLC (“USCF” or the “Sponsor”). USCF is a limited
	liability company formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”)
	with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member of the National Futures Association
	(“NFA”).


	The Sponsor shall have the power
	and authority to establish and designate one or more series, or funds, and to issue shares thereof, from time to time as it deems
	necessary or desirable. The Sponsor shall have the exclusive power to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences as
	between the shares of any series as to right of redemption, special and relative rights as to dividends and other distributions
	and on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the series shall have separate voting rights or no voting rights.
	The term for which the Trust will exist commenced on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Trust, and the Trust and any
	Fund will exist in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Each Fund is
	separate from all other Funds created as series of the Trust in respect of the assets and liabilities allocated to that Fund and
	each Fund represents a separate investment portfolio of the Trust. Separate and distinct records must be maintained for each Fund
	and the assets associated with a Fund shall be held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including a
	nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the assets of any other Fund.


	The Trustee is not affiliated with the
	Sponsor. The Trustee will accept legal service of process on the Trust in the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under
	the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Trustee’s duties and liabilities with respect to the offering of Shares and the management
	of the Trust are limited to its express obligations under the Trust Agreement and the Trustee does not owe any other duties to
	the Trust, the Sponsor or the shareholders of the Fund.


	The Sponsor, is also the general
	partner of the United States Oil Fund, LP (“USO”), the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (“UNG”), the
	United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (“USL”), the United States Gasoline Fund, LP (“UGA”) and the United
	States Diesel-Heating Oil Fund, LP (“UHN”), which listed their limited partnership shares on the American Stock Exchange
	(the “AMEX”) under the ticker symbols “USO” on April 10, 2006, “UNG” on April 18,
	2007, “USL” on December 6, 2007, “UGA” on February 26, 2008 and “UHN” on April 9,
	2008, respectively. As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, each of USO’s, UNG’s, USL’s,
	UGA’s and UHN’s shares commenced trading on the NYSE on November 25, 2008. USCF is also the general partner
	of the United States Short Oil Fund, LP (“DNO”), the United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP (“UNL”)
	and the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP (“BNO”), which listed their limited partnership shares on the NYSE under the
	ticker symbols “DNO” on September 24, 2009, “UNL” on November 18, 2009 and “BNO”
	on June 2, 2010, respectively. USCF is also the sponsor of the United States Commodity Index Fund (“USCI”), the
	United States Copper Index Fund (“CPER”), the United States Agriculture Index Fund (“USAG”), and the USCF
	Canadian Crude Oil Index Fund (“UCCO”), each a series of the United States Commodity Index Funds Trust. USCI, CPER
	and USAG listed their shares on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “USCI” on August 10, 2010, “CPER”
	on November 15, 2011 and “USAG” on April 13, 2012, respectively. UCCO is currently in registration and has
	not commenced operations.

	All funds listed previously,
	other than UCCO, are referred to collectively herein as the “Related Public Funds” and are also commodity pools. In
	addition, the Funds are currently in registration and have not commenced operations and are not included in the Related Public
	Funds.


	The following summary of significant
	accounting policies will be followed by the Trust and the Funds once operations commence.



	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements have been prepared
	in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), as detailed in the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification. Each series of the Trust is an investment company
	and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB Topic 946.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Commodity futures contracts, forward contracts,
	physical commodities, and related options are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified
	cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are reflected in the condensed statements
	of financial condition and represent the difference between the original contract amount and the market value (as determined by
	exchange settlement prices for futures contracts and related options and cash dealer prices at a predetermined time for forward
	contracts, physical commodities, and their related options) as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the condensed
	financial statements. Changes in the unrealized gains or losses between periods are reflected in the condensed statements
	of operations. The Funds earn income on funds held at the custodian or futures commission merchant (“FCM”) at prevailing
	market rates earned on such investments.


	 



	Brokerage Commissions



	 


	Brokerage commissions on all open commodity
	futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Funds are taxed in a manner similar to
	a limited partnership. The Funds are not subject to federal income taxes; each partner reports his/her allocable share of income,
	gain, loss deductions or credits on his/her own income tax return.


	  



	Creations and Redemptions




	 



	“Authorized Participants,”
	institutional firms that can purchase or redeem shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called “baskets” through the Fund’s
	marketing agent, may purchase or redeem baskets only in blocks of 50,000 shares at a price equal to the NAV of the shares calculated
	shortly after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE on the day the order is placed. 


	 


	The Funds receive or pay the proceeds from
	shares sold or redeemed within three business days after the trade date of the purchase or redemption. The amounts due from Authorized
	Participants are reflected in the Funds’ condensed statements of financial condition as receivable for shares sold, and amounts
	payable to Authorized Participants upon redemption are reflected as payable for shares redeemed.


	 


	For USOU or USOD, Authorized Participants
	will pay a transaction fee equal to 0.04% of total NAV of baskets to the Fund for each order placed to create or redeem one
	or more baskets. For RMLP or MLPD, Authorized Participants will pay a transaction fee equal to 0.02% of total NAV of baskets to the Fund for
	each order placed to create or redeem one or more baskets.


	 










	 


	F-

	Trust Capital and Allocation of Income and
	Losses



	 


	The Trust is a treated as partnership for tax
	purposes. Profit or loss shall be allocated among the partners of the Fund in proportion to the number of shares each partner holds
	as of the close of each month. USCF may revise, alter or otherwise modify this method of allocation as described in the Trust Agreement.



	 




	Calculation of Per Share NAV



	 


	RMLP and MLPD Funds’ per share NAV will
	be calculated on each exchange trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities
	and dividing the amount by the total number of shares issued and outstanding. Each Fund will use the closing prices on the relevant
	futures exchanges of the applicable Benchmark Futures Contracts (as defined in Note 3 below) that at any given time make up the
	applicable index (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 4:00 p.m. New York time) for the contracts traded
	on the futures exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of the Funds using market quotations,
	if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments.


	 


	USOU and USOD Funds’ per share NAV is
	calculated on each NYSE trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing
	that amount by the total number of shares outstanding. The Funds use the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange
	on that day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange.


	 



	Net Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Net income (loss) per share is the difference
	between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period. The weighted average number of shares
	outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average share. The weighted average shares are
	equal to the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for shares added and redeemed based
	on the amount of time the shares were outstanding during such period.




	 





	Offering Costs



	 


	Offering costs incurred in connection with
	the registration of additional shares after the initial registration of shares are borne by each respective Fund. These costs include registration
	fees paid to regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offerings. These costs
	are accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter
	period if warranted.



	 




	Cash Equivalents



	 


	Cash equivalents include money market funds, overnight deposits and obligations of the United States with an original maturity of less than six months.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of condensed financial statements
	in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires USCF to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts
	of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.


	 



	NOTE 3

	-

	TRUST SERIES




	 



	The Sponsor contributed an aggregate
	of $4,000 to the Trust, $1,000 on March 31, 2016 for RMLP, $1,000 on April 15, 2016 for MLPD, $1,000 on June 20, 2017 for USOU
	and $1,000 on June 20, 2017 for USOD, representing an initial contribution of capital to the Trust for each series. Pursuant to
	the Trust Agreement, four series will be designated and the Funds will be designated as a series of the Trust. Following the designation
	of the Funds as a series of the Trust, an initial capital contribution of $1,000 will be made to each respective Fund and deemed an initial
	contribution of capital to each respective Fund. In connection with the planned commencement of trading for the Fund under the Funds ticker
	the initial offering of shares, USCF will receive 40 Sponsor Shares of each respective Fund in exchange for the previously received capital
	contribution, representing a beneficial ownership interest in each respective Fund.

	Investment Objective of the Funds




	 




	RMLP




	 



	RMLP’s shares will trade on a to be determined
	exchange. The investment objective of RMLP is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset
	value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the S&P MLP Total Return Index Futures (the “Benchmark
	Futures Contract”), less RMLP’s expenses and distributions made by RMLP. The S&P MLP Total Return Index (the “Index”)
	is designed to measure the total return performance of leading master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) and publicly traded
	limited liability companies (“LLCs”), which have a similar legal structure to MLPs and share the same tax benefits,
	that trade on major U.S. exchanges. As the vast majority of traded partnerships have operations in the oil and gas industries,
	the Index focuses on companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard’s (“GICS®”) Energy Sector and
	the GICS Gas Utilities Industry. The Index is owned, maintained, calculated, and published by S&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC (the
	“Index Sponsor”).



	 




	MLPD



	 


	MLPD’s shares will trade on a to be determined
	exchange. The investment objective of MLPD is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share NAV to reflect
	the inverse of the daily changes in percentage terms of the Benchmark Futures Contract, less MLPD’s expenses. MLPD seeks
	a return that is -100% of the return of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a single day. MLPD should not be expected to provide
	100% of the inverse of the cumulative return for the Benchmark Futures Contract for periods greater than a day. The Index is designed
	to measure the total return performance of leading MLPs and publicly traded LLCs, which have a similar legal structure to MLPs
	and share the same tax benefits, that trade on major U.S. exchanges. As the vast majority of traded partnerships have operations
	in the oil and gas industries, the Index focuses on companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard’s (“GICS®”)
	Energy Sector and the GICS Gas Utilities Industry. The Index is owned, maintained, calculated, and published by the Index Sponsor.


	 


	Each of these Funds will seek to achieve
	its investment objective by primarily investing in Benchmark Futures Contracts. If constrained by regulatory requirements or
	in view of market conditions, each Fund will invest next in other exchange-traded futures contracts and options contracts, if
	available, based on the Index, other MLP indices or individual MLPs. If constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of
	market conditions, each of the Funds will invest next in over the counter (“OTC”) swaps on the Index, other MLP
	indices or individual MLPs. Other exchange-traded futures contracts, options contracts and OTC swaps based on the Index,
	other MLP indices or individual MLPs are collectively referred to as “Related Investments,” and together with
	Benchmark Futures Contracts, the “MLP Interests.”



	 




	USOU



	 


	USOU’s shares will trade
	on the NYSE. The investment objective of the Fund will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share
	net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified
	short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil (the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract”) less the Fund’s
	expenses. To achieve this objective, USCF will endeavor to have the notional value of the Fund’s aggregate exposure to the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund will
	seek a return that is 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day and does not seek to achieve its
	stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day.


	The pursuit of daily leveraged
	investment goals means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to 300%
	of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return
	of the Fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns.

	USOD



	USOD’s shares will trade
	on the NYSE. The investment objective of the Fund will be for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share
	net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times the inverse (-3x) of the daily change in percentage terms of the price
	of a specified short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil (the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract”) less the
	Fund’s expenses. To achieve this objective, USCF will endeavor to have the notional value of the Fund’s aggregate short
	exposure to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to 300% of the Fund’s
	NAV. The Fund will seek a return that is -300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day and does not
	seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day.


	The pursuit of daily inverse
	leveraged investment goals means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance
	to -300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate
	return of the Fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns.
