About Us – Xencor





































 

 


 







Redesigning Antibody Drugs from the Ground Up

To create its XmAb antibody engineering platform, Xencor precisely alters the Fc domain — the stem of the antibody structure — to significantly enhance natural functions and performance. In some cases, these modifications create entirely new therapeutic mechanisms of action.

Xencor’s broad portfolio of optimized Fc domains can plug-and-play into nearly any antibody. XmAb Fc domains provide enhanced performance in 11 proprietary and partnered therapeutic antibody programs in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, cancer, asthma and allergic diseases.

PartneringPartners Broaden the Pipeline of XmAb Drug Candidates
The plug-and-play nature of Xencor’s XmAb technology enables the rapid creation of more powerful, more effective antibodies by simply changing a few amino acids in the Fc domain to the amino acids identified by our structure-based design. Typically two amino acids are changed to create the XmAb Fc domain and dramatically enhance the biological function of the antibody. Xencor’s growing pipeline is based on this plug-and-play approach to creating differentiated antibody drug candidates.
Xencor extends the use of the XmAb technology through licenses of these high-performance Fc domains to partners interested in therapeutic targets outside of Xencor’s areas of focus. Currently, partners are advancing seven programs in clinical trials and numerous pre-clinical programs that use XmAb Fc domains for bispecific structure, higher cytotoxicity, longer half-life or improved stability.

Please direct partnering inquiries to: collaborate@xencor.com


Current partners include

Novartis licensed ex-US commercial rights and entered a collaboration for the worldwide development of XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, and began a collaboration to use XmAb Bispecific Fc Domains across 4 Novartis programs; Novartis also licensed various XmAb Fc Domains to optimize the performance of therapeutic antibodies.


Xencor and Amgen entered into a collaboration to use XmAb Bispecific Fc Domains across six programs in cancer immunotherapy and inflammation, including CD38xCD3 bispecific antibodies discovered at Xencor for myeloma.


Xencor’s Xtend and Cytotoxic Fc Domains are helping Janssen optimize performance of its therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.


Merck has licensed Xencor XmAb technology to create enhanced performance in a therapeutic biologic program that are currently in Phase 1 clinical trials.


MorphoSys has licensed worldwide rights for XmAb5574/MOR208, a B-cell targeting antibody with an XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain that is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Xencor discovered and developed XmAb5574/MOR208 through Phase 1 clinical trials.

Boehringer Ingelheim is using XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domains to improve potency against tumor targets in two programs in Phase 1 testing.


CSL is using an XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain to enhance the ADCC effector function of a therapeutic antibody in Phase 2 testing, CSL362 now called JNJ-56022473, for acute myeloid leukemia.


Xencor is collaborating with Alexion to create next generation monoclonal antibodies with greatly improved pharmacokinetics. Alexion is using Xencor’s Xtend™ Fc domain to enhance the half-life of its therapeutic antibodies, with the most advanced program in Phase 2 testing.
