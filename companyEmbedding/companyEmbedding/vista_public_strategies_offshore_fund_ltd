What is a 'Hedge Fund'
Hedge funds are alternative investments using pooled funds that employ numerous different strategies to earn active return, or alpha, for their investors. Hedge funds may be aggressively managed or make use of derivatives and leverage in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns (either in an absolute sense or over a specified market benchmark). It is important to note that hedge funds are generally only accessible to accredited investors as they require less SEC regulations than other funds. One aspect that has set the hedge fund industry apart is the fact that hedge funds face less regulation than mutual funds and other investment vehicles.

BREAKING DOWN 'Hedge Fund'
Each hedge fund is constructed to take advantage of certain identifiable market opportunities. Hedge funds use different investment strategies and thus are often classified according to investment style. There is substantial diversity in risk attributes and investments among styles.
Legally, hedge funds are most often set up as private investment limited partnerships that are open to a limited number of accredited investors and require a large initial minimum investment. Investments in hedge funds are illiquid as they often require investors keep their money in the fund for at least one year, a time known as the lock-up period. Withdrawals may also only happen at certain intervals such as quarterly or bi-annually.
The History of the Hedge Fund 
Former writer and sociologist Alfred Winslow Jones’s company, A.W. Jones & Co. launched the first hedge fund in 1949. It was while writing an article about current investment trends for Fortune in 1948 that Jones was inspired to try his hand at managing money. He raised $100,000 (including $40,000 out of his own pocket) and set forth to try to minimize the risk in holding long-term stock positions by short selling other stocks. This investing innovation is now referred to as the classic long/short equities model. Jones also employed leverage to enhance returns.
In 1952, Jones altered the structure of his investment vehicle, converting it from a general partnership to a limited partnership and adding a 20% incentive fee as compensation for the managing partner. As the first money manager to combine short selling, the use of leverage, shared risk through a partnership with other investors and a compensation system based on investment performance, Jones earned his place in investing history as the father of the hedge fund.
Hedge funds went on to dramatically outperform most mutual funds in the 1960s and gained further popularity when a 1966 article in Fortune highlighted an obscure investment that outperformed every mutual fund on the market by double-digit figures over the past year and by high double-digits over the last five years.
However, as hedge fund trends evolved, in an effort to maximize returns, many funds turned away from Jones' strategy, which focused on stock picking coupled with hedging and chose instead to engage in riskier strategies based on long-term leverage. These tactics led to heavy losses in 1969-70, followed by a number of hedge fund closures during the bear market of 1973-74.
The industry was relatively quiet for more than two decades until a 1986 article in Institutional Investor touted the double-digit performance of Julian Robertson's Tiger Fund. With a high-flying hedge fund once again capturing the public's attention with its stellar performance, investors flocked to an industry that now offered thousands of funds and an ever-increasing array of exotic strategies, including currency trading and derivatives such as futures and options.
High-profile money managers deserted the traditional mutual fund industry in droves in the early 1990s, seeking fame and fortune as hedge fund managers. Unfortunately, history repeated itself in the late 1990s and into the early 2000s as a number of high-profile hedge funds, including Robertson's, failed in spectacular fashion. Since that era, the hedge fund industry has grown substantially. Today the hedge fund industry is massive—total assets under management in the industry is valued at more than $3.2 trillion according to the 2016 Preqin Global Hedge Fund Report. 
The number of operating hedge funds has grown as well. There were around 2,000 hedge funds in 2002. That number increased to over 10,000 by 2015. However, in 2016, the number of hedge funds is currently on a decline again according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Below is a description of the characteristics common to most contemporary hedge funds. 
Key Characteristics of Hedge Funds 
1. They're only open to "accredited" or qualified investors:  Hedge funds are only allowed to take money from "qualified" investors—individuals with an annual income that exceeds $200,000 for the past two years or a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding their primary residence. As such, the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified investors suitable enough to handle the potential risks that come from a wider investment mandate. 
2. They offer wider investment latitude than other funds: A hedge fund's investment universe is only limited by its mandate. A hedge fund can basically invest in anything—land, real estate, stocks, derivatives, and currencies. Mutual funds, by contrast, have to basically stick to stocks or bonds, and are usually long-only.
3. They often employ leverage: Hedge funds will often use borrowed money to amplify their returns. As we saw during the financial crisis of 2008, leverage can also wipe out hedge funds.
4. Fee structure: Instead of charging an expense ratio only, hedge funds charge both an expense ratio and a performance fee. This fee structure is known as "Two and Twenty"—a 2% asset management fee and then a 20% cut of any gains generated.
There are more specific characteristics that define a hedge fund, but basically, because they are private investment vehicles that only allow wealthy individuals to invest, hedge funds can pretty much do what they want as long as they disclose the strategy upfront to investors. This wide latitude may sound very risky, and at times it can be. Some of the most spectacular financial blow-ups have involved hedge funds. That said, this flexibility afforded to hedge funds has led to some of the most talented money managers producing some amazing long-term returns.
The first hedge fund was established in the late 1940s as a long/short hedged equity vehicle. More recently, institutional investors – corporate and public pension funds, endowments and trusts, and bank trust departments—have included hedge funds as one segment of a well-diversified portfolio.
It is important to note that "hedging" is actually the practice of attempting to reduce risk, but the goal of most hedge funds is to maximize return on investment. The name is mostly historical, as the first hedge funds tried to hedge against the downside risk of a bear market by shorting the market. (Mutual funds generally don't enter into short positions as one of their primary goals). Nowadays, hedge funds use dozens of different strategies, so it isn't accurate to say that hedge funds just "hedge risk." In fact, because hedge fund managers make speculative investments, these funds can carry more risk than the overall market.
Below are some of the risks of hedge funds:
  1. Concentrated investment strategy exposes hedge funds to potentially huge losses.
  2. Hedge funds typically require investors to lock up money for a period of years.
  3. Use of leverage, or borrowed money, can turn what would have been a minor loss into a significant loss.
Hedge Fund Strategies
There are numerous strategies that managers employ but below is a general overview of common strategies.
Equity market neutral: These funds attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued equity securities while neutralizing the portfolio’s exposure to market risk by combining long and short positions. Portfolios are typically structured to be market, industry, sector, and dollar neutral, with a portfolio beta around zero. This is accomplished by holding long and short equity positions with roughly equal exposure to the related market or sector factors. Because this style seeks an absolute return, the benchmark is typically the risk-free rate. 
Convertible arbitrage: These strategies attempt to exploit mis-pricings in corporate convertible securities, such as convertible bonds, warrants, and convertible preferred stock. Managers in this category buy or sell these securities and then hedge part or all of the associated risks. The simplest example is buying convertible bonds and hedging the equity component of the bonds’ risk by shorting the associated stock. In addition to collecting the coupon on the underlying convertible bond, convertible arbitrage strategies can make money if the expected volatility of the underlying asset increases due to the embedded option, or if the price of the underlying asset increases rapidly. Depending on the hedge strategy, the strategy will also make money if the credit quality of the issuer improves.
Fixed-income arbitrage: These funds attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued fixed-income securities (bonds) primarily on the basis of expectations of changes in the term structure or the credit quality of various related issues or market sectors. Fixed-income portfolios are generally neutralized against directional market movements because the portfolios combine long and short positions, therefore the portfolio duration is close to zero.
Distressed securities: Portfolios of distressed securities are invested in both the debt and equity of companies that are in or near bankruptcy. Most investors are not prepared for the legal difficulties and negotiations with creditors and other claimants that are common with distressed companies. Traditional investors prefer to transfer those risks to others when a company is in danger of default. Furthermore, many investors are prevented from holding securities that are in default or at risk of default. Because of the relative illiquidity of distressed debt and equity, short sales are difficult, so most funds are long.
Merger arbitrage: Merger arbitrage, also called “deal arbitrage,” seeks to capture the price spread between current market prices of corporate securities and their value upon successful completion of a takeover, merger, spin-off, or similar transaction involving more than one company. In merger arbitrage, the opportunity typically involves buying the stock of a target company after a merger announcement and shorting an appropriate amount of the acquiring company’s stock.
Hedged equity: Hedged equity strategies attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued equity securities. Portfolios are typically not structured to be market, industry, sector, and dollar neutral, and they may be highly concentrated. For example, the value of short positions may be only a fraction of the value of long positions and the portfolio may have a net long exposure to the equity market. Hedged equity is the largest of the various hedge fund strategies in terms of assets under management. It is also known as the long/short equity strategy.
Global macro: Global macro strategies primarily attempt to take advantage of systematic moves in major financial and non-financial markets through trading in currencies, futures, and option contracts, although they may also take major positions in traditional equity and bond markets. For the most part, they differ from traditional hedge fund strategies in that they concentrate on major market trends rather than on individual security opportunities. Many global macro managers use derivatives, such as futures and options, in their strategies. Managed futures are sometimes classified under global macro as a result.
Emerging markets: These funds focus on the emerging and less mature markets. Because short selling is not permitted in most emerging markets and because futures and options may not available, these funds tend to be long.
Fund of funds: A fund of funds (FOF) is a fund that invests in a number of underlying hedge funds. A typical FOF invests in 10-30 hedge funds and some FOFs are even more diversified. Although FOF investors can achieve diversification among hedge fund managers and strategies, they have to pay two layers of fees: one to the hedge fund manager, and the other to the manager of the FOF. FOF are typically more accessible to individual investors and are more liquid. 
Hedge Fund Manager Pay Structure 
Hedge fund managers are notorious for their typical 2 and 20 pay structure whereby the fund manager to receive 2% of assets and 20% of profits each year. It's the 2% that gets the criticism, and it's not difficult to see why. Even if the hedge fund manager loses money, he still gets 2% of assets. For example, a manager overseeing a $1 billion fund could pocket $20 million a year in compensation without lifting a finger. 
That said, there are mechanisms put in place to help protect those who invest in hedge funds. Often times, fee limitations such as high-water marks are employed to prevent portfolio managers from getting paid on the same returns twice. Fee caps may also be in place to prevent managers from taking on excess risk.
How to Pick a Hedge Fund 
With so many hedge funds in the investment universe, it is important that investors know what they are looking for in order to streamline the due diligence process and make timely and appropriate decisions. 
When looking for a high-quality hedge fund, it is important for an investor to identify the metrics that are important to them and the results required for each. These guidelines can be based on absolute values, such as returns that exceed 20% per year over the previous five years, or they can be relative, such as the top five highest-performing funds in a particular category.
Absolute Performance Guidelines
The first guideline an investor should set when selecting a fund is the annualized rate of return. Let's say that we want to find funds with a five-year annualized return that exceeds the return on the Citigroup World Government Bond Index (WGBI) by 1%. This filter would eliminate all funds that underperform the index over long time periods, and it could be adjusted based on the performance of the index over time. 
This guideline will also reveal funds with much higher expected returns, such as global macro funds, long-biased long/short funds, and several others. But if these aren't the types of funds the investor is looking for, then they must also establish a guideline for standard deviation. Once again, we will use the WGBI to calculate the standard deviation for the index over the previous five years. Let's assume we add 1% to this result, and establish that value as the guideline for standard deviation. Funds with a standard deviation greater than the guideline can also be eliminated from further consideration.
Unfortunately, high returns do not necessarily help to identify an attractive fund. In some cases, a hedge fund may have employed a strategy that was in favor, which drove performance to be higher than normal for its category. Therefore, once certain funds have been identified as high-return performers, it is important to identify the fund's strategy and compare its returns to other funds in the same category. To do this, an investor can establish guidelines by first generating a peer analysis of similar funds. For example, one might establish the 50th percentile as the guideline for filtering funds. 
Now an investor has two guidelines that all funds need to meet for further consideration. However, applying these two guidelines still leaves too many funds to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time. Additional guidelines need to be established, but the additional guidelines will not necessarily apply across the remaining universe of funds. For example, the guidelines for a merger arbitrage fund will differ from those for a long-short market-neutral fund.
Relative Performance Guidelines
To facilitate the investor's search for high-quality funds that not only meet the initial return and risk guidelines but also meet strategy-specific guidelines, the next step is to establish a set of relative guidelines. Relative performance metrics should always be based on specific categories or strategies. For example, it would not be fair to compare a leveraged global macro fund with a market-neutral, long/short equity fund.
To establish guidelines for a specific strategy, an investor can use an analytical software package (such as Morningstar) to first identify a universe of funds using similar strategies. Then, a peer analysis will reveal many statistics, broken down into quartiles or deciles, for that universe.
The threshold for each guideline may be the result for each metric that meets or exceeds the 50th percentile. An investor can loosen the guidelines by using the 60th percentile or tighten the guideline by using the 40th percentile. Using the 50th percentile across all the metrics usually filters out all but a few hedge funds for additional consideration. In addition, establishing the guidelines this way allows for flexibility to adjust the guidelines as the economic environment may impact the absolute returns for some strategies.
Here is a sound list of primary metrics to use for setting guidelines:
Five-year annualized returns
Standard deviation
Rolling standard deviation
Months to recovery/maximum drawdown
Downside deviation
These guidelines will help eliminate many of the funds in the universe and identify a workable number of funds for further analysis. An investor may also want to consider other guidelines that can either further reduce the number of funds to analyze or to identify funds that meet additional criteria that may be relevant to the investor. Some examples of other guidelines include:
Fund Size/Firm Size: The guideline for size may be a minimum or maximum depending on the investor's preference. For example, institutional investors often invest such large amounts that a fund or firm must have a minimum size to accommodate a large investment. For other investors, a fund that is too big may face future challenges using the same strategy to match past successes. Such might be the case for hedge funds that invest in the small-cap equity space. 
Track Record: If an investor wants a fund to have a minimum track record of 24 or 36 months, this guideline will eliminate any new funds. However, sometimes a fund manager will leave to start their own fund and although the fund is new, the manager's performance can be tracked for a much longer time period. 
Minimum Investment: This criterion is very important for smaller investors as many funds have minimums that can make it difficult to diversify properly. The fund's minimum investment can also give an indication of the types of investors in the fund. Larger minimums may indicate a higher proportion of institutional investors, while low minimums may indicate of a larger number of individual investors.
Redemption Terms: These terms have implications for liquidity and become very important when an overall portfolio is highly illiquid. Longer lock-up periods are more difficult to incorporate into a portfolio, and redemption periods longer than a month can present some challenges during the portfolio-management process. A guideline may be implemented to eliminate funds that have lockups when a portfolio is already illiquid, while this guideline may be relaxed when a portfolio has adequate liquidity.
How Are Hedge Fund Profits Taxed?
When a domestic U.S. hedge fund returns profits to its investors, the money is subject to capital gains tax. The short-term capital gains rate applies to profits on investments held for less than one year, and it is the same as the investor's tax rate on ordinary income. For investments held for more than one year, the rate is not more than 15% for most taxpayers, but it can go as high as 20% in high tax brackets. This tax applies to both U.S. and foreign investors.
An offshore hedge fund is established outside of the United States, usually in a low-tax or tax-free country. It accepts investments from foreign investors and tax-exempt U.S. entities. These investors do not incur any U.S. tax liability on the distributed profits.
Ways Hedge Funds Avoid Paying Taxes
Many hedge funds are structured to take advantage of carried interest. Under this structure, a fund is treated as a partnership. The founders and fund managers are the general partners, while the investors are the limited partners. The founders also own the management company that runs the hedge fund. The managers earn the 20% performance fee of the carried interest as the general partner of the fund.
Hedge fund managers are compensated with this carried interest; their income from the fund is taxed as a return on investments as opposed to a salary or compensation for services rendered. The incentive fee is taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 20% as opposed to ordinary income tax rates, where the top rate is 39.6%. This represents significant tax savings for hedge fund managers.
This business arrangement has its critics, who say that the structure is a loophole that allows hedge funds to avoid paying taxes. The carried interest rule has not yet been overturned despite multiple attempts in Congress. It became a topical issue during the 2016 primary election.
Many prominent hedge funds use reinsurance businesses in Bermuda as another way to reduce their tax liabilities. Bermuda does not charge a corporate income tax, so hedge funds set up their own reinsurance companies in Bermuda. The hedge funds then send money to the reinsurance companies in Bermuda. These reinsurers, in turn, invest those funds back into the hedge funds. Any profits from the hedge funds go to the reinsurers in Bermuda, where they owe no corporate income tax. The profits from the hedge fund investments grow without any tax liability. Taxes are only owed once the investors sell their stakes in the reinsurers.
The business in Bermuda must be an insurance business. Any other type of business would likely incur penalties from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for passive foreign investment companies. The IRS defines insurance as an active business. To qualify as an active business, the reinsurance company cannot have a pool of capital that is much larger than what it needs to back the insurance that it sells. It is unclear what this standard is, as it has not yet been defined by the IRS.
Hedge Fund Controversies 
A number of hedge funds have been implicated in insider trading scandals since 2008. The two most high-profile insider trading cases involve the Galleon Group managed by Raj Rajaratnam and SAC Capital managed by Steven Cohen.
The Galleon Group managed over $7 billion at its peak before being forced to close in 2009. The firm was founded in 1997 by Raj Rajaratnam. In 2009, federal prosecutors charged Rajaratnam with multiple counts of fraud and insider trading. He was convicted on 14 charges in 2011 and began serving an 11-year sentence. Many Galleon Group employees were also convicted in the scandal.
Rajaratnam was caught obtaining insider information from Rajat Gupta, a board member of Goldman Sachs. Before the news was made public, Gupta allegedly passed on information that Warren Buffett was making an investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Rajaratnam was able to buy substantial amounts of Goldman Sachs stock and make a hefty profit on those shares in one day.
Rajaratnam was also convicted on other insider trading charges. Throughout his tenure as a fund manager, he cultivated a group of industry insiders to gain access to material information.
Steven Cohen and his hedge fund, SAC Capital, were also implicated in a messy insider trading scandal. SAC Capital managed around $50 billion at its peak. The SEC raided offices of four investment companies run by former SAC Capital traders in 2010. Over the next few years, the SEC filed a number of criminal charges against former SAC Capital traders.
Mathew Martoma, a former SAC Capital portfolio manager, was convicted on insider trading charges that allegedly led to over $276 million in profits for SAC. He obtained insider information on FDA clinical drug trials on an Alzheimer’s drug that SAC Capital then traded.
Steven Cohen individually never faced criminal charges. Rather, the SEC filed a civil suit against SAC Capital for failing to properly supervise its traders. The Department of Justice filed a criminal indictment against the hedge fund for securities fraud and wire fraud. SAC Capital agreed to settle all claims against it by pleading guilty and paying a $1.2 billion fine. The hedge fund further agreed to stop managing outside money. However, a settlement in January 2016 overturned Cohen’s lifetime ban from managing money and will let him manage money in two years, subject to review by an independent consultant and SEC exams.
New Regulations for Hedge Funds
Hedge funds are so big and powerful that the SEC is starting to pay closer attention, particularly because breaches such as insider trading and fraud seem to be occurring much more frequently. However, a recent act has actually loosened the way that hedge funds can market their vehicles to investors. 
In March 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was signed into law. The basic premise of the JOBS Act was to encourage funding of small businesses in the U.S. by easing securities regulation. The JOBS Act also had a major impact on hedge funds: In September 2013, the ban on hedge fund advertising was lifted. In a 4-to-1 vote, the SEC approved a motion to allow hedge funds and other firms that create private offerings to advertise to whomever they want, but they still can only accept investments from accredited investors. Hedge funds are often key suppliers of capital to startups and small businesses because of their wide investment latitude. Giving hedge funds the opportunity to solicit capital would in effect help the growth of small businesses by increasing the pool of available investment capital.
Hedge fund advertising entails offering the fund's investment products to accredited investors or financial intermediaries through print, television and the internet. A hedge fund that wants to solicit (advertise to) investors must file a “Form D” with the SEC at least 15 days before it starts advertising. Because hedge fund advertising was strictly prohibited prior to lifting this ban, the SEC is very interested in how advertising is being used by private issuers, so it has made changes to Form D filings. Funds that make public solicitations will also need to file an amended Form D within 30 days of the offering’s termination. Failure to follow these rules will likely result in a ban from creating additional securities for a year or more.

                    FATCA Compliance for Investment Fund Managers, Part Three
                

                    June 26, 2013
                


                    Offshore Master with U.S. and Offshore Feeders
                




This is the third in a series of Foley Advisers about FATCA, the new U.S. tax regime designed to combat offshore tax evasion by U.S. taxpayers that will go into effect on January 1, 2014.  Our prior installments described FATCA compliance for (1) U.S. stand-alone funds and U.S. feeder funds with only U.S. investors (Part One click here), and (2) U.S. master funds with offshore feeder funds that are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes (Part Two click here).  This Part Three focuses on preliminary FATCA compliance for offshore master funds with onshore and offshore feeder funds – for example, a Cayman Islands master (treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes) with a Delaware limited partnership feeder and a Cayman Islands feeder (treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes).  The following discussion assumes that the offshore master fund is required to be FATCA-compliant.1 
Offshore Funds:  Master and Feeder
The specific FATCA compliance obligations of an offshore master fund or an offshore feeder fund will depend on the country in which such offshore fund is organized.  The United States currently is in the process of concluding FATCA-related Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) with countries throughout the world, based on two model agreements:  the Model 1 IGA and the Model 2 IGA.2   An offshore fund organized in a Model 1 jurisdiction will refer to the applicable Model 1 IGA and local law to determine its FATCA compliance requirements.  In contrast, an offshore fund organized in either a Model 2 jurisdiction or in a country that is not a party to an IGA generally will refer to the U.S. FATCA regulations to determine its FATCA compliance requirements.
Regardless of whether your offshore fund is located in a country that is a Model 1, Model 2 or non-IGA jurisdiction, you must take the following preliminary steps:

Registration:  You must register each offshore fund entity with the IRS using the online “FATCA Registration Portal,” which will be accessible through the IRS’s website no later than July 15, 2013.3   Upon successful registration, each of the offshore funds will receive a Global Intermediary Identification Number (“GIIN”), a special taxpayer identification number for FATCA purposes, and its name and GIIN will be included in an online list of FATCA-compliant entities that will be first published in December 2013 and then will be updated on a monthly basis.4
FATCA Agreement:  As part of the registration process, an offshore fund that is organized in a Model 2 or non-IGA jurisdiction will be required to enter into an agreement with the IRS, pursuant to which the offshore fund will agree to undertake certain due diligence obligations with respect to its current and future owners, submit information returns to the IRS with respect to certain U.S. owners, and conduct withholding on payments or allocations of certain U.S.-source income to non-U.S. entity owners that fail to comply with FATCA.5
IRS Form W-9:  The offshore master fund must maintain a valid IRS Form W-9 for its U.S. feeder fund in its files.
IRS Form W-8:  Once the offshore funds have registered and obtained their GIINs, each offshore fund should immediately complete a new, “post-FATCA” IRS Form W-8.6

The offshore master fund should maintain a valid “post-FATCA” IRS Form W-8 for the offshore feeder fund in its files and verify, on an ongoing basis, that the offshore feeder fund and its GIIN continue to be included in the published IRS list of   FATCA-compliant entities.
In addition, the offshore master fund should prepare its own valid “post-FATCA” IRS Form W-8 and furnish it to entities in which it invests, if required.



If the offshore master fund invests in another entity that is a “withholding agent” for FATCA purposes (such as an unrelated U.S. investment fund, or an unrelated non-U.S. investment fund that is subject to FATCA, in a fund-of-funds structure), and such investment was or is made prior to January 1, 2014, you generally will have a grace period until June 30, 2014 to provide the offshore master fund’s “post-FATCA” IRS Form W-8 and GIIN to the withholding agent in order to avoid the FATCA withholding tax.7   In contrast, if the offshore master fund makes an initial investment in an entity that is a withholding agent on or after January 1, 2014, you generally will have 90 days from the date on which the offshore master fund acquires the interest to provide this information to the withholding agent.8 
Regardless of the applicable deadlines, you should begin the FATCA registration process (1) with respect to existing offshore funds, as soon as possible after registration opens in July 2013, and (2) with respect to offshore funds formed after the FATCA Registration Portal becomes accessible, as soon as possible thereafter.
Onshore Feeder Fund
In order to ensure that the onshore feeder fund is FATCA-compliant, you should follow the procedures in Part One (click here) if the onshore feeder fund has only U.S. investors, or the procedures in Part Two (click here) if the onshore feeder fund has U.S. and non-U.S. investors.  In either case, the onshore feeder fund should provide the offshore master fund with a valid IRS Form W-9, if it has not done so already.

The foregoing discussion is limited to the preliminary FATCA compliance obligations of offshore master-feeder structures.  Offshore entities that must be FATCA-compliant will have additional ongoing obligations to maintain their compliance with FATCA.  You should review your fund and subscription documents to ensure that they contain appropriate provisions to enable the offshore master fund and its onshore and offshore feeder funds to fulfill their additional FATCA compliance obligations, including provisions requiring investors to provide any needed information under FATCA. 
FATCA compliance is case-specific.  If you would like more detailed information regarding FATCA, please contact Kip Cawley, Rick Schaul-Yoder, Nicola Lemay, or your Foley Hoag lawyer.

1. Not all foreign entities must be FATCA-compliant. Many factors, including source and type of income, affiliations with other foreign entities and business relationships may affect the determination of whether a foreign entity must be FATCA-compliant. An analysis of these factors and a discussion of this determination are outside the scope of this Foley Adviser.↩
2. Most countries in which offshore funds typically are organized, including the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, have executed or currently are negotiating Model 1 IGAs.↩
3. We will publish another Foley Adviser regarding access to the Portal after the IRS makes the information available.↩
4. Even if an offshore fund completes the registration process in July 2013, the IRS will not begin issuing GIINs until October 2013.↩
5. An offshore fund organized in a Model 1 jurisdiction will not be required to enter into a FATCA agreement, but will have similar responsibilities under the applicable Model 1 IGA and local law, including the obligation to collect information about its owners and furnish information to its local taxing authority with respect to certain U.S. owners, which information then will be shared with the IRS.↩
6. Existing versions of IRS Form W-8 are not sufficient; the IRS intends to issue new versions of Form W-8 specifically for FATCA purposes. We will publish another Foley Adviser with links to these “post-FATCA” Forms W-8 after the IRS makes the final versions of such forms available.↩
7. The applicable grace period for offshore funds with pre-2014 investments in non-U.S. entities organized in IGA jurisdictions may vary depending upon the terms of the applicable IGA.↩
8. These deadlines also apply to offshore feeder funds and are based on the date an offshore feeder fund acquires its interest in an offshore master fund.↩

Mauritius: Investment Funds In Mauritius
Last Updated: 23 January 2008
Article by Ludovic Charles VerbistAAMIL Global Financial Services
 1. Corporate and Legal Structure
An investment fund in Mauritius
    is commonly structured as a public company registered under the
    provision of the Companies Act 2001 and licensed as a Category
    1 Global Business Licence company under the Financial Services
    Act 2007. The investment business of the company is regulated
    under the Securities Act 2005 (as amended in 2007) and by the
    "best industry practices" rules set out by the
    Financial Services Commission (FSC).
Such a structure, referred to as
    an investment company, is defined as one where the
    company's business consists of investing its funds mainly
    in securities with the aim of spreading investment risks and
    giving members of the company the benefit of the results of the
    management of its funds.
An investment company can take
    the form of:

A close-ended company which has a fixed share capital.
      Investors do not have the right to call for their shares to
      be redeemed at net asset value by the company. A close-ended
      company can be listed on the stock exchange, thus enabling
      investors to buy and sell shares on the public market and
      thereby preventing any lock in.

Such a company may be formed
        with a limited life after which the assets are distributed
        to investors upon winding up.

An open-ended company which has a variable share capital.
      Investors are allowed to redeem their shares at net asset
      value at pre-determined times in accordance with the
      Constitution (M&A) of the company.
A private equity fund which invests in shares or stakes
      of private companies. It is not allowed to invest in public
      companies or securities.
A mutual fund which invests in units of funds which is
      already investing in portfolio companies.

It is also possible to
    constitute the foregoing structures as multi-class or umbrella
    funds. The umbrella fund will comprise of two or more sub funds
    and investors subscribe for shares or units in specific sub
    funds, each of which has its own investment policy with
    segregated assets and accounting records.
Investors can switch their
    investments from one sub fund to another without redeeming
    their shares or units. An investment company in Mauritius can
    also be set up as one of the sub funds of an umbrella fund
    established outside Mauritius.
The share capital of the
    investment company is represented by registered shares,
    although share warrants may also be issued. The shares should
    have a par value and no bearer shares or debentures are
    allowed.
2. Registration Requirements
In order to operate as an
    investment company in Mauritius, prior approval of the FSC must
    be sought. In considering an application, the FSC needs to be
    satisfied of the following:

the track record and credentials of the promoters;
the fund's structure and objectives;
the investors and the market targeted;
the types of investments the fund will be dealing
      in;
the track record of the investment manager, independent
      custodian and administrator; and
proof of compliance with regulations in third countries,
      as appropriate (e.g. the Stock Exchange Board of India's
      approval, if investment is to be made in India).

Once the FSC is satisfied with
    the above, it may give an approval in principle so as to enable
    all constitutive documents to be prepared and the company to be
    incorporated.
The FSC generally wishes to
    satisfy itself that, as far as possible, substance and central
    administration are in Mauritius. To this end, the investment
    company must have a local administrator, a local independent
    custodian and a local auditor.
The requirement that central
    administration is situated in Mauritius implies that:

the accounts are kept and the accounting documents are
      available in Mauritius;
the principal office of the investment company is
      situated in Mauritius;
issues and redemptions of shares are carried out in
      Mauritius; and
the calculation of the Net Asset Value (NAV) is carried
      out in Mauritius.

The above does not exclude the
    possibility of the investment company obtaining assistance for
    the management of its assets from an investment adviser
    established overseas, nor does it prevent management decisions
    in relation to investments and disinvestments being executed
    overseas. Also, the requirement for the location of the
    issuance and redemption of shares to be in Mauritius does not
    preclude foreign intermediaries from participating in the
    placing and redemption operations, as distributors or
    nominees.
In appropriate circumstances, it
    is also possible to establish a management or advisory company
    in Mauritius in order to take advantage of the beneficial tax
    regime.
3. Taxation
An investment company registered
    in Mauritius is liable to taxation on its income at the rate of
    15%. The laws of Mauritius allow an underlying foreign tax
    credit, equal to the amount of foreign taxes paid, up to the
    amount of tax due in Mauritius.
In the absence of proof, the
    amount of foreign tax paid is presumed to be 80% of the
    Mauritius tax. The effective tax rate can thereby be reduced to
    a maximum of 3%.
Investment funds which are
    centrally controlled and managed in Mauritius can, with the
    approval of the Director General of the Mauritius Revenue
    Authority, accede to the benefits of Double Taxation
    Agreements. Furthermore it should be noted that there is no
    withholding tax on dividends, capital gains and interests.
4. Custodian
All investment funds must
    entrust the custody of their assets to an approved local
    independent custodian – generally, a banking
    institution. The custodian carries out operations concerning
    the day-to-day administration of the assets of the investment
    fund and is responsible for ensuring that the sale, issue,
    redemption, and cancellation of shares are done in accordance
    with the investment management regulations of the investment
    company.
The custodian can delegate some
    of its activities to an approved third party, but remains
    principally liable.
5. Reports
Investment funds are required to
    file with FSC an audited annual report in accordance with the
    International Financial Reporting Standards (or other
    applicable standards). These reports must include, at least,
    the following:

a statement of assets and liabilities, including the
      NAV;
the number of shares outstanding;
the NAV per share; and
details of the investment portfolio and the movements in
      the period, disclosed by types of securities and type of
      market analyzed as a percentage of the investment fund's
      net assets.

6. Supervision
The FSC can request other
    information in addition to the published reports and reporting
    requirements. It also has the right to inspect or to cause
    inspection of the books and records of the investment fund.
7. Listing
Investment funds can be listed
    on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius Ltd.
8. Fees payable for the Listing of Investment
    Funds
In the case of a
    "multi-class fund" or an "umbrella fund",
    the following will apply in respect of the initial and annual
    listing fees payable:



No. of different
          classes


Initial Fee /
          Annual Fee (Rs)

          sub-fund)




4-10


US$ 5,000 (fixed)




10-20


US$ 7,500 (fixed)




Over 20


US$ 10,000



9. Incorporation Procedures
The application for the
    incorporation of an investment fund as a Global Business
    Licence (Category 1) company must be made through AAMIL
    Ltd.
The main documents that are
    required for such are as follows:

Constitution (2 copies);
Consent forms of directors, shareholders and the
      secretary;
Letters of reference from the bankers of the directors,
      promoters and authorised signatories;
Legal certificate from local law practitioner;
Set of constitutive documents of the fund,
      including:



Prospectus
Custodian Agreements
Sub-custodian Agreements (if any)
Investment Management Agreements
Administration Agreements

10. Prospectus or Private Placement
    Memorandum
Investment funds in Mauritius
    must lodge a prospectus (or a private placement memorandum)
    with the FSC. The draft or highlights of the main clauses of
    the private placement memorandum or any offer document should
    contain relevant details, including, but not limited to the
    following:

General information regarding the fund, namely its
      objectives, size of the fund and minimum subscription;
Investment objective/policy/ restrictions;
Investment process (if known at that stage);
Target sector(s) of investment and investment
      instruments;
Country/region of investments;
Exit strategies for investors;
Details of risks involved in the scheme (if known at that
      stage);
An indication of the profile and location of the
      investors;
Capital structure, classes of shares, rights and
      obligations attached to each class of shares and indication
      of the holder(s) of each class of shares;
Compliance requirements of other regulatory bodies (if
      any);
Track records, duties and obligations of the investment
      managers, advisors, custodians, administrators, etc.);
      and
Details on the core investment management team.

In addition to the prospectus of
    the fund, the usual due diligence documents on the promoter(s)
    of the fund should also be submitted.

published on this server for any purpose. All such documents and related 
graphics are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Mondaq Ltd and/or

regard to this information, including all implied warranties and conditions of 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. 
In no event shall Mondaq Ltd and/or its respective suppliers be liable for any

or other tortious action, arising out of or in connection with the use or 
performance of information available from this server.

Registration
Mondaq Ltd requires you to register and provide information that personally 
identifies you, including what sort of information you are interested in, for 
three primary purposes: 

To allow you to personalize the Mondaq websites you are visiting. 
  To enable features such as password reminder, newsletter alerts, email a 
  colleague, and linking from Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to your website. 
  To produce demographic feedback for our information providers who provide 
  information free for your use. 
Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) do not sell or provide your details to third 
parties other than information providers. The reason we provide our information 
providers with this information is so that they can measure the response their 
articles are receiving and provide you with information about their products and 
services.
If you do not want us to provide your name and email address you may opt out 
by clicking here .
If you do not wish to receive any future announcements of products and 
services offered by Mondaq by clicking here . 
Information Collection and Use
We require site users to register with Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to 
view the free information on the site. We also collect information from our 
users at several different points on the websites: this is so that we can 
customise the sites according to individual usage, provide 'session-aware' 
functionality, and ensure that content is acquired and developed appropriately. 
This gives us an overall picture of our user profiles, which in turn shows to 
our Editorial Contributors the type of person they are reaching by posting 
articles on Mondaq (and its affiliate sites)  meaning more free content for 
registered users. 
We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate 
sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the 
pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us 
(e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who 
author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the 
Your Profile page. We and our author organisations may only contact you via 
email or other means if you allow us to do so. Users can opt out of contact when 
they register on the site, or send an email to unsubscribe@mondaq.com with no 
disclosure in the subject heading 
Mondaq News Alerts
In order to receive Mondaq News Alerts, users have to complete a separate 
registration form. This is a personalised service where users choose regions and 
topics of interest and we send it only to those users who have requested it. 
Users can stop receiving these Alerts by going to the Mondaq News Alerts page 
and deselecting all interest areas. In the same way users can amend their 
personal preferences to add or remove subject areas. 
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a users hard drive that contains an 
identifying user number. The cookies do not contain any personal information 
about users. We use the cookie so users do not have to log in every time they 
use the service and the cookie will automatically expire if you do not visit the 
Mondaq website (or its affiliate sites) for 12 months. We also use the cookie to 
personalise a user's experience of the site (for example to show information 
specific to a user's region). As the Mondaq sites are fully personalised and 
cookies are essential to its core technology the site will function 
unpredictably with browsers that do not support cookies - or where cookies are 
disabled (in these circumstances we advise you to attempt to locate the 
information you require elsewhere on the web). However if you are concerned 
about the presence of a Mondaq cookie on your machine you can also choose to 
expire the cookie immediately (remove it) by selecting the 'Log Off' menu option 
as the last thing you do when you use the site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and we 
are not aware of any at present that do so. 
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track movement, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to personally identifiable information. 
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Mondaq (or 
its affiliate sites) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information 
requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
functionality of the site. 
Mail-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friends name and email address. Mondaq stores this 
information and may contact the friend to invite them to register with Mondaq, 
but they will not be contacted more than once. The friend may contact Mondaq to 
request the removal of this information from our database. 
Security
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected using firewalls and other security technology. If you 
have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
webmaster@mondaq.com. 
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If a users personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that users personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the Your Profile page or by sending an email to EditorialAdvisor@mondaq.com.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, we will 
post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information 
we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
How to contact Mondaq
You can contact us with comments or queries at enquiries@mondaq.com.
If for some reason you believe Mondaq Ltd. has not adhered to these 
principles, please notify us by e-mail at problems@mondaq.com and we will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly.
