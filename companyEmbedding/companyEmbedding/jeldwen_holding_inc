JELD-WEN Holding, inc. Key Developments

JELD-WEN Holding, inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Full Year 2017
May 9 17
JELD-WEN Holding, inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net revenues increased $51.2 million, or 6.4%, to $847.8 million, compared to $796.5 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by core growth of 6%, as well as the contribution of recent acquisitions in the Australasia segment.
Net income increased $0.4 million, or 6.3%, to $6.4 million, compared to $6.0 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $19.8 million, or 32.4%, to $81.0 million, compared to $61.2 million in the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operations improved $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $8.2 million, from $28.2 million in the same period last year.


For full year 2017, compared to full year 2016, the company continues to expect an increase in net revenues of 1.5% to 3.5%. The increase in net revenues is expected to be driven by core growth and a small incremental carryover from 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The company has raised its expectation for 2017 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $440 million to $460 million, from its prior expectation of $435 million to $455 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $394.1 million for 2016. Capital expenditures are still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.

History[edit]




Jeld-Wen predecessor company Morgan Manufacturing, Oskosh, Wisconsin. The Morgan Manufacturing plant was shut down in 2009.[5]


The company was founded in 1960 in the Southern Oregon town of Klamath Falls when Richard Wendt and four others purchased a mill.[6] In 2010, Wendt died and the company sold off many resorts that it had developed in the Western United States.[6] The privately held company sold off 58 percent of the company to Onex in a deal worth $864 million.[6]
The name JELD-WEN had already been in use for a number of years by the Wendt family; in the 1930s Lester Wendt bought a small farm outside of Dubuque, Iowa, as a family retreat. After holding a family contest to name the farm, Dick’s cousin Jeanette Coughlin thought of the name JELD-WEN, an acronym for the names of Dick’s immediate family, and a shortened version of Wendt.[7]
Subsidiaries[edit]
In 1993 JELD-WEN entered the European Market and has now subsidiaries in 12 European countries.[8] Europe is divided in four groups - North Europe, Central Europe, France, and the UK.[9] Eauze is the headquarters in France, where JELD-WEN bought the company France Portes in 1998.[10] JELD-WEN's UK subsidiary was 1999 formed by the purchase of two British joinery companies from the Rugby Group plc: Boulton & Paul Ltd and John Carr Ltd.[8] It also purchased part of the Magnet Group and door manufacturing sites at Penrith and Sheffield. Oettingen is the Jeld-Wen headquarters from Germany.
JELD-WEN Australia has several subsidiaries, including Stegbar, Regency, William Russell, Corinthian Doors, Airlite, Aneeta, Breezway and Trend Windows & Doors.
JELD-WEN has had a strong presence in Canada since 1996, when it acquired Willmar Windows. It has 7 sales centres located throughout the country, with its corporate offices in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Jeld-Wen of Canada's divisions include Willmar, United, Donat Flamand, and Millwork Distribution.
Sponsorships[edit]
JELD-WEN is the main sponsor of the St Kilda Football Club in the Australian Football League. The three-year sponsorship deal started in the 2008 season.[11]
The company sponsored the Stone Brothers Racing Team in the Australian V8 Supercar series, in particular the number 4 car driven by James Courtney.[12] They sponsored this car from 2006 to 2008, when James left the team. They are still a personal sponsor of James to this day. They sponsor Marcos Ambrose who is currently driving in the US NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.[13] James Courtney ironically was Marcos Ambrose replacement at Stone Brothers Racing in 2006. In January 2013, Jeld-Wen re-entered V8 Supercars as naming rights sponsor of the Charlie Schwerkolt Racing Number 18 Ford Falcon driven by Alex Davison as part of the expanded four car Ford Performance Racing squad.[14]
In March 2011, JELD-WEN was announced as the stadium name sponsor in Portland, Oregon of Jeld-Wen Field that homes the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer and the Portland State Vikings college football team.[15]
In Canada, JELD-WEN sponsors several National Hockey League teams, minor hockey clubs, and major hockey tournaments.[16]

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
