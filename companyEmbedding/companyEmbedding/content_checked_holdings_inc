(CNCK) is the parent company of a family of mobile applications for individuals with specific dietary requirements, currently focusing upon food allergies and intolerances. More than 15 million people in the United States suffer from food allergies, and the number is far greater when you add in all those who develop stomach problems as a result of different foods. In fact, the market for food allergies and intolerances has been valued at $13 billion in 2015.CNCK has also launched two other apps: MigraineChecked and SugarChecked. The company’s extended reach, via this new family of apps, is truly staggering when you look at facts like: 38 million people in the United States are currently diagnosed with migraines; and more than 17 million people are at risk of developing, or have already developed, Type 2 Diabetes (a diet and lifestyle-based disease), the largest health related cost in the country. Additionally, in the near future, ContentChecked will be available in Canada, Sweden, England and Germany.Consumers register their food allergies or intolerances with one of the apps, and simply scan the bar codes of whichever items they are considering purchasing.  The app then provides users with information on what products fit their pre-set requirements.  This connection between food producers and users is the basis of the ContentChecked business model – a highly engaged consumer, ready to buy, and in need of recommendations.ContentChecked was released in Beta Phase in July of 2014.  Since, the company has continued to build the database based on product information from food producers and now currently incorporates 70% of all conventional US products. The system also enables users to add unlisted products, which in turn helps grow the product base and community.

MigraineChecked — ContentChecked
























































 







FIND RELIEF TODAYMigraineChecked is a mobile application for migraine sufferers who want to avoid eating foods that may trigger a migraine. By scanning the product's barcode with the app, the user will find out if the product contains an ingredient, additive or certain chemical compound that has shown to trigger migraines. It will also highlight the specific compound in the ingredient list which triggered the warning.  












































 

 





























 MIGRAINE FACTSMigraine is considered a medical illness, one that is very different from a headache. A migraine is usually a combination of multiple neural symptoms, including head pain, nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light. Migraines may also continue for multiple days at a time. More than 36 million Americans are affected by migraine, which is more than 10% of the total population. That results in an average of $20 billion annually.Migraines come in two different primary forms; migraines with aura and those without aura. Migraine aura is when the headache pain is accompanied by other sensory discomfort such as sensitivity to light, sound, touch, and smell. One may experience an “aura-only” migraine, a migraine with debilitating head pain, or both. As one of the twenty-most debilitating medical illness in the United States, migraine has a large affect on the economy as well, costing employers more than $13 billion per year due to lost work days. There is not a generic list of symptoms that comes with migraines, as many are specific to the individual. These range from extreme pain, nausea, sensitivity to light & sound and many more. Along the same lines, there are numerous triggers that cause migraines including environmental factors, lifestyle and food. However, migraine triggers are unique to the individual and are not the cause of the migraine. Rather, migraine triggers are the precursor to the constricting of blood vessels and other physiological changes that cause migraine. TYPES OF MIGRAINES 







CLASSIC MIGRAINEA classic migraine creates pain, nausea and vision problemswhich spread throughout one hemisphere of the head. 







NECK MIGRAINEDespite its name, pain can occur at the base of thehead (neck) and/or at the very top of the head. 







SINUS MIGRAINEA sinus migraine may result from a sinus infectionand is apparent behind the browbone and cheekbones.







CLUSTER MIGRAINEThe pain from a cluster headache is centralizedaround the eye and tends to cause eye soreness.  COMMON FOOD TRIGGERSFood triggers are very subjective for every individual. Below is a list of 10 of the most common food triggers: Tyramine or PhenylethylamoneFoods rich in these include chocolate, olives, avocado, red plums, bananas, citrus fruits, processed meats, alcohol and aged cheeses. Yeast BreadsCoumarin is a naturally occurring chemical found in yeast that causes this. Some foods to watch out for soft pretzels and pizza crust. NitritesThe nitric oxide that is produced from these foods is the cause of this trigger. Some foods include hot dogs, sausages, ham, bacon, beets, celery, lettuce, radishes and spinach. TanninsCommonly found in beans such as navy beans, kidney beans and lima beans. SulfitesDried fruits are one of the most common foods that contain this trigger. AdditivesAdditives can be hidden under many names. One of the most common is MSG. AspartameTry using a natural sweetener substitute like stevia, instead. CaffeineThis one can be a little tricky. For some, it is a trigger. Yet, if combined with pain relieving medications, can also help speed up the amount of time it takes the body to absorb these.    Chili PeppersThe culprit for this is capsaicin!   For more information visit the Mayo Clinic and the American Migraine Foundation.Migraine blog

ContentChecked, A family of mobile applications for individuals with specific dietary requirements and preferences.


West Hollywood, Calif. (PRWEB)
April 30, 2015
 Content Checked Holdings, Inc. (formerly Vesta International, Corp.) (OTCQB: CNCK), a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), announced today that it completed a reverse merger on Friday, April 17, 2015, in which Content Checked, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“ContentChecked”), became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and completed a simultaneous $1.9 million private placement offering. Shares of the Company's common stock are currently quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol “CNCK.”
Content Checked is creating a revolutionary marketplace for people with dietary restrictions and organizations who cater for them. Content Checked has created and introduced to the market smartphone applications designed for use by those who suffer from food allergies & intolerances, and migraine & chronic headaches. In the U.S. alone 15 million people suffer from Food Allergies and 38 Million from Migraine and Chronic Headaches. The Food Allergy market has an estimated value of $6 billion USD. The applications allow its users to have the ability to scan product’s bar code and determine if it is safe for consumption, and if not, what is the better alternative for their specific dietary profile. Their friends and family can also use it to assist in their food selections.  Content Checked’s management believes it has created the first applications with genuine comprehensive content information and in-depth allergen and migraine definitions for most U.S. food products and is designed to meet the needs for millions of people in the United States. Moreover, it has created a revolutionary way for food producers to find consumers that actively ask for their products at the point of purchase. Content Checked has unique database of allergens, migraine triggers, and food ingredients that directly correlate with food allergies & intolerances and/or migraine & chronic headaches. Currently there are several hundreds of thousand products in the database and it is constantly growing. The applications are highly scalable and can expand into new geographic areas and product categories with limited modifications and investment. 
The ContentChecked smartphone application helps users to personalize their shopping lists and makes sure they purchase products that are compatible with their specific allergies and intolerances. The ContentChecked application and supporting database allows its user to save time and make better decisions while grocery shopping since the application will guide and direct shopping based upon the user’s dietary needs.
The MigraineChecked smartphone application is based upon the publically available research from the University of Berkley California. The application helps migraine sufferers, and those who care for them, to save time and make better decisions while grocery shopping since the application will guide and direct shopping based upon the user’s dietary needs.
“Born from a father's confusion and frustration about what to feed his daughter and her friends with specific food allergies, ContentChecked was founded to design and develop solutions that will positively impact individuals’ health. Indeed, ContentChecked is both useful, but, also necessary due to insufficient labeling laws in the U.S. and ‘shifting’ manufacturing practices.  Moreover, we see ContentChecked as being a critical tool to newly diagnosed food allergy families just learning to read labels and finding safe foods,” remarked Kris Finstad, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “This financing will enable us to expand our technology and marketing even further and drive adoption in the healthcare market.”
Concurrent with the completion of the reverse merger, the Company completed a private placement offering (“PPO”) of 4,299,400 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $1,920,150 (including the conversion of previously issued unsecured Bridge Notes and secured Bridge Note and before deducting expenses of the offering estimated at approximately $125,000). After giving effect to the closing of the reverse merger and the PPO, there are approximately 34,622,602 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding.  In addition, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders have approved, a 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of incentive awards of up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to officers, key employees, consultants and directors.
Effective with the completion of the reverse merger, the sole member of the Board of Directors of the Company was Kris Finstad; however, two additional members of the Board, including one independent director, are anticipated to be appointed in the coming days.
The Company intends to use net proceeds of the offering principally to expand its sales and marketing efforts, to sustain its research and development efforts, and for working capital.
The Company intends to file an amendment to its Current Report on Form 8-K as soon as possible to include Content Checked’s required financial statements. In accordance with “reverse merger” accounting treatment, the Company's historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Content Checked Holdings Inc. in future filings with the SEC.
The securities issued in the merger and sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be resold absent registration under, or exemption from registration under, the Securities Act.

 Content Checked Holdings Inc. (CNCK) is the parent company of a family of mobile applications designed for individuals with specific dietary preferences and requirements. Since the official U.S. launch of its namesake app in early 2015, ContentChecked has continued to build its database of product information. Information is obtained from food manufacturers and internal proprietary research. The database now incorporates 70% of all conventional U.S. products, fully supporting the needs of ContentChecked customers. Consumers register their food allergies or intolerances with ContentChecked, and simply scan the bar codes of whichever items they are considering purchasing. The app then provides users with information on what products fit their pre-set requirements. This connection between food producers and users is the basis of the CNCK business model – a highly engaged consumer, ready to buy, and in need of recommendations. By initially focusing upon food allergies and intolerances, ContentChecked had access to a marketplace of more than 15 million people in the United States that suffer from food allergies in addition to a demographic with specific preferences or who develop digestive problems as a result of different foods. Though the overall market for food allergies and intolerances is valued at $13 billion in 2015, CNCK further expanded its market reach through the launch of MigraineChecked, SugarChecked and VeganChecked applications. With these offerings, Content Checked's market reach now extends to the roughly 38 million people in the United States currently diagnosed with migraines; as well as to the largest health-related cost in the country: the 97 million people at risk of developing, or have already developed, Type 2 diabetes. CNCK growth is spearheaded by a talented team of professionals using their experience in entrepreneurial endeavors, sales, marketing and advisory services, nutrition, web design, social media and graphics and data management to help users better manage their food allergies, migraines and overall health.     Content Checked Holdings        ContentChecked       MigraineChecked      SugarChecked           Investment Highlights  Targeting $13B Food Allergy & Intolerance Market 	Growing Suite of Apps Based on Proprietary Technology 	Dynamic Real-Time Database of Consumable Products 	Available in iOS & Android Versions in U.S. & Norway 	200+ Food Producers Signed to ContentChecked 	Pending Contracts with Larger U.S. Food Producers 	Overwhelming Support from Industry Organizations     App Overview  Content Checked apps offer a unique mobile experience that analyzes more than 70% of all food products in the United States to check if they fit the specific dietary needs of the user. The process is based upon more than algorithms – it utilizes a dedicated team of nutritional experts that validate data against the most up-to-date research to ensure quality. This process is done 24/7 and is constantly undergoing review so that the app can provide as accurate information as possible with each use.  Here's How it Works  Grocery shopping can be time-consuming, especially for individuals and family members of persons with specific dietary restrictions. Content Checked's suite of mobile applications apps save precious time and avoid unnecessary stress while grocery shopping, enabling friends and family enjoy peace of mind while shopping and preparing foods for persons with dietary restrictions. From migraines to food allergies, Content Checked apps can help the more than 28% of Americans with an allergy or intolerance to various ingredients, as well as the more than 38 million Americans suffering from migraines. With Content Checked's technology, persons with dietary restriction and allergies always have the power shop confidently for themselves and others. Content Checked apps also utilize a comprehensive menu and recipe database to provide tips and ideas on how to prepare specific foods for those who need have restrictions. The apps allow users to set up profiles and lists of favorites for themselves, friends and family, making sharing favorites and ideas safe, fun, simple and easy. The apps also allow food manufacturers to showcase their products in an effective and relevant way, providing them with a platform to communicate to those suffering with dietary restrictions on a variety of alternatives that are better suited to their needs. As such, both manufacturers and consumers benefit from targeted communication.  Consumer Solution   Helps people with food allergies, intolerances and dietary restrictions to select safe and alternative products 	 Equally important for relatives, friends, co-workers, parents and teachers     	Allows a user to scan the UPC on food packaging that references a dynamic database detailing any allergens based on user parameters   Excellent communication/marketing tool 	 Improve efficiency and reduce market expenses significantly for the food industry     Streams movies related to products, recipes and menus within the app     Suite of Apps & Market Relevance   Content Checked's suite of smart phone apps are designed for people with food allergies or intolerances and those who care for them. ContentChecked originally launched in Norway where a 20% market share was quickly captured, and the U.S. version is on track to match the same growth rate. The company has received overwhelming support from food allergy and intolerance organizations. The ContentChecked app allows users to input their individual allergies into the app and then scan any bar code with their smartphone to determine if there is a food allergy in that particular item. MigraineChecked app addresses a person's migraine headache connections to certain foods; while the company's recently launched SugarChecked app highlights the sugar content of food and forms sugar takes in consumed food. ContentChecked Technology   First released in Norway with U.S. beta launch shortly thereafter in July 2014 	 Norway launch quickly achieved   	ContentChecked officially launched in February 2015 	 On track to match same market growth seen in Norway 		Company continues to build database of product information   	Proprietary barcode and scanner    MigraineChecked   Launched in August 2014 	Addressable core market of 36 million users 	Helps people suffering migraine to select safe and alternative products 	 Equally important for relatives, friends, and related persons   	Excellent tool to help migraine sufferers possibly reduce their migraine attacks 	 Improve efficiency and risk while shopping    SugarChecked App   Launched in the U.S. on June 23, 2015 	Addressable core market of 97 million users 	Will help consumers identify all sugars, including hidden sugars, in specific food items and offer alternative products without sugar 	 Serves as a "nutritionist in their pocket" to help them determine good food from bad and educate the user on why certain foods are worse or better    VeganChecked App   Launched in the U.S. on August 15, 2015 	Addressable core market of 16 million users     $13B Food Allergy & Intolerance Market   More than 75 % of the global population has some kind of food intolerance, creating a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. 	More than 15 million Americans suffer from food allergies. 	In the U.S., food allergy is the leading cause of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).

U.S. children with food allergies grows 5.1% per year.     U.S. Market Performance   The app is monetized by charging food producers monthly advertising fees in exchange for recommending their alternative product for sale to the user. Allergens selected will produce an "alternative" based on a scan of a product. The alternative product is one supported by a food manufacturer's advertising spend to market their alternative to the ContentChecked user.    Management The team of professionals at Content Checked are dedicated to making the world a better place, applying the vast benefits of how technology can improve our lives and those around us.
