R-Stack


This 600A connector has the connecting plug molded into the elbow body, eliminating the need for a separate piece. Our premolded composite is factory tested, with a greatly reduced installation force and stack height.The result: an easier, more reliable, and cheaper option than traditionally stacked elbows.More reliable — The R-Stack interface combines two units into one, eliminating the need for a connecting plug! This combination design reduces the risk of complications during assembly in the field, such as cross threading. And, each product is individually tested prior to shipment.Easier to install — Total assembly force is only 25 lbs., as opposed to the 100 lb. force required to install a standard connecting plug. Also, the traditional spanner and torque wrenches are no longer needed for the installation. All that’s required is a single installation tool (included with each kit).Smaller stack height — Using the R-Stack reduces the stack height 4” for every two elbows (a 20% reduction). Its reduced height makes the R-stack invaluable in small cabinets and manholes.Less expensive — Molding one part instead of two (elbow and connecting plug) reduces the cost. Plus, the R-Stack can be installed faster and is more reliable, which saves even more time and money!

HyperCard Snow Crystals

In the mid 1980’s I was deeply into a development tool called HyperCard and made hundreds of “stacks” (little applications) which I both sold and gave away.
For those who don’t remember it or never got into it, HyperCard, developed by then Apple Fellow Bill Atkinson was a highly addictive development tool that had a cult following. It was my first experience with application development and I got hooked.
I made so many HyperCard stacks in fact that I lost track of many of them and when HyperCard eventually died and stacks were difficult to keep running on modern hardware and operating systems I moved on.
Recently I heard from someone named Sandra who had one of my old stacks: a collection of scanned black and white images of snow crystals that if memory serves visually morph from one to the next as the stack flips through its cards. Sandra wanted permission to put the stack online and of course I was glad to give it given that I’d forgotten that I’d ever made it. For those who have the means or interest to run it, here it is: Snow Crystals.
Another one of my stacks that got a bit more recognition was The Bee.

The Bee

Leave a comment 



A long time ago there was this amazing multimedia development tool for the Macintosh called HyperCard. I got deeply into HyperCard in the nerdiest sense and built a lot of things with it. Most of the things I was building were reference tools for people with learning disabilities. After talking with a good friend who developed animated software using a competing product, HyperStudio, I decided it was time I tackled something animated with Hypercard. The result was a small piece of seemingly useless software called The Bee.
I built The Bee over an intensive two week period in about 1990. My wife thought I was nuts and couldn’t believe I was putting so much effort into this totally useless piece of software but as I got deeper and deeper into making it work, the rest of the world fell away and it was just me and The Bee and HyperTalk.

The idea was this: A bee would randomly fly around in a room with a person’s face in it. If the bee landed on the person’s nose it would sting them and their eyes would roll around (like little marbles). If the bee hit any solid wall 10 times it would turn upside down and gently glide to the bottom, dead. If the bee flew through one of the four openings in each room, the little window would animate so that it looked like the room was shifting to the side to display another room with another, different person. This room movement would go on forever with the bee buzzing and bumping into walls (making a bump noise) until the bee died or the user got tired of this stupid thing and held down a key to stop it.

To get the bee to fly randomly and keep all he rules going and hit the wall and make sound with the right timing to make it feel realistic was tough. However, I was up to the challenge and pulled numerous all-nighters getting this thing working. I scanned funny faces and put in numerous easter eggs: certain people had “wormholes” through their ears and if the bee entered one of their ears it would disappear, seemingly banging around inside their head, then emerge, either out of their other ear, or, if it was a special case, the window would shift and the bee would come out another person’s ear in another room. This, of course, delighted me and the more of it I figured out, the more I wanted to do.

After a few close friends helped me debug The Bee it was ready to give away. However, since all of the other software my wife and I had built was being sold (successfully I might add) as $5 shareware, we thought we might as well call The Bee shareware too and see if anyone was crazy enough to buy it. $2000 later my wife wasn’t laughing at me anymore. The Bee was getting around and people actually liked it, or, liked me enough to say that they liked it.

After a while my wife and I got very tired of filling software orders, copying and labeling disks, shrink wrapping jewel cases, printing invoices, mailing dozens of envelopes out, etc. Remember, this was pre-web and even though much of our software was up on AOL our biggest orders came in via the mail. So, eventually we stopped filling orders (sent checks back, etc.) and later, when I had a web site I put all the software we built up on it for people to download for free.

A few years later I heard that Berkeley Systems*, makers of the infamous After Dark Screen Saver program, first for the Mac, then for Windows, had an annual screen saver contest. On a whim, I decided to enter The Bee, thinking it might be an interesting screen saver if scaled up and colorized. It was no big deal to enter, sent them a disk and cover letter and promptly forgot about it.
Amazingly, a few months later I found out that I’d won first place in the contest and that a bunch of Mac hardware was on its way to me plus a check for $2000, plus a trophy. Well, the only thing I have left is the trophy and I must say, it’s a beauty and I feel sorry for anyone who tries to break into our house ’cause this trophy is heavy.
From time to time my wife looks at the trophy, then at me, laughs and rolls her eyes. She’s wondering when the next “bee” is gonna fly.
*The team who started and sold Berkeley Systems, Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, later started MoveOn.org.

Confusing Words


February 3, 2004Apple, Process, StoryApple, confusing words, dyslexia, HyperCard, learning disability, stackrwanderman

Leave a comment 



In 1990 my wife Anne came home from school and asked me if there was an easy way to collect the words that her students confused so that they might refer to their own lists on their own computers.
I put the question back to Anne: if you had such a list, what kinds of information about the confused words should be included, and how should the information look? I asked her to come up with some examples, the first few of which were effect and affect and there, their, and they’re. 
We decided that we needed to show each set of confusables together so that an easy comparison could be made. We also thought that the list would include more confusables than just homonyms, words like aggravate and irritate, and good and well. 
Each set of confusables would need:
– the two or more confused words
– definitions of each of the confused words
– multiple examples of usage in sentences of the confused words
Anne started collecting words, writing definitions, coming up with examples, and stored her collection in a text file until I could come up with another way.
 My job was to think about how the information could be most accessible to writers using conventional word processing software like MS Word or AppleWorks (ClarisWorks back then).
A few things to consider in looking at the history of this project:
– We were (and still are) Macintosh users and the schools we were both working with were using Macs as well.
– I had little experience with databases, although FileMaker and others were out at the time.
– I had a lot of experience with HyperCard, the first user-friendly multimedia development tool, and even though its products only ran on the Macintosh, cross platform development wasn’t a concern since the audience we were building this for was mainly Mac users who could run HyperCard programs.
– There was no web at the time, and the idea of putting information like this online and having people use an online tool was unheard of except in the mainframe computer world.
So, I built a HyperCard “stack” that included:
– a field to hold the confused words
– a field to hold the definitions
– a field to hold examples of usage.
In time, Anne and I finished the stack and sold it as shareware for many years. It did well and thousands of people bought and hopefully used it. (Hopefully is correct if our users were hopeful about becoming less confused.)
Here’s a screen shot of an entry:

Many things have changed in the computer world since Anne and I first started thinking about this:
– The Macintosh has been marginalized in schools
– The HyperCard project died at Apple
– We have mixed feelings about making and buying shrink-wrapped reference software because it’s out of date almost immediately
– The web has evolved into an important part of using a computer as a tool
– We know how to build web sites
So, we put Confusing Words on the web where it existed for many years. The code and site became out of date over time and we lost interest and so, we took it down and let the domain go. It was a great run and we learned a lot, both in building the HyperCard stack and in building the web site.

Dear May, Lin and Harley, we are sad to hear of Dick's passing, Rita and I send our love and best wishes your way.  Mr. Stack, as I knew him, offered me some advice in my youth that has stuck with me to this day.  He reminded me that anything made by one man can be repaired or recreated by another.  I have thought of this conversation thousands of times and it has helped me find the patience and determination to approach many difficult problems.  I have always wanted to thank him for that little bit of wisdom that had such a powerful impact on my life.

Dear May Harley and Lynn I would like to express my sincere condolences for the loss of your husband/father. I have known Dick for many years ever since I bought and operated the Countryside Store in 1977.  He was  very helpful to me on numerous locations and will never forget him for that. He was a crackerjack mechanic at anything he chose to  fix.  I will miss him.

600A 35kV R-Stack Arrester


Richards’ innovative 35kV R-Stack Surge Arrester is an ultra-efficient way to protect
underground cables/equipment from harmful over-voltages. Our Arrester is equipped
with gapless Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) technology, assembled within a fully-shielded,
submersible EPDM housing. By utilizing a Deadbreak R-Stack Elbow housing, several
critical advantages are afforded:

The R-Stack Arrester eliminates the need for Loadbreak surge arresters, 600A to 200A reducing tap plugs, connecting plugs, and bushing extenders. These components can be difficult to install and expensive. Additionally, having fewer required line items simplifies procurement and on-site material handling.
The R-Stack Arrester has a male Deadbreak interface molded into the Elbow itself. As a result of this integral design, the overall stack height of an R-Stack Arrester installed on a Deadbreak Elbow is significantly shorter than other configurations on the market.
Having fewer components/interfaces reduces the chance of improper installation—for example, crossthreading or contamination.
Installing fewer components simplifies assembly procedures and cuts down on total installation time.
200A Loadbreak arresters are only rated for 10kA of fault current—anything greater and the arrester will be detached from the mating component. Our 600A Deadbreak design is a bolted connection capable of withstanding fault currents of up to 40kA symmetrical per IEEE 386!

Richards 35kV 600A Arresters have been designed and tested per the following industry
standards and are 100% production-tested as follows:

ANSI/IEEE Std 386:
For Separable Insulated Connector Systems
IEEE Std C62.11:
For Metal Oxide Surge Arresters for AC Power Circuits
