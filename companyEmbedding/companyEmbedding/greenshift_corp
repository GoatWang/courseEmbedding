Products










Engineering a solution has always been at the heart of what GreenShift is accomplishing. Create an elegant, cost-effective and value-added product that takes advantage of what was once deemed a waste stream or otherwise low value coproduct. That is what GreenShift has done with all the technologies within its portfolio and what it will continue to do moving forward.
But evaluating waste streams for value added products is just the beginning. In order maximize value, continuous innovation is needed and that is what GreenShift has strived for in the numerous engineering and technology solutions it is brought to commercialization.
Corn Oil Extraction, the most established technology within GreenShift’s portfolio, is the crowning example of turning an otherwise low value coproduct into a highly sought after commodity in other markets. GreenShift’s cost effective and elegant design has transformed an industry and, in many cases, allowed businesses to survive in otherwise difficult financial times.
Biodiesel production, once relegated to only producers with integrated soybean crush facilities, has seen tremendous growth over the last 10 years. This has been a direct result of sourcing reliable new feedstocks. Further improving upon this model has been the ability for ethanol producers to take advantage of onsite infrastructure, energy and logistics capabilities to co-locate biodiesel production at their facilities. This has ushered in a new wave of renewable fuel ‘complexes’ that look to increase renewable fuel production from the same mass of grain.
While the focus initially has been on the renewable fuel market, GreenShift has always looked to evaluate waste streams and otherwise low value byproducts in other industries. One such industry is pulp and paper production where black liquor concentrate  presents another opportunity to extract a highly valuable, complex polymer, known as lignin, contained within an otherwise low value byproduct stream. Such a process would also have far reaching implications for renewable fuel production where cellulosic feedstocks are used and lignin is contained within its byproduct stream.
As GreenShift continues to evolve as a company, its core belief that innovation drives growth will not change. Being satisfied with the status quo is not something GreenShift strives for but rather the insatiable desire to develop and commercialize efficient technologies that bring otherwise unrealized profits to an industry.

About Us











History

GreenShift Corporation was founded on January 30, 2003 and is organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company.
From the onset, GreenShift has always focused on improving process efficiency through innovative engineering solutions. Initially, GreenShift's core business was specialty drying, however its extensive experience in innovative process technology led to the discovery of its patented corn oil extraction technology. From 2003 to 2005, extensive research and development was conducted to fully commercialize GreenShift’s corn oil extraction technology, culminating with two commercial installations in 2005.
As our mission statement outlines, GreenShift did not stop innovating and proceeded to perfect its extraction technology while adding additional intellectual property to its portfolio to increase corn oil yields. In June 2007, GreenShift's third commercial installation was completed and was closely followed by three additional installations in 2008. By this time, GreenShift's backend extraction process was viewed as the quickest and most cost effective solution for ethanol producers to increase revenues and was beginning to experience wide-spread adoption across the industry.
In October 2009, GreenShift received a patent issuance on its first corn oil extraction patent from the US Patent and Trademark Office. It has since received numerous additional patents related to its corn oil extraction processes and other clean technologies.
Currently, GreenShift has installed or licensed its patented corn oil extraction process to 36 ethanol facilities across the globe. Roughly 80% of the current corn-based, dry mill ethanol industry has adopted backed corn oil extraction, contributing over 1.8 billion lbs of feedstock annually to the biodiesel, renewable diesel, feed and industrial markets.
Moving forward, GreenShift will maintain its mission of developing and commercializing innovative clean technologies that increase the revenue and profitability of its licensees; taking advantage of untapped resources and improved process efficiencies.

Biodiesel










Co-located Biodiesel Production at Ethanol Facilities
The concept of co-locating biodiesel at ethanol plants has been a natural evolution of corn ethanol facilities that extract corn oil.  Today, as biodiesel production requirements are becoming more stabilized, integrating biodiesel at an ethanol facility can be a highly effective means to improve profits associated with corn oil extraction.
GreenShift offers its services to assist in facilitating the integration of such facilities.  GreenShift is available to provide oversight of a particular project or provide turn-key biodiesel installations.
While the biodiesel industry gains strength and has demonstrated consistent profitability, one can further improve margins through the integration of onsite biodiesel production.  Below are a few of the advantages of to those that integrate biodiesel production:

No Incoming Freight

Oil Produced On-Site will only require minimal amount of energy to pump the oil to the co-located biodiesel facility.  Generally speaking, about the same amount of energy otherwise required to fill an outbound corn oil truck.
Should additional volumes of corn oil be purchased from nearby ethanol facilities there would however be incoming freight costs however there could be freight advantageous as one may be closer in proximity than other potential buyers.

Reduced Outgoing Freight

Large Scale Biodiesel production facilities generally have to ship biodiesel greater distances as local communities cannot consume their full production volumes.  Smaller co-located production facilities however, generally have greater opportunities to sell a higher percentage of their production locally and can have reduced outgoing freight costs on a volumetric basis.  A significant amount of corn oil biodiesel can be sold back the local farming community who farms and transports its corn to the facility on a regular basis.

Infrastructure is already in place to support renewable fuel production and distribution

Facilities management, sales and accounting staff are already in place and can effectively manage the additional fuel produced.
Rail and trucking infrastructure also exists, thus minimizing the capital requirements of the project.

Technology advances allow for improved conversion rates and efficiencies over much of the infrastructure in place.

GreenShift welcomes the opportunity to assist ethanol producers maximize returns for corn oil.

  http://www.greenshift.com/  Mission  GreenShift Corporation's mission is to develop and commercialize innovative clean technologies that increase the revenue and profitability of its customers by improving process efficiencies and increasing the value of process co-products. These innovations accumulate over time generating significant financial returns for GreenShift and its partners, while providing significant improvements to the environment.   GreenShift — Natural Solutions ™  Patented Hemp Biocomposite Biodiesel Processing & Oil Extraction Technologies Important to read all SEC filings before investing in Greenshift which has a history of toxic financing!! http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001269127&owner=exclude&count=40&hidefilings=0 Plastics Traditional plastic manufacturing involves the use and creation of many toxins. Some plastics themselves are even declared to be toxic to humans. These include PCBs which disrupt hormones, PCTs - endocrime disrupters (which have now been outlawed, but not removed from the environment), non biodegradable phylates found in childrens' toys and PVC construction materials, and the hormonal disrupting Bisphenol A.   A biocomposite is a material formed by a matrix (resin) and a reinforcement of natural fibers (usually derived from plants or cellulose). With wide-ranging uses from environment-friendly biodegradable composites to biomedical composites for drug/gene delivery, tissue engineering applications and cosmetic orthodontics. They often mimic the structures of the living materials involved in the process in addition to the strengthening properties of the matrix that was used but still providing biocompatibility, e.g. in creating scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. Those markets are significantly rising, mainly because of the increase in oil price, and recycling and environment necessities. Biocomposites are characterised by the fact that:  The petrochemical resin is replaced by a vegetable or animal resin, and/or the bolsters (fiberglass, carbon fibre or talc) are replaced by natural fibre, wood fibers, hemp, etc.      Cellulose is the most common organic compound and biopolymer on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose. The cellulose content of wood is around 50%. The cellulose content of hemp is 67-78%. Hemp is the strongest cellulosic material know to man!     Hemp is an annual, fast-growing plant with 3-4 times the productivity of trees for paper production. Before 1900, paper was made from recycled rags which usually consisted of 75-90% hemp. Hemp paper is known to be durable and flexible and this has more recently been confirmed (Palni et al 1999). Pressures upon forests could be reduced and chemicals deposited into waterways would be reduced - sulphuric acids are not required to break hemp fibres into pulp and the product can be effectively bleached with the relatively harmless hydrogen peroxide rather than chlorine.          Hemp Biocomposite Processing Technology    Patent Issued: 8,598,256   Patent Issued: 8,449,986  Patent Allowed: 13/863,758  Patent Allowed: 13/892,347     Patent Allowed: 14/087,229           Title of Invention: MULTIFUNCTIONAL BIOCOMPOSITE ADDITIVE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS    4. The biopolymer of claim 2, wherein the fibers comprise wood fibers, agricultural fibers, flax fibers, hemp fibers, kenaf fibers, wheat fibers, soybean fibers, switchgrass fibers, grass fibers, fibrous waste from the paper or wood industries, fiberglass fibers, aramid fibers, carbon fibers, nylon, or combinations thereof.   The present additives and/or biopolymers can include a fiber additive. Suitable fibers include any of a variety of natural and synthetic fibers. Cellulose fibers include, without limitation, those from wood, agricultural fibers, including flax, hemp, kenaf, wheat, soybean, switchgrass, and grass, fibers obtained from paper and other fiber recycling, including, without limitation, household and industrial paper recycling streams, fibrous waste from the paper or wood industries, including paper mill sludge. Synthetic fibers include fiberglass, Kevlar, carbon fiber, nylon; mixtures or combinations thereof, and the like. Mineral or silica additives may also be used. The fiber can modify the performance of the biopolymers. For example, longer fibers can be added to biopolymers structural members to impart higher flexural and rupture modulus. In some embodiments, the DDS biocomposite additive or biopolymer can include about 0.001% to about 40% (HEMP) fiber.      .              Hemp bioplastics are non-toxic, lightweight, and very durable. Hemp is the strongest cellulosic material on the planet. According to Henry Ford, hemp plastic is 10x stronger than steel!     Car door made by a biocomposite of hemp fibers and polyethylene.  Did you know that Henry Ford spent more than a decade researching and building his model-T car which was not only constructed from hemp but was also designed to run off hemp bio-fuel?     10 x Stronger Than Steel In The 1940′s: Henry Ford’s HEMP Car.   http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/02/25/henry-ford-hemp-plastic-car-stronger/    An all-plastic car 300 pounds lighter than comparable models built of steel and having ten times the impact resistance of steel is near completion in the Ford plant at Dearborn, Mich., Popular Science Monthly announced last week. In a special interview, it was said, Henry Ford predicted that his test car, made of plastic body, hood and fenders, would be lighter, safer and less expensive. He added: "It will be a car of darn sight better design in every form. And don't forget the motor car business is just one of the industries that can find new uses for plastics, made from what's grown in the land!" -New York Times, 2 Feb 1941    Hemp Fiber for Food Packaging  As hemp fiber is known to have anti-bacterial properties, adding hemp to food packaging has the additional benefit of increasing preservation.  Poultry is considered to be easily spoilable by grocers, so anything that adds to the shelf life is welcome in the retail trade.  The interest in this kind of green packaging is being driven by both the industry and consumers. Manufacturers want lower costs and increased shelf life; consumers want fresh and safe food available in addition to products that reflect their values.  http://www.globalhemp.com/2014/02/hemp-fiber-for-food-packaging.html           Hemp Biodiesel   Hemp literally produces a "green" product when it's used to make biodiesel.      B100 Biodiesel    GreenShift Offices 5950 Shiloh Road East, Suite N Alpharetta, GA 30005 Phone: 212.994.5374 Fax: 770.886.2738 Hours of Operation: 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday Email: for general inquiries - info@greenshift.com          Green Plains Renewable Energy Implements Oil Extraction Technology.

While oil can be efficiently recovered from the thin stillage stream , we know that a considerable amount of oil bypasses the extraction system and exists within the WDG, or about 50% of the total oil that entered the facility.  To recover this oil, a Washing Technique is used where about 50 to 70% of the oil in the WDG is washed out of the wet cake and into the thin stillage stream.  Once the oil has been washed into the thin stillage stream, the highly efficient COES I system will extract the additional oil to allow about 75% of the oil entering the facility to be extracted.       COES I recovers oil from the Thin Stillage Stream  COES II relocates oil from the Wet Cake Stream to that of the Thin Stillage Stream where it is recovered by the COES I system  •Zero Starch Losses as compared to front end methods  •No negative impact on the front of the plant  •Can wash at any level 0-100%. You don’t have to go all-in on the first day and can slowly increase over time as you wish.  •Or, if more oil is desired, you can wash repeatedly (ie more than 100%, 200%, 300% etc..) to recover an even greater amount of oil.  http://www.fuelethanolworkshop.com/files/docs/2013/Winsness-David.pdf    GreenShift Patent Portfolio      Method and systems for enhancing oil recovery from ethanol production byproducts 8,168,037   Method of processing ethanol byproducts and related subsystems 8,008,516   Method of freeing the bound oil present in whole stillage and thin stillage 7,608,729   Method of processing ethanol byproducts and related subsystems 7,601,858   Method for continuous production of biodiesel fuel 7,935,840     Method of blending fuels and related system                                                                                     8,489,233  Method of enhancing oil recovery from ethanol production byproducts                        8,679,353                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                GreenShift’s Licensed Customers          CALGREN RENEWABLE FUELS     o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o                                                                                   ________________||__ ¦ GERS•PATENTED  ¦¦ ,\____„ ¦_...._..ETHANOIL___¦¦==¦"'"""'¦ /(©)¤(©) ¤¤¤ (©)¨(©)¨¨¨ (©)¨ °----°----°----°----°----°----°----°---   Corn Oil & Medical Marijuana Corn oil will kill soft-bodied insects by plugging up breathing tubes on their body. The oil can also combat powdery mildew disease that can affect numerous types of crops. It puts an oily coating on the leaf, then the fungus doesn’t get the chemical signals it needs to find its way into the plant. It’s pretty simple, but it’s pretty effective.   Medicinal marijuana farmers prefer using corn oil as a pesticide due to its safety. They grow indoors so the humidity is very bad; they don’t ventilate a lot so you got the powdery mildew fungus growing in there, and they usually get insect problems, usually with aphids. They don’t want to spray indoors with a bunch of toxic stuff, so they always use the organics. Currently, California is the biggest, organic producing and consuming state. These corn oil-based products will be used on pretty much any organic crop. Everything from all the high-end berry crops to vegetables to marijuana.

GreenShift executes agreement to invest in Ovation products
































Sponsored by












MOUNT ARLINGTON, NJ, Aug. 9, 2005 (PRNewswire-FirstCall) -- GreenShift Corp. has executed agreements to invest in Ovation Products Corp., a development stage company with patented and proprietary technologies involving new implementations of vapor compression distillation.
Ovation has invested over $9 million developing technology that offers dramatic price and performance advantages over competing clean water technologies. Ovation is finalizing the development of its initial product, the Clean Water Appliance -- a fire-hydrant sized appliance that can generate 25 gallons of pure water per hour from a variety of dirty water input sources at a cost of about $0.004 per gallon, or about 1.2% of the cost of traditional home distillation methods. Ovation expects that its Clean Water Appliance will be available in the fourth quarter 2005 and will sell for a fraction of the price of commercial distillation systems.
To achieve this small size, low cost efficiency, Ovation's products incorporate new implementations of a distillation process called vapor compression. It has been granted 11 patents for its technology and system, and has filed for an additional five patents to date.[Native Advertisement]
Vapor Compression DistillationDistillation is the "gold standard" for water purification in that it removes bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, suspended solids and almost all chemicals. It is the single most effective method for purifying water. Other processes such as ultra filtration and reverse osmosis do not produce perfect water quality, discharge several times more wastewater, degrade over time, and require replacement of filters and cartridges. Ovation's products provide a consistent high quality output and require no filter or cartridges.
"Most distillation methods lose a lot of energy in the form of heat," said Bill Zebuhr, Ovation's chairman, founder, chief technology officer, and the inventor of Ovation's technology. "It takes 1,000 BTUs to vaporize a pound of water, which is equal to about a pint. Purifying water accordingly costs about $0.35 per gallon with a conventional home distiller. Vapor compression distillation enables the iterative recovery and reuse of the heat of vaporization to evaporate successive batches of water while dirty concentrate is continuously discharged from the system."
Zebuhr has refined the efficiency of Ovation's technology to the point where Ovation has been able to reduce energy loss by over 98% and distill water for about 1.2% of the cost of traditional home methods. Ovation believes that the Ovation Clean Water Appliance is the most efficient commercial distiller in the world, of any size.
The Water Purification and Treatment IndustryDue to the decline in water quality or access to potable water, several million people die every year from water contaminated by solvents, pesticides, industrial wastes, lead, and other pollutants. The World Health Organization estimates that, globally, nearly 3.5 billion people are without potable water or basic sanitation, and quantifies the costs associated with this problem at about $11.3 billion by 2015. While most of these deaths occur in developing countries, some also occur in industrialized countries.
Within the United States, much of the population lives in metropolitan areas with established water and wastewater systems in place. However, many of these existing, older water and wastewater systems are in desperate need of repair. Industry consultants estimate that between 10% and 40% of water transported via the existing water systems is lost through leakage and inaccurate metering. Also, more individuals are moving to less developed areas, with the most rapid population growth occurring in resource-constrained areas with underdeveloped and inadequate infrastructure. Compounding this strain is that many of the regions experiencing the rapid growth also have significant water scarcity issues.
Additionally, various industries use significant amounts of water in the fabrication of products and the cooling and washing of equipment. For example, in the semiconductor industry, about 2,800 to 3,200 gallons of water are required to make a single eight-inch wafer. These high-water demand industries are looking to cut costs by maintaining clean water in the process loop via water treatment systems that discharge a minimum amount of effluent.
The overall result of the increasingly limited supply of drinking water, economic expansion, the increasing need for large quantities of purified water by commercial and industrial companies, heightened public health and safety concerns relating to drinking water, and the promulgation of stringent, complex, and costly governmental regulations is an increased demand on the water purification and treatment industry to develop efficient cost-effective water-treatment systems for various sectors of society. These sectors include the household, consumer, bottled water, commercial and industrial, municipal and waste treatment markets, among others.
A New Business ModelOvation does not currently anticipate selling standalone products to the public or as a stand-alone appliance. Instead, Ovation anticipates working with key strategic partners in a number of industries that will integrate Ovation's distillation technology into a variety of appliances, products and services. Ovation will design, market and manufacture different component distillers, which utilize its core distillation technology and are built to meet specifications requested by its corporate partners. Because of Ovation's unique technology and strong patent position, it has been and expects to be able to negotiate favorable licensing terms with its corporate partners for specific applications. Additionally, Ovation plans to sub-contract manufacturing of its Clean Water Appliance and parts to one or more specialty metal manufacturers.
"We have successfully developed our technology to the point where it is cost-effective at the residential scale," said Bob MacDonald, Ovation's chief executive officer. "We believe that this is a tremendous achievement that can have profound implications on how we use our water resources today."
"The philosophy underlying Ovation's technology is perfectly aligned with GreenShift's focus today," said Kevin Kreisler, chairman and chief executive officer of GreenShift. "We believe that we can enable substantial environmental gains by developing and supporting practical solutions that make it easy and cost-effective for residential and commercial consumers to reduce waste and increase recycling and reuse."
"It is our view that these solutions must profitably and seamlessly integrate with our daily lives and existing infrastructure in order to gain acceptance and bring to pass compelling environmental gains. Ovation's technology achieves this and I am personally thrilled to include this important company in our portfolio," said Kreisler.
Under the terms of its agreement with Ovation, GreenShift will purchase 200,000 shares, or about 9.39%, of Ovation's outstanding stock for $1 million and GreenShift has the option to acquire an additional 400,000 shares of Ovation common stock at $6.00 per share. Ovation recently filed to become publicly traded and expects to commence trading later this year.
GreenShift Corp. (www.greenshift.com) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) whose mission is to develop and support companies and technologies that facilitate the efficient use of natural resources and catalyze transformational environmental gains. BDCs are essentially publicly-traded equity funds where shareholders and financial institutions provide capital in a regulated environment for investment in a pool of long-term, small and middle-market companies. GreenShift's current portfolio includes investments in the following environmentally proactive companies: Veridium Corp.; INSEQ Corp.; GreenWorks Corp.; GreenShift Industrial Design Corp.; Coriolis Energy Corp.; TDS (Telemedicine) Inc.; Ethanol Oil Recovery Systems Inc.; Sterling Planet Inc.; and, Ovation Products Corp. In addition, GreenShift hopes to add investments in wind power, hydropower, practical centralized applications of hydrogen power, alternative fuels, infrastructure and mining to its portfolio during 2005 and 2006.

GreenShift And Corn LP Enter Into License Agreement






Business Wire




Oct 20, 2010 8:45 AM EDT













 


















































  GreenShift Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GERS) announced today its execution of a license agreement with Corn, LP for use of GreenShift’s patented corn oil extraction technologies at Corn, LP’s 50 million gallon ethanol plant in Goldfield, Iowa.  Under the terms of the agreement, Corn, LP will finance, build and operate a new corn oil extraction facility based on GreenShift’s patented corn oil extraction processes. In addition, GreenShift will provide Corn, LP with ongoing technical support with a view towards maximizing the performance and benefits of Corn, LP’s planned new corn oil extraction installation.  Brad Davis, General Manager of Corn, LP said that “We have set a number of new performance records at Corn, LP within the past year, with record levels of ethanol and DDGS production from our plant as well as improved operating efficiencies. We are confident that the addition of GreenShift’s patented corn oil extraction processes to our facility will help us build on our successes with additional improvements in efficiency and profitability.”  “We are excited to partner with Brad and his team and we are eager to get to work bringing the many positive benefits of corn oil extraction to Corn, LP," said David Winsness, Chief Technology Officer of GreenShift.  GreenShift’s technical services staff are available at 888-ETHANOIL or sales@greenshift.com to respond to quotation requests and to answer any questions about GreenShift’s patented corn oil extraction and other technologies.  About GreenShift Corporation  GreenShift Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GERS) develops and commercializes clean technologies designed to address the financial and environmental needs of its clients by decreasing raw material needs, facilitating co-product reuse, and reducing the generation of wastes and emissions.  GreenShift’s mission is to build shareholder value by using its technologies to catalyze disruptive environmental gain. GreenShift believes that the first, best and most cost-effective way to achieve this is to develop technology-driven economic incentives that motivate large populations of people and companies to make incremental environmental contributions that are collectively very significant. With adoption by most of the U.S. ethanol industry, GreenShift’s commercially-available technologies can give way to disruptive gains by enabling sustainably increased production of globally-meaningful quantities of renewable fuels for distribution through existing supply chains.

GreenShift Announces Testing Of Tornado Technology On Food Products


Mount Arlington, NJ - GreenShift Corporation announced that an early-stage prototype of GreenShift's proprietary Tornado Generator technology is being evaluated for efficacy in processing food products by a domestic based multi-national food products company. 

GreenShift's Tornado Generator accelerates compressed air to supersonic speeds in a closed cyclonic chamber where the air is powerful enough to almost instantly grind, flash desiccate and atomize solid and liquid wastes and other materials into micron sized powders. 

GreenShift's proprietary Tornado Generator is a completely contained system with no internal moving parts that is powered by compressed air. It can safely, cost-effectively and rapidly process a very broad array of wastes including agricultural wastes, septic wastes, municipal solid wastes, industrial wastes, mining wastes and construction and demolition wastes. 

"While waste materials are a clear application for this technology, we believe that the Tornado Generator(TM) also facilitates the more efficient use natural resources upstream directly in production processes," said Kevin Kreisler, GreenShift's chairman and chief executive officer. "We believe that most industrial processes that involve some form of grinding, pulverizing, mixing, and/or drying can be improved upon with implementations of this technology. Agriproducts in particular represents a compelling area for improvement in this regard and can be a relatively rapid path to cash flows. We are very excited to have the opportunity to work with established market leaders as we evaluate a number of these applications today." 

The early-stage prototypes of one of the technologies used in certain applications of GreenShift's Tornado Generator were initially developed to grind wheat and to improve the processing of poultry wastes. Video demonstrations of both such applications are available on GreenShift's website.
