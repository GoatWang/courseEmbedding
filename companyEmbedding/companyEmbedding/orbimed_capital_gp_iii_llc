About Us


From biopharmaceuticals to medical devices, diagnostics, and healthcare services, OrbiMed is scouting the globe for innovations that will help ensure humanity lives healthier, longer and more productive lives.
 We have been investing globally for over 20 years across the healthcare industry: from early-stage private companies to large multinational corporations. Our team of over 80 distinguished scientific, medical, investment and other professionals manage approximately $13 billion across public and private company investments worldwide.



 

Life Sciences Focus
The global healthcare industry sits at the intersection of several powerful long-term growth trends led by global demographics and the ineluctable advance of scientific innovation in treating disease. These trends have caused a steady increase in the level of healthcare spending in the industrialized world, led by the U.S. which now spends over 17% of its GDP on healthcare. The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.





Firm History
To thrive, organisms need to adapt and grow. So do investment firms. Through 25 years of volatile, changing investment environments, we've embraced new opportunities and expanded our global footprint.

Item 1.  Security and Issuer
 

This Amendment No. 7 to Schedule 13D supplements and amends the Statement on Schedule 13D of OrbiMed Advisors LLC, OrbiMed Capital GP III LLC and Samuel D. Isaly originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 19, 2014 (the “Statement”) and amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on February 20, 2015, Amendment No. 2 filed on May 14, 2015, Amendment No. 3 filed on August 17, 2015, Amendment No. 4 filed on March 17, 2016, Amendment No. 5 filed on March 31, 2016 and Amendment No. 6 filed on September 26, 2016.  The Statement relates to the common stock, nominal value €0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Affimed N.V. (formerly Affimed Therapeutics B.V.), a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap) organized under the laws of the Netherlands (the “Issuer”), with its principal executive offices located at Im Neuenheimer Feld 582, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.  The Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “AFMD.”  Information given in response to each item shall be deemed incorporated by reference in all other items, as applicable.
 
On January 25, 2017, the Issuer closed a registered direct offering announced on January 19, 2017.  The Issuer issued in the offering a total of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $1.80 per share of Common Stock (“Shares”) with gross proceeds of approximately $18,000,000 (the “Share Issuance”).  As a result of the Share Issuance, the Issuer’s total number of outstanding Shares increased to 43,259,404 (the “Outstanding Share Increase”).  None of the Reporting Persons participated in the offering.  As a result of the Share Issuance (and more specifically, the Outstanding Share Increase), the percentage of outstanding Shares that the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own was reduced by more than one percent of the Issuer’s Shares outstanding since the filing of Amendment No. 6 to the Statement.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
 
Not applicable.
 
Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction
 
Not applicable.  As described more fully in Item 1 above, the event giving rise to the obligation of the Reporting Persons to file this Amendment No. 7 did not involve any transactions effected by one or more Reporting Persons with respect to the Shares.  The Shares initially had been acquired (and those that continue to be held, are held) by the Reporting Persons for the purpose of making an investment in the Issuer and not with the intention of acquiring control of the Issuer’s business.
 
The Reporting Persons from time to time intend to review their investment in the Issuer on the basis of various factors, including the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuer’s Common Stock in particular, as well as other developments and other investment opportunities.  Based upon such review, the Reporting Persons will take such actions in the future as the Reporting Persons may deem appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time.  If the Reporting Persons believe that further investment in the Issuer is attractive, whether because of the market price of the Common Stock or otherwise, they may acquire shares or other securities of the Issuer either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Similarly, depending on market and other factors, the Reporting Persons may determine to dispose of some or all of the Shares currently owned by the Reporting Persons or otherwise acquired by the Reporting Persons either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
 
Except as set forth in this Amendment No. 7 to the Statement, the Reporting Persons have not formulated any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in:  (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of securities of the Issuer, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (e) any material change in the Issuer’s capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer, (f) any other material change in the Issuer’s business or corporate structure, (g) any change in the Issuer’s charter or bylaws or other instrument corresponding thereto or other action which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person, (h) causing a class of the Issuer’s securities to be deregistered or delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, (i) a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
 
Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer
 
(a)-(b)   As of the date of this filing, Advisors, GP III and Isaly may be deemed, for purposes of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, directly or indirectly, including by reason of their mutual affiliation, to be the beneficial owners of the Common Stock described in Item 6 below.  Based upon information contained in the most recent available filing by the Issuer with the SEC, such Common Stock deemed to be indirectly beneficially owned by GP III constitutes approximately 7.00% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, and such Common Stock deemed to be indirectly beneficially owned by Advisors and Isaly constitutes approximately 7.06% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock.  Advisors, pursuant to its authority as the sole managing member of GP III, which is the sole general partner of OPI III, and as the sole general partner of Associates III, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the Common Stock held by OPI III and Associates III.  GP III, pursuant to its authority as the general partner of OPI III, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the Common Stock held by OPI III.  Isaly, pursuant to his authority as the managing member of Advisors and owner of a controlling interest in Advisors, pursuant to its limited liability company agreement, may be deemed to also indirectly beneficially own the Common Stock attributable to Advisors.  As a result, Isaly, Advisors and GP III share the power to direct the vote and the disposition of the Shares held by OPI III described in Item 6 below, and Isaly and Advisors share the power to direct the vote and the disposition of the Shares held by Associates III described in Item 6 below.

In addition, Advisors and GP III, pursuant to their authority under the limited partnership agreements of OPI III and/or Associates III, as more particularly referred to in Item 6 below, prior to the date of this filing, caused OPI III and Associates III, as applicable, together with certain other shareholders of the Issuer (collectively with OPI III and Associates III, the “Selling Shareholders”) to enter into agreements substantially in the form filed as Exhibit 4 to Amendment No. 1 to the Statement (the “Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements”) with the Issuer’s managing directors and certain of the Issuer’s supervisory directors and consultants (the “Beneficiaries”), as described in Item 6 below.

In addition to the relationships between the Reporting Persons described in Items 2, 3 and 5 above, GP III is the sole general partner of OPI III, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OPI III.  Advisors is the sole managing member of GP III, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of GP III, and the sole general partner of Associates III, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of Associates III.  Pursuant to these agreements and relationships, Advisors and GP III have discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OPI III, and Advisors has discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of Associates III.  Such authority includes the power of GP III and Advisors to vote and otherwise dispose of securities purchased by OPI III, and the power of Advisors to vote and otherwise dispose of securities purchased by Associates III.  The number of outstanding Shares held of record by OPI III is 3,026,927, and the number of outstanding Shares held of record by Associates III is 28,073.  Advisors and Isaly may be considered to hold indirectly 3,055,000 Shares, and GP III may be considered to hold indirectly 3,026,927 Shares.
 

On June 29, 2015, Michael B. Sheffery, a Partner Emeritus of Advisors, retired from the board of directors of the Issuer at the expiration of his term.
     
Registration Rights Agreement
 
The Issuer is party to a registration rights agreement among OPI III, Associates III, SGR Sagittarius Holding AG, BioMed Invest I Ltd., LSP III Omni Investment Coöperatief U.A. and Novo Nordisk A/S dated September 17, 2014 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), a summary of which is set forth at Item 6 of Amendment No. 3 to the Statement.  All of the Shares held by OPI III and Associates III, with the exception of the Shares covered by the Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements, were registered on the F-3 Registration Statement.
 
Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements
 
In connection with the Issuer’s initial public offering, Advisors and GP III, pursuant to their authority under the limited partnership agreements of OPI III and/or Associates III, caused OPI III and Associates III, as applicable, together with the other Selling Shareholders, to enter into the carve-out agreements with the Beneficiaries described in the Statement (the “Original Carve-Out Agreements”).  On February 17, 2015, the Selling Shareholders entered into a termination agreement pursuant to which the Selling Shareholders and the Beneficiary agreed to terminate the Original Carve-Out Agreement with such Beneficiary for the future and to replace it by individual Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements between each Selling Shareholder and the Beneficiary.

8 of 12
     

The Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements grant each Beneficiary the right to receive a payment equal to a certain percentage of the fair value of the Issuer contingent upon the occurrence of a defined event, including an initial public offering.  Following the expiration of applicable lock-up agreements, (i) the obligations of OPI III and Associates III under the Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements are satisfied through a transfer to the Beneficiaries of an amount of shares of Common Stock in the aggregate amount of 379,023 shares, and (ii) portions of these shares are sold pursuant to Rule 144 to satisfy withholding taxes triggered by the transfer and delivered to the Beneficiaries with the net amount of shares to which each Beneficiary is entitled to receive pursuant to his or her individual Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Amended and Restated Carve-Out Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 3 to Amendment No. 1 to the Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.  Other than as described in this Amendment No. 7 to the Statement, to the best of the Reporting Persons’ knowledge, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in Item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer.
