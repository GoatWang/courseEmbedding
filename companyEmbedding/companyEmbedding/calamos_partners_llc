21-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and since inception returns are as of 3/31/17. Average annual total return measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments as an annualized average. All performance shown assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Performance shown reflects an expense reimbursement that improved results. Load-adjusted returns are adjusted for the maximum front-end sales load of 4.75% for Class A shares (3.75% for Total Return Bond Fund). Class B shares have a declining contingent deferred sales charge over six years, with a maximum of 5% in year one (3.50% for Total Return Bond Fund Class B shares). Class B shares automatically convert to A shares after eight years. There is a 1% contingent deferred sales charge for C shares on certain redemptions within the first year of purchase. Class B and C shares have been adjusted for the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). There are no contingent deferred sales charges or distribution or service fees with respect to Class I shares. The minimum initial investment required to purchase each Fund's Class I shares is $1 million. Class I shares are offered primarily for direct investment by investors through certain tax-exempt retirement plans (including 401(k) plans, 457 plans, employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, profit sharing and money purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans and non qualified deferred compensation plans) and by institutional clients, provided such plans or clients have assets of at least $1 million. Class I shares may also be offered to certain other entities or programs, including, but not limited to, investment companies, under certain circumstances.

1 Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. 

The Convertible Opportunities & Income Fund’s (CHI) most recent distribution was $0.0950 per share. 
The Convertible & High Income Fund’s (CHY) most recent distribution was $0.1000 per share. 
The Global Dynamic Income Fund’s (CHW) most recent distribution was $0.0700 per share. 
The Strategic Total Return Fund’s (CSQ) most recent distribution was $0.0825 per share. 
The Global Total Return Fund’s (CGO) most recent distribution was $0.1000 per share. 

Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to  re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.

Market Price is the price that the fund closed at on the primary listing exchange on the as of date referenced above.

NAV is the net asset value of the fund on the as of date referenced above and equals the value of all the fund's assets (less liabilities) divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Premium/Discount is the percentage difference between the net asset value of a fund and the market price.


Past Performance

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb. 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Calamos Partners LLC ("Calamos Partners") and its subsidiary, CPCM Acquisition, Inc. (the "Acquirer"), today announced the completion of its acquisition of Calamos Asset Management, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CLMS) ("CAM"). Following the completion of its successful tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the Class A common stock of CAM for $8.25 per share in cash, the Acquirer acquired all remaining CAM shares through a merger under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.








At the effective time of the merger, all remaining shares of CAM Class A common stock not tendered into the tender offer (other than shares owned by Calamos Partners and its affiliates, and shares for which appraisal was properly sought under applicable law) were automatically converted into the right to receive $8.25 in cash, which is the same price that was paid in the tender offer.  As a result of the transaction, CAM has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Calamos Partners.

NAPERVILLE, Ill., Dec. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Calamos Asset Management, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CLMS) ("CAM") announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle to be acquired by an entity (the "Acquirer") formed by Mr. John Calamos and Mr. John Koudounis. Mr. Calamos is the founder of Calamos Investments LLC, the operating company of CAM, and CAM's Chairman.  Mr.  Koudounis is the Chief Executive Officer of CAM.  Pursuant to the agreement in principle, the Acquirer will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of CAM not owned by the Acquirer for $8.25 per share in cash.  Promptly after the closing of the tender offer, any shares not tendered in the tender offer (other than shares owned by Acquirer, and shares for which appraisal is properly sought under applicable law) will be acquired in a second-step merger at the same cash price as paid in the tender offer.  The agreement in principle is subject to the final negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, but is not contingent on the Acquirer obtaining financing.








CAM's Board of Directors formed an independent Special Committee after Mr. Calamos and Mr. Koudounis expressed an interest in a possible transaction in October. The Special Committee reviewed the acquisition proposal, and considered various options available to CAM, including remaining a public company.  The Special Committee concluded unanimously that the proposed transaction, subject to negotiation of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, would be fair and in the best interests of the Company's public shareholders, and has approved the agreement in principle.
Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Mr. Calamos said:   "As investors at Calamos, we have always taken the long view.  I believe a fully private ownership structure will enable John Koudounis to focus on managing our business to his vision for our firm's long-term growth."
Mr. Koudounis added:  "Upon arriving at Calamos, I directed an extensive analysis of our corporate structure. Being a fully private company—consistent with 95% of asset managers today—will allow us to manage the business with the same long-term view that we apply to our investment approach. By eliminating the distraction of the market's increased focus on short-term metrics, we can be singularly dedicated to improving our key performance areas."
As of September 30, 2016, CAM owned 22.2% of Calamos Investments, with the remaining 77.8% being privately owned by Calamos Partners LLC. Mr. Calamos, other Calamos family members and Mr. Koudounis, directly and indirectly own 100% of Calamos Partners.  Calamos Partners also owns all of CAM's outstanding Class B common stock, which represents 97.4% of the combined voting power of all classes of CAM's voting stock. 
Forward Looking Statements
Any statements made in this communication that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about the expected timetable for completing the transaction and the potential effects of the acquisition, are forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, certain assumptions and current expectations and should be evaluated as such. These statements may be identified by their use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "expects," "projects," "anticipates," "intends" and other similar words. Forward-looking statements include statements that may relate to CAM's or the Acquirer's plans, objectives, strategies, goals, future events, future revenues or performance, and other information that is not historical information. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability of the parties to finally negotiate and execute a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement; the satisfaction of the conditions to the tender offer and the merger that will be contained in the definitive merger agreement; the absence of certain material adverse changes in the business of CAM; and general economic, business and market conditions.  For a more complete discussion of certain of the risks and uncertainties with respect to the business of CAM, see the discussion of risks and uncertainties in CAM's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, other reports CAM files under the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well as the tender offer documents to be filed by the Acquirer and by CAM. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date that the press release is issued, and CAM undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
Important Additional Information and Where to Find It
Following the final negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, it is anticipated that the Acquirer will commence a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of CAM. The tender offer has not yet commenced, and is subject to the final negotiation and execution of the definitive merger agreement. This communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of CAM, nor is it a substitute for the tender offer materials that the Acquirer will file with the SEC upon commencement of the tender offer. At the time that the tender offer is commenced, the Acquirer will file tender offer materials on Schedule TO with the SEC, and CAM will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with respect to the offer. THE TENDER OFFER MATERIALS (INCLUDING AN OFFER TO PURCHASE, A RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TENDER OFFER DOCUMENTS) AND THE SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY AND CONSIDERED BY CAM'S STOCKHOLDERS BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE TENDER OFFER. Both the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement will be made available to CAM's stockholders free of charge. A free copy of the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement will also be made available to all stockholders of CAM by contacting CAM at IR@calamos.com or by phone at +1.630.245.7200, or by visiting CAM's website (www.calamos.com). In addition, the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement (and all other documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC's website (www.sec.gov) upon filing with the SEC. CAM'S STOCKHOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE TENDER OFFER STATEMENT AND THE SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT, IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, AS EACH MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BEFORE THEY MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE TENDER OFFER, IF IT IS COMMENCED, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION.

(the "Acquirer"), today announced the completion of its acquisition of Calamos Asset Management, Inc. (CLMS) ("CAM"). Following the completion of its successful tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the Class A common stock of CAM for $8.25 per share in cash, the Acquirer acquired all remaining CAM shares through a merger under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.At the effective time of the merger, all remaining shares of CAM Class A common stock not tendered into the tender offer (other than shares owned by Calamos Partners and its affiliates, and shares for which appraisal was properly sought under applicable law) were automatically converted into the right to receive $8.25 in cash, which is the same price that was paid in the tender offer.  As a result of the transaction, CAM has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Calamos Partners. To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/calamos-partners-llc-completes-acquisition-of-calamos-asset-management-inc-300411019.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe best-performing stock in the Dow this year is rallying on blockbuster earningsBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAmazon profit slumps 77 percent as costs surge, shares fallReutersMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredVerizon Q2 Revenue Flat as Wireless Unit Sales Decline 1.9% Despite Subcriber ReboundVarietyTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.

Calamos Asset Management Stock Sees Short Interest Decline 63%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 12/30/2016 settlement date, which shows a 311,208 share decrease in total short interest for Calamos Asset Management Incorporated , to 183,251, a decrease of 62.94% since 12/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
