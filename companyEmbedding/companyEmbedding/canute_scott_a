CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genzyme        Corporation (NASDAQ: GENZ) announced today that Scott Canute, the        former manufacturing head at Eli Lilly & Company and a respected leader        in the field, joined the company as President of Global Manufacturing        and Corporate Operations. In this position, Mr. Canute will oversee the        production of a diverse range of products manufactured at 17 sites        around the world.             “Scott Canute is among the very top people in the pharmaceutical        manufacturing field,” said Henri A.

His experience will accelerate efforts to        strengthen our manufacturing sites, and consistently meet world-class        standards.”             “I am very excited to be joining Genzyme, which clearly has such a        strong history of innovation and excellence,” said Scott Canute. “I look        forward to helping the company achieve the manufacturing capabilities        that are necessary to fully serve the patients that depend on our        products - both now and in the future.”             Last month, Genzyme also announced that Ron Branning, a leader in the        field of product quality, joined the company as Senior Vice President of        Global Product Quality.

He has        also managed multiple product launches and the development of new        manufacturing sites. During his tenure, Lilly’s manufacturing training        programs became models in the industry.             Mr. Canute holds a degree in chemical engineering from the University of        Michigan, and a masters in business administration from Harvard Business        School. He was also a National Association of Manufacturers board        member. In 2007, Mr. Canute left Lilly to pursue educational interests        in business leadership and ethics.

		Scott Canute Joins Genzyme to Head Manufacturing and Corporate 
      Operations	
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--Genzyme 
      Corporation announced today that Scott Canute, the 
      former manufacturing head at Eli Lilly & Company and a respected
leader 
      in the field, joined the company as President of Global Manufacturing

      and Corporate Operations. In this position, Mr. Canute will oversee
the 
      production of a diverse range of products manufactured at 17 sites 
      around the world.
    
“He is widely respected for transforming 
      manufacturing operations at Lilly and establishing its programs as a 
      standard for the industry. His experience will accelerate efforts to 
      strengthen our manufacturing sites, and consistently meet world-class

      standards.”

      “Scott Canute is among the very top people in the pharmaceutical 
      manufacturing field,” said Henri A. Termeer, Genzyme’s chairman and 
      chief executive officer. “He is widely respected for transforming 
      manufacturing operations at Lilly and establishing its programs as a 
      standard for the industry. His experience will accelerate efforts to 
      strengthen our manufacturing sites, and consistently meet world-class

      standards.”
    

      “I am very excited to be joining Genzyme, which clearly has such a 
      strong history of innovation and excellence,” said Scott Canute. “I
look 
      forward to helping the company achieve the manufacturing capabilities

      that are necessary to fully serve the patients that depend on our 
      products - both now and in the future.”
    

      Last month, Genzyme also announced that Ron Branning, a leader in the

      field of product quality, joined the company as Senior Vice President
of 
      Global Product Quality. The hiring of new leadership in Manufacturing

      and Quality is part of Genzyme’s comprehensive plan to strengthen its

      global manufacturing operations.
    

      Mr. Canute held progressively responsible positions at Lilly,
ultimately 
      becoming President of Global Manufacturing Operations. In this role,
he 
      directed all manufacturing and supply chain activities for the
company’s 
      operations, which spanned 24 global manufacturing sites and more than
80 
      contract manufacturing operations. Mr. Canute oversaw operations that

      included more than 14,000 employees, and that supplied product to
more 
      than 140 countries. He also has experience with a variety of 
      technologies, including biologics, small and large molecules, and 
      devices.
    

      During his 25-year career, he has resolved significant challenges, 
      including FDA warning letters and 483 post-inspection letters. He has

      also managed multiple product launches and the development of new 
      manufacturing sites. During his tenure, Lilly’s manufacturing
training 
      programs became models in the industry.
    

      Mr. Canute holds a degree in chemical engineering from the University
of 
      Michigan, and a masters in business administration from Harvard
Business 
      School. He was also a National Association of Manufacturers board 
      member. In 2007, Mr. Canute left Lilly to pursue educational
interests 
      in business leadership and ethics.
