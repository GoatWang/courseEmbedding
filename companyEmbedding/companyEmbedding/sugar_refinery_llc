A sugar refinery is a refinery which processes raw sugar into white refined sugar or that processes sugar beet to refined sugar.
Many cane sugar mills produce raw sugar, which is sugar that still contains molasses, giving it more colour (and impurities) than the white sugar which is normally consumed in households and used as an ingredient in soft drinks and foods. While cane sugar does not need refining to be palatable, sugar from sugar beet is almost always refined to remove the strong, almost always unwanted, taste of beets from it. The refined sugar produced is more than 99 percent pure sucrose.
Whereas many sugar mills only operate during a limited time of the year during the cane harvesting period, many cane sugar refineries work the whole year round. Sugar beet refineries tend to have shorter periods when they process beet but may store intermediate product and process that in the off-season.
Raw sugar is either processed into white refined sugar in local refineries, and sold to the local industry and consumers, or it is exported and refined in the country of destination. Sugar refineries are often located in heavy sugar-consuming regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Since the 1990s many state-of-the art sugar refineries have been built in the Middle East and North Africa region, e.g. in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Algeria. The world´s largest sugar refinery company is American Sugar Refining with facilities in North America and Europe.

Raw sugar processing[edit]
Affination[edit]




Raw sugar storage in a sugar refinery


The raw sugar is stored in large warehouses and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with heavy syrup and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the affination process.
Screening[edit]
The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup (about 70 percent by weight solids), which is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide that combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they are skimmed off.
After any remaining solids are filtered out, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or, in more modern plants, ion-exchange resin.
Sugar house[edit]




Vacuum pans






Continuous sugar centrifugal for recovery products


The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized under vacuum to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging. To produce granulated sugar, in which the individual sugar grains do not clump together, sugar must be dried.
Sugar drying and storage[edit]
Drying is accomplished first by drying the sugar in a hot rotary dryer, and then by blowing cool air through Centrifugal Blower/fan it for several days in so-called conditioning silos. The finished product is stored in large concrete or steel silos. It is shipped in bulk, big bags or 25 – 50 kg bags to industrial customers or packed in consumer-size packages to retailers.
The dried sugar must be handled with caution, as sugar dust explosions are possible. For example, a sugar dust explosion which led to 13 fatalities was the 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion in Port Wentworth, GA.

Factory automation in sugar refineries[edit]
As in many other industries factory automation has been promoted heavily in sugar refineries in recent decades. The production process is generally controlled by a central process control system, which directly controls most of the machines and components. Only for certain special machines such as the centrifuges in the sugar house decentralized PLCs are used for security reasons.[1]

The raw sugar is stored in large warehouses and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with heavy syrup and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the affination process.
Screening[edit]
The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup (about 70 percent by weight solids), which is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide that combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they are skimmed off.
After any remaining solids are filtered out, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or, in more modern plants, ion-exchange resin.

The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized under vacuum to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging. To produce granulated sugar, in which the individual sugar grains do not clump together, sugar must be dried.
Sugar drying and storage[edit]
Drying is accomplished first by drying the sugar in a hot rotary dryer, and then by blowing cool air through Centrifugal Blower/fan it for several days in so-called conditioning silos. The finished product is stored in large concrete or steel silos. It is shipped in bulk, big bags or 25 – 50 kg bags to industrial customers or packed in consumer-size packages to retailers.
The dried sugar must be handled with caution, as sugar dust explosions are possible. For example, a sugar dust explosion which led to 13 fatalities was the 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion in Port Wentworth, GA.

Factory automation in sugar refineries[edit]
As in many other industries factory automation has been promoted heavily in sugar refineries in recent decades. The production process is generally controlled by a central process control system, which directly controls most of the machines and components. Only for certain special machines such as the centrifuges in the sugar house decentralized PLCs are used for security reasons.[1]

Sugar refinery in Arabi, Louisiana, United States.






Sugar refinery in Groningen, The Netherlands


A sugar refinery is a refinery which processes raw sugar into white refined sugar or that processes sugar beet to refined sugar.
Many cane sugar mills produce raw sugar, which is sugar that still contains molasses, giving it more colour (and impurities) than the white sugar which is normally consumed in households and used as an ingredient in soft drinks and foods. While cane sugar does not need refining to be palatable, sugar from sugar beet is almost always refined to remove the strong, almost always unwanted, taste of beets from it. The refined sugar produced is more than 99 percent pure sucrose.
Whereas many sugar mills only operate during a limited time of the year during the cane harvesting period, many cane sugar refineries work the whole year round. Sugar beet refineries tend to have shorter periods when they process beet but may store intermediate product and process that in the off-season.
Raw sugar is either processed into white refined sugar in local refineries, and sold to the local industry and consumers, or it is exported and refined in the country of destination. Sugar refineries are often located in heavy sugar-consuming regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Since the 1990s many state-of-the art sugar refineries have been built in the Middle East and North Africa region, e.g. in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Algeria. The world´s largest sugar refinery company is American Sugar Refining with facilities in North America and Europe.

Raw sugar processing[edit]
Affination[edit]




Raw sugar storage in a sugar refinery


The raw sugar is stored in large warehouses and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with heavy syrup and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the affination process.
Screening[edit]
The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup (about 70 percent by weight solids), which is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide that combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they are skimmed off.
After any remaining solids are filtered out, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or, in more modern plants, ion-exchange resin.
Sugar house[edit]

The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized under vacuum to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging.

SKIL - Sugar Refining






How Sugar is Refined - the Basic Story
Raw sugar is made in tropical countries where sugar cane can be grown profitably.  It is then shipped in bulk to a refinery in the country where the sugar is required.  It now has to be finally cleaned up, purified and made ready for the consumer.


It helps to think of refining as a series of steps from left to right where colour and non-sugars are concentrating to the left and pure sugar is concentrating to the right.  However the raw sugar comes into the process to the left of centre, not at one end.  In the description that follows the flow of sugar is followed first and then the remainder of the process is reviewed.

AffinationThe first stage of processing the raw sugar is to soften and then remove the layer of mother liquor surrounding the crystals with a process called "affination".  The raw sugar is mixed with a warm, concentrated syrup of slightly higher purity than the syrup layer so that it will not dissolve the crystals.  The resulting magma is centrifuged to separate the crystals from the syrup thus removing the greater part of the impurities from the input sugar and leaving the crystals ready for dissolving before further treatment.

The liquor which results from dissolving the washed crystals still contains some colour, fine particles, gums and resins and other non-sugars.


CarbonatationThe first stage of processing the liquor is aimed at removing the solids which make the liquor turbid.  Coincidentally some of the colour is removed too.  One of the two common processing techniques is known as carbonatation where small clumps of chalk are grown in the juice.  The clumps, as they form, collect a lot of the non-sugars so that by filtering out the chalk one also takes out the non-sugars.  Once this is done, the sugar liquor is now ready for decolourisation.  The other technique, phosphatation, is chemically similar but uses phosphate rather than carbonate formation.


DecolourisationThere are also two common methods of colour removal in refineries, both relying on absorption techniques with the liquor being pumped through columns of medium.
One option open to the refiner is to use granular activated carbon [GAC] which removes most colour but little else.  The carbon is regenerated in a hot kiln where the colour is burnt off from the carbon.  The other option is to use an ion exchange resin which removes less colour than GAC but also removes some of the inorganics present.  The resin is regenerated chemically which gives rise to large quantities of unpleasant liquid effluents.

The clear, lightly coloured liquor is now ready for crystallisation except that it is a little too dilute for optimum energy consumption in the refinery.  It is therefore evaporated prior to going to the crystallisation pan.


Boiling
In the pan even more water is boiled off until conditions are right for sugar crystals to grow.  You may have done something like this at school but probably not with sugar because it is difficult to get the crystals to grow well.  In the factory the workers throw in some sugar dust to initiate crystal formation.  Once the crystals have grown the resulting mixture of crystals and mother liquor is spun in centrifuges to separate the two, rather like washing is spin dried.  The crystals are then given a final dry with hot air before being packed and/or stored ready for despatch.


Recovery
The liquor left over from the preparation of white sugar and the washings from the affination stage both contain sugar which it is economic to recover.  They are therefore sent to the recovery house which operates rather like a raw sugar factory, aiming to make a sugar with a quality comparable to the washed raws after the affination stage. As with the other sugar processes, one cannot get all of the sugar out of the liquor and therefore there is a sweet by-product made: refiners' molasses.  This is usually turned into a cattle food or is sent to a distillery where alcohol is made.
