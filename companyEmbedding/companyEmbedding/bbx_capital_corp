                IT'SUGAR was acquired by BBX Capital Corp.            

                Brett Drury            








 



BBX Capital Corp. has made its biggest purchase yet in the candy business with the $57 million acquisition of a majority stake in IT'SUGAR.
The Fort Lauderdale-based company (OTCBB: BBXT) has previously snapped up Hoffman’s Chocolates, Anastasia Confections, Droga Chocolates, Williams & Bennett, Helen Grace Chocolates and Kencraft Confections to give it a portfolio of sweet businesses.

                            IT'SUGAR was acquired by BBX Capital Corp.                        
Brett Drury










 


Now that list is headlined by Deerfield Beach-based IT'SUGAR, which has 95 stores in 26 states and Washington, D.C. In the 12 months ended April 30, the candy seller had net revenues of $78.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million, BBX said.




BBX said that its candy subsidiary should have revenue of $110 million to $115 million in 2017 on a pro-forma basis. However, the acquisition of IT'SUGAR is not expected to generate net income in the short term, the company said.
BBX said it now owns 93 percent of IT'SUGAR, so founder and CEO Jeff Rubin will retain his job and a “meaningful” membership interest. He founded the company in 2006.
"We are pleased to announce our investment in IT'SUGAR and believe the business is an excellent fit with the growth strategy of BBX Sweet Holdings," commented Jarett Levan, president of BBX Capital. “IT'SUGAR has had great success expanding its presence across the United States as a modern day candy playground, and we are very pleased to partner with Jeff Rubin and the IT'SUGAR management team to support continued expansion of its retail footprint and grow the brand in other channels."




 


BBX worked with Stifel as executive advisor on the deal. Other investments by BBX include real estate, timeshare developer Bluegreen Corp, home furnishing manufacturer Renin Corp., and a MOD Pizza franchise.
