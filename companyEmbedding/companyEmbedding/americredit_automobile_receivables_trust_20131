      Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-2
    





April 01, 2013 09:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 
      2013-2:
    

      --$214,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$382,800,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,800,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$84,170,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$104,490,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,750,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,290,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-2 is consistent 
      with 2013-1 and 2012 transactions. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac 
      Corp. (FICO) score is 566, and WA internal credit score is 240. Used 
      cars total 56.7% and WA loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 110%, all 
      consistent with recent pools.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with the last four transactions. The reserve is 2.00% 
      (non-declining) and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance), growing to a target of 14.25% of the current 
      pool balance, less the reserve.
    

      Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      portfolio and 2009 - 2012 AMCAR securitizations have declined to some of 
      the lowest levels ever seen, supported by the gradual economic recovery 
      and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook, and 
      GM Financial 'BB' with a Positive Watch. GM Financial recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010, and the overall health of GM has 
      also improved.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and 
      securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately 
      servicing this series.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce CNL levels higher than the base 
      case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss 
      coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain 
      note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending 
      on the extent of the decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch conducts 
      sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case CNL 
      assumption by 1.5x and 2.5x and examining the rating implications on all 
      classes of issued notes. The 1.5x and 2.5x increases of the base case 
      CNL represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.
