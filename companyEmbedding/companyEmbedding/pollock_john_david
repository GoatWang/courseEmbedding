We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Pollock has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for West Virginia.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Pollock's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

                                            Josh was a good friend! He was my first best true friend. I meet Josh when I was in kindergarten When Josh moved to Texas I thought that I would never see him again, but I was so wrong . He promised me that we would stay in touch and we did. When he would come home for his visits, he would go to his grandparents ( The Pollocks ) I would go stay with him or he would come to my house and stay .I always looked forward to seeing him. Josh I am so Proud of You . My heart goes out to your whole family. I miss you very much  Thank You for being a True Friend!!

Words will never take away the hurt that you feel now. We never expect to lose one of our children, but sometimes GOD does have a different plan. It was a pleasure for me to be part of Josh's life. Watching him develop from a care free teenager into a young man was a blessing to me. I was also overjoyed when Josh decided to join the US Army and be a protecter and guardian of our Freedom. Josh is looking down upon us now saying, don't cry, be happy, be brave and I'll see you soon.

                                            God ordains and chooses the government and the military for a high and noble purpose.  The man who chooses to enter its ranks, whether he knows it or not, is serving more than his country; he's serving God.  Even before entering the military, God had a plan and purpose for the lives of these men.  Though we can't understand why God's plan had to include these tragedies, we know He is sovereign.  The actions of each of these men demonstrated a mental toughness, courage, and, ultimately, sacrifice.  These are personality traits of  men being made in the image of God. God is the source of all heroism, the bulwark of all courage, the foundation of all sacrifice.  These men were each born with these characteristics and they carried them out to the end.  It is the mettle of these men, and others in our military, that helps to make our country the greatest nation in the world...

--Fervently, diligent Soldier, that's, my, name 

Dignity's quality, I display, all aflame

I wear, the USA sealed sleeve patch, without claim to fame

I will fight to the end, without shame  

If in combat, I should die, do not grieve and do not cry

Just know that, for my sacrifices, I will live on, in God's platoon, in the sky

My heart pour's out to you in this time of hurt. It make's you wonder why God chose to take Josh at such a young age, someone who was truly there to make a difference in our Country. Unfortunately God has chosen for Josh to make a difference up above instead. I know he made you proud, as you did him. So very sorry for your loss of a dearly loved Son and Brother. Your family remain's in my prayer's as you try to heal in this difficult time.

When I heard about Josh my eyes filled with tears, as they are now, having a twenty year old daughter I can feel your pain. I truly believe that Josh is still watching over you to make sure that his Mom still has "everything she needs".  My heart breaks for your loss.

Flagpoles stand at half; the banner flies stoutly with the wind." "A Cavalry Soldier stepped off a "Winged Horse" today. Troopers stand with heels pressed taut ... adorned with glazed eyes. Flattened hands pushed temple tight, for one's last combat flight." "A Cavalry soldier died today, with honor forged on infinity's wall. Long vanished Cavaliers proudly join the final charge, So remembrance could speak the name ... for eternity's present roll-call." Josh, Although we have only served together for a short time, you have disgtinguished yourself by your great desire to surpass the standard and excell at all that you learned, accomplished, and your continued love for being a soldier and NCO never accepting defeat, never quiting, and never once meeting a stranger, you treat all people with the same respect and thoughtfullness, caring, compassion that only some can claim to, never forgeting that all people are kindred and of god. I am sure along with your name being record in the book of life, your good deeds shall outweigh any bad that you have done. We shall all share a final formation in Heaven one day and I will be proud once again to stand beside you and to see a fellow brother again, we will continue to serve for ertenity in Gods Cavalry and share a drink once again at fiddlers Green. the time that we have deployed to serve the great people of our beloved Nation and the Great State of Texas was an honor for me and  I want you to know you will never be forgotten my fellow Scout.

We are so sorry for the loss of Josh.  Allow God to comfort you through this difficult time and receive His strength and hope to deal with this loss.  John 14:18-I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.  Believe that and let our Lord's comfort overflow to you.
Love you all,

Tim and Margie Chesney

                                            I met Josh last summer in Washington CH at his grandparent's house, Don and Virginia Pollock.  I am their "backyard neighbor".  Josh was a friendly, outgoing, funny, and helpful young man.  He really enjoyed the company of his grandparents and working with his grandpa on the farm.  He loved the county fair.  I didn't know him long, but enjoyed knowing him.

                                            Caring, loving thoughts go out to you at this difficult time.  Words can not express our sincere sympathy for your loss.  May God's love sustain you all.
Love,
