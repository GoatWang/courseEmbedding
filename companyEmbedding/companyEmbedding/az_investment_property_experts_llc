I am an admitted skeptic. I do not easily trust other people with our money. I have been won over by IPX. My husband and I attended some events, a nuts and bolts meeting, looked at some properties, and asked many questions. We are now investors! No matter what stage of the process or who we were dealing with, the level of courtesy and professionalism has been remarkable. But even more important to me has been the level of disclosure that this company offers. They are open and upfront with their customers at every level of the process. If you have a question they are willing to discuss it with you- no secrets, no hidden agendas. I am so pleased that we found IPX!
David and Nona Rowland

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Why this investor is ready to buy more turnkey rental properties




“I currently own one property that is producing good income on a regular basis. We are scheduled to sell it to the tenant this summer. I also am involved with the self-directed IRA/401K program and have established my own LLC to continue to invest in the Phoenix up and coming Real Estate market. IPX and its staff kept me informed on issues regarding my investments. They are always prompt, courteous and thorough. Everyone who is looking to invest in this market should look at opportunities with IPX. I plan on being involved with this company for a long time to come. “
Kristopher Lodge, IPX Investors“I have been listening to IPX on the radio and like the complete, turnkey real estate process that IPX provides. We recently purchased a home and a trust deed with IPX and that went smoothly. I have had many questions throughout our meetings and they have been answered to my satisfaction. I am very pleased to be associated with this company. This is a great opportunity for great returns with minimal risk as compared to standard equity investments.”
Robert & Erma Bergland, IPX InvestorsDaniel Butterfield  CEO & Owner, Investment Property ExpertsDaniel is the founder of Investment Property Experts, an innovative company for being the only turnkey, full-service, real estate investment solution provider in Arizona.   

Daniel brings a unique combination of professional skills to helping investors achieve their retirement dreams.  After earning a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, Daniel began his career as a design engineer at NASA's Johnson Space Center.  Later he worked at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) where he integrated software and redesigned business processes for Fortune 500 companies.  

In his early 20s, while still working long hours in the corporate world, Daniel started investing in real estate.  He bought 17 properties in less than two years.  After making his first million, he switched career paths to real estate investing.  His experience as a detailed-oriented engineer and strategic thinker for large corporations served as the foundation for creating IPX.

Daniel is a visionary in Arizona’s unique real estate environment.  In 1997, he identified opportunities in distressed asset investments and focused on residential real estate investments with built-in exit strategies.  In late 2011, thanks to his analytical skills and proprietary tools, he anticipated the turning of real estate pricing before others, giving his clients a first-mover advantage.  Today, he leads the IPX team in offering top-notch brokerage services, renovation, property management, financing, accounting services and more.

I am an admitted skeptic. I do not easily trust other people with our money. I have been won over by IPX. My husband and I attended some events, a nuts and bolts meeting, looked at some properties, and asked many questions. We are now investors! No matter what stage of the process or who we were dealing with, the level of courtesy and professionalism has been remarkable. But even more important to me has been the level of disclosure that this company offers. They are open and upfront with their customers at every level of the process. If you have a question they are willing to discuss it with you- no secrets, no hidden agendas. I am so pleased that we found IPX!
