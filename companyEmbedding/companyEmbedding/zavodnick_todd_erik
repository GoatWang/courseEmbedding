Todd Erik Zavodnick's Experience
Title: President International
               Company: Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc
Job Details
               ZELTIQ® Aesthetics, Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. ZELTIQ's first commercial product, the CoolSculpting system, is designed to selectively reduce unwanted fat that may not respond to diet or exercise. The CoolSculpting procedure is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. It utilizes patented technology of precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis. ZELTIQ developed the CoolSculpting procedure to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer.
Title: Board Member
               Company: NovaBay Pharmaceuticals Inc

Cases We Handle




Car Accidents
 
Car accident injuries have numerous long-term consequences. An injury lawyer may help minimize the financial hardships they create.





Truck Accidents
 
18-wheelers are among the largest vehicles on the road, and accidents involving them have the potential to be especially devastating.





Nursing Home Abuse
 
Nursing homes are given the great responsibility of taking care of vulnerable individuals. Caretaker abuse of patients is inexcusable.





Motorcycle Accidents
 
Because of the limited safety motorcycles offer, accidents involving riders have an additional degree of risk other accidents lack.





Dangerous Drugs
 
Pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to create safe products, but sometimes drugs have dangerous undisclosed side effects.





Premises Liability
 
When you're on another person's property, you can reasonably expect to be safe. Unaddressed hazards can cause guests to get unduly hurt.





Product Liability
 
If you've been injured by a dangerous product, it is possible to hold its manufacturer accountable for malfunctions or design defects.





Construction Accidents
 
Construction sites are inherently dangerous workplaces, but that is all the more reason for them to strictly adhere to safety laws.





Traumatic Brain Injuries
 
Sustaining a brain injury can alter a person’s identity or completely eliminate their independence. Help is available for victims.





Wrongful Death
 
When a loved one is suddenly killed as a result of someone's negligence, it is difficult to know how to respond amidst the pain and grief.





DUI Accidents
 
If you've been hurt by a drunk driver, you may be able to seek compensation for the completely preventable injuries you've had to endure.





Workers' Compensation
 
Workplace injuries are typically covered by workers' compensation insurance, but sometimes perfectly valid claims are unfairly denied.

Personal Injury
Accidental injuries happen without warning and often have devastating consequences. We all have a standard responsibility not to harm others. When there is a breach in that responsibility and someone else sustains an injury as a result, the injured party has a right to seek compensation for the costs associated with the injury. Oftentimes, insurance companies will handle compensation in these cases. Victims of car accidents, for example, will often receive sufficient monetary coverage. Sometimes the insurance coverage is inadequate for the costs associated with the injury. When this happens, it may be more prudent to consider a lawsuit.

Work Injuries in Philadelphia | Zavodnick, Zavodnick & Lasky, LLC | (215) 875-7030






If you have been hurt at work, give us a call today and schedule your free consultation to discuss how we can help you to begin to put your life back together.

There is limited time to file a claim, so taking action quickly can help you avoid running into problems. It will also help your case to file while the accident is still fresh in your mind. Additionally, the sooner you make your claim, the sooner you could be eligible to receive compensation. If you are curious to know what your case might be worth, be sure to visit our personal injury calculator page.
Know that you do not need to live with the consequences of another person’s irresponsible actions. If you were hurt because of someone else’s negligence, either due to unsafe driving, dangerous property conditions, or defective products, help is available.
