Corporate Finance Strategy


An ‘isthmus’ is a narrow land bridge surrounded by water, connecting two larger bodies of land. Isthmus Partners connects our clients to the world.
                            Isthmus Partners is a corporate financial strategy consultancy for private companies, providing guidance at critical junctures in a business life cycle (start-up, growth, change of ownership, new business development, restructuring, new business or finance strategies). We work closely with private company owners and managers, and facilitate decision making on complex corporate financial strategy issues. We also work with institutional investors on their portfolio companies and target companies.
                            We have extensive hands-on experience in financial due diligence and in developing customised financial models.

                                In December 2015 Isthmus Partners entered into a collaboration agreement with Tanto Capital Partners, an investment firm focusing on global opportunities across the capital structure primarily within the emerging market space and high growth sectors. See our Collaborators page for more info on Tanto Capital Partners.

Isthmus Partners under strict confidentiality will help you analyze the situation and propose solutions, and help put those solutions in place.Through our sister company Isthmus Project Development Consultants (www.ipdc.ae) we can provide project development consultancy services.
Isthmus Partners is owned and run by two principals and we are business owners of other ventures.

Meet the Team
 







Our Team
The Isthmus Partners team is composed of highly experienced professionals across Advisory Services, Investment Management, Client Services and Operations.
 








 







Our History
 













Our History
Founding partners David A. Hackworthy, Victor E. Rodriguez, Frank J. Gambino, CFA and Joel C. McNeil, CFP® have worked together since 2003. In 2014, they founded Isthmus Partners as an independent asset management firm. The origins of Isthmus Partners client assets date back 75 years. Built on honesty and integrity, we have applied the same high quality core investment tenets for over three generations.
Our company name is both a geographical reference and an expression of our purpose. An isthmus is a strip of land connecting two larger land areas, usually with water on either side. Madison, Wisconsin—built on the isthmus that connects lakes Mendota and Monona—is one of only two major U.S. cities built on an isthmus.
We adopted the name because we’re proud of our city and for the symbolism of our partnership with clients to provide peace of mind and to connect them with their financial goals.



  







Guiding Principles
 







 







Commitment in our vision.Consistent in our pursuit.
Isthmus Partners has the expertise and resources to provide comprehensive financial solutions for individuals, families, institutions and financial advisors.
From our headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin, we serve a growing network of clients who value our autonomous approach to asset management that provides sound strategies, personal service and collaborative relationships.
Patience, discipline and a perspective rooted in the fundamentals are all critical to meeting our clients' goals. At Isthmus Partners, our core beliefs guide our investment decisions.
Equity Guiding Principles

Valuation and quality must always factor into an investment manager's decision-making process.
Great companies do not always constitute great investment opportunities; so we seek out attractively priced companies that have consistently created economic value for shareholders, which often include companies with improving quality characteristics.
There is no substitute for independently assessing a company's valuation and future growth prospects.
The outcome of independent research may involve going against the consensus. Investment practitioners have a perpetual obligation to evaluate the risks and merits of going against the crowd.
