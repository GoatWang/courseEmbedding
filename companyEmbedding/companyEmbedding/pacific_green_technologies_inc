ENVI-Marine™

ENVI-Marine™ is a highly efficient seawater scrubbing system for marine exhaust gases.













ENVI-Marine™ is a seawater scrubbing system that uses the patented ENVI-Clean™ scrubbing head to provide a highly interactive turbulent zone between seawater and the marine exhaust gases.
The turbulent zone provides the energy and residence time to remove SO2 and a significant portion of particulate matter in a compact and flexible footprint. The International Maritime Organisation and European Community have established harmonized regulations in Sulphur Emission Control Areas that require lower sulphur emissions as can be delivered by the ENVI-Marine™ seawater scrubbing system.









Technical Description



The ENVI-Marine™ system has three areas of interaction – the quench zone, the patented turbulent scrubbing head and the pack bed media.
The system functions by:

Using the natural alkalinity of seawater to absorb SO2 emissions produced by marine engines
Post treatment discharge of neutralized sulphur into sea
Using caustic soda (NaOH) as a supplemental reagent when transiting areas with low seawater alkalinity

The system has a flexible layout allowing for:

Potential for component separation
Able to configure footprint to fit space available
Compact footprint

	 


ESTIMATED PAYBACK ON CAPITAL COST
Aframax - 310 days
Suezmax - 285 day




 


System Operating Modes
The ENVI-Marine™ system is designed to operate in three modes, Open, Closed and Hybrid depending on the sea’s alkalinity and the effluent emission regulations of the waters in which the ship is located.
Open Mode – single pass raw seawater.  Seawater returned to sea following treatment.
Closed Mode – water is recirculated with NaOH added to neutralize sulphur. No discharge while in port. Solution is processed and contaminants are stored for disposal ashore.
Hybrid Mode –  NaOH is added to segments of open system to maintain SO2 removal efficiency in areas of low alkalinity.
Removal efficiency is directly related to thoroughness of interaction and residence time of exhaust gas and seawater.

ENVI-Pure™

Designed to remove a broader range of contaminants with very high efficiency as required by Waste to Energy (WtE) and Biomass power plants.













The ENVI-Pure™ system is a refined version of the ENVI-Clean™ system which has been designed to remove a broader range of contaminants with very high efficiency as required by Waste to Energy (WtE) and Biomass power plants.
The ENVI-Pure™ Emission System combines the ENVI-Clean™ highly effective wet scrubbing technology with an innovative wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) and a granular activated carbon absorber to remove particulate matter, acid gases, regulated metals, dioxins and VOCs from the flue gas to levels significantly below those required by strictest international regulations.
With further reductions pending, ENVI-Pure™ offers a long-term solution for use within the Waste to Energy industry.









Technical Description



The ENVI-Pure™ system can be designed to remove up to 99.99% of targeted species from waste combustion. Because of its modular approach, ENVI-Pure™ provides a level of future proofing unavailable to date within the marketplace.

Enhanced approach to pollutant removal captures particulate matter, acid gases, regulated metals, dioxins and VOCs in a single pass system,
Reagent management control system minimizes the use of consumables to significantly reduce operating costs,
Design allows the flue gas to transit the entire cross-sectional area of the scrubber resulting in a smaller footprint and lower capital cost,
Scrubber footprint can be adjusted to fit the space available making the system an ideal candidate for retrofit applications,
Non- hazardous waste water can be processed and reused within the system or for other plant processes such as ash cooling or waste input moisture control,
Multicyclone, turbulent wet scrubber and WESP combine to remove particulate to detection limits insuring capacity to meet future regulations with today’s system,
Acid gases are virtually eliminated,
Activated carbon removes dioxins, VOCs and vapor phase mercury to levels significantly less than the most restrictive regulations.

Each combustor/boiler needs to be equipped with its own air pollution abatement system to reduce particulate emission concentrations at the stack to below regional and national air quality standards such as:

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- USA
Waste Incineration Directive aka (WID/IPPC) allowable limits for particulate, acid gases and other regulated combustion by-products. -- UK and EU




 


Acid Gases: The ENVI-Pure™ system with its multi-head turbulent scrubber provides more contact time for more complete removal of acid gases.  Costs are controlled by using lower cost reagents on the first head while polishing to greater than 99% efficiency on the second head with more reactive reagents.
Particulate: The use of a multicyclone, turbulent wet scrubber and WESP in combination provides particulate removal to detection limits.  The ENVI-Pure™ system meets tomorrow’s stricter limits today.
Water Use and Waste: The ENVI-Pure™ system produces sludge and wastewater that can be used in various ways;

Wastewater is suited for ash quenching/cooling and feed moisture conditioning,
After dewatering the sludge is suitable for landfill, non-structural concrete stabilization products or combination with bottom ash.

Typical equipment for an ENVI-Pure™ system includes the following major components:

a multi-cyclone for coarse particulate removal
an induced draft (ID) fan to provide the flow and pressure boost
a gas conditioning chamber (GCC) for cooling and conditioning of the flue gas
a wet scrubber with two heads for highly-interactive turbulent scrubbing of particulate and acid gases
a wet ESP for removal of fine particulate to low levels
Activated carbon adsorber for VOC, dioxin and vapor phase mercury removal

The scrubbers are serviced by a lime slurry tank, lime storage silo and controlled mixing equipment with the required pumping and distribution.










Pacific Green Technologies are leading a revolutionary change to industrial emissions control across a number of industrialised countries.

ENVI-Marine™

ENVI-Marine™ is a highly efficient seawater scrubbing system for marine exhaust gases.













ENVI-Marine™ is a seawater scrubbing system that uses the patented ENVI-Clean™ scrubbing head to provide a highly interactive turbulent zone between seawater and the marine exhaust gases.
The turbulent zone provides the energy and residence time to remove SO2 and a significant portion of particulate matter in a compact and flexible footprint. The International Maritime Organisation and European Community have established harmonized regulations in Sulphur Emission Control Areas that require lower sulphur emissions as can be delivered by the ENVI-Marine™ seawater scrubbing system.









Technical Description



The ENVI-Marine™ system has three areas of interaction – the quench zone, the patented turbulent scrubbing head and the pack bed media.
The system functions by:

Using the natural alkalinity of seawater to absorb SO2 emissions produced by marine engines
Post treatment discharge of neutralized sulphur into sea
Using caustic soda (NaOH) as a supplemental reagent when transiting areas with low seawater alkalinity

The system has a flexible layout allowing for:

Potential for component separation
Able to configure footprint to fit space available
Compact footprint

	 


ESTIMATED PAYBACK ON CAPITAL COST
Aframax - 310 days
Suezmax - 285 day




 


System Operating Modes
The ENVI-Marine™ system is designed to operate in three modes, Open, Closed and Hybrid depending on the sea’s alkalinity and the effluent emission regulations of the waters in which the ship is located.
Open Mode – single pass raw seawater.  Seawater returned to sea following treatment.
Closed Mode – water is recirculated with NaOH added to neutralize sulphur. No discharge while in port. Solution is processed and contaminants are stored for disposal ashore.
Hybrid Mode –  NaOH is added to segments of open system to maintain SO2 removal efficiency in areas of low alkalinity.
Removal efficiency is directly related to thoroughness of interaction and residence time of exhaust gas and seawater.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pacific Green Technologies (OTCMKTS:PGTK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
