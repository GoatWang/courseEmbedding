Genesis Energy, L.P. Announces Changes in Ownership and Board of 
      Directors






October 09, 2012 12:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Genesis Energy, L.P. (NYSE: GEL) announced that certain members 
      of the Davison family of Ruston, Louisiana have made a third substantial 
      investment in the partnership. The Davison family led an investor group 
      that acquired 2,165,002 Class A common units (or 2.7% of those 
      outstanding) and 34,998 Class B common units (or 87.5% of those 
      outstanding) in a private placement from the Quintana Capital Group--a 
      Houston-based private equity fund--and certain of its affiliates and 
      co-investors. That transaction, which closed on Friday, October 5, 2012, 
      resulted in certain members of the Davison family, collectively, owning 
      approximately 17.2% of the partnership’s outstanding Class A units and 
      76.9% of the partnership’s outstanding Class B units, which entitle the 
      Davisons to elect at least a majority of the members of the board of 
      directors of the partnership’s general partner. Messrs. James E. 
      Davison, Sr. and James E. Davison, Jr. have been on our board since 
      2007. The Davison investor group also included three other continuing 
      members of our board--Mrs. Sharilyn Gasaway and Messrs. Corbin J. 
      Robertson, III and Grant E. Sims, who also is our Chief Executive 
      Officer.
    

      Chief Executive Officer Grant E. Sims said, “We continue to be honored 
      and inspired by the Davison’s confidence in, and commitment to, us and 
      our growth potential. They have a long and profitable history of 
      investing in and building successful enterprises, including the 
      partnership. Over the last five years, James and Jim have been an 
      important part of a stabilizing force that has allowed us to focus on 
      executing our strategy. We value their support and input.”
    

      James E. Davison Sr., the leader of several energy businesses that today 
      represent a large portion of the partnership’s core assets, stated, “We 
      are excited to have the opportunity to make another substantial 
      investment in the partnership. We have the highest level of confidence 
      in the integrity, capability and ingenuity of the partnership’s 
      management team. We believe that this management team can continue to 
      foster an enabling culture that will allow the partnership to move 
      quickly and profitably to the next level.”
    

      Pursuant to the private placement referenced above and a contemporaneous 
      underwritten offering, the Quintana private equity funds (along with 
      their affiliates and co-investors) monetized substantially all of their 
      remaining investment in the partnership. In connection with Quintana’s 
      monetization of its remaining interest in the partnership, the following 
      directors appointed by Quintana and its co-investors resigned from our 
      board—Robert C. Sturdivant, William K. Robertson, Carl A. Thomason and 
      S. James Nelson. The board subsequently designated Grant E. Sims as 
      Chairman of the board and Kenneth M. Jastrow II as Lead Independent 
      Director.
    

      Mr. Sims stated, “The Quintana funds’ initial investment in Genesis was 
      a transformational event. It re-energized our management team and 
      eventually allowed us to align the interests of our common unitholders 
      with the interests of the equity holders of our general partner, which 
      alignment was fully realized when we consummated our IDR simplification 
      at the end of 2010. I would like to thank the resigning directors for 
      their time, patience and other contributions to the partnership as we 
      evolved into a more viable participant in the midstream sector. And, I 
      would like to express a special appreciation to Corbin Robertson, Jr., 
      who leads the Quintana funds and related entities. His vision and 
      willingness to invest in our management team facilitated our success. 
      Today, we have the personnel, scale, financial condition and strategic 
      footprint that should allow us to continue on our growth trajectory.”
    

      Genesis Energy, L.P. is a diversified midstream energy master limited 
      partnership headquartered in Houston, Texas. Genesis’ operations include 
      pipeline transportation, refinery services and supply and logistics. The 
      Pipeline Transportation Division is engaged in the pipeline 
      transportation of crude oil and carbon dioxide. The Refinery Services 
      Division primarily processes sour gas streams to remove sulfur at 
      refining operations. The Supply and Logistics Division is engaged in the 
      transportation, storage and supply and marketing of energy products, 
      including crude oil, refined products, and certain industrial gases. 
      Genesis’ operations are primarily located in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, 
      Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.
    

      This press release includes forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of 
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although we believe that our 
      expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no 
      assurance that our goals will be achieved, including statements 
      regarding closing of the transaction. Actual results may vary 
      materially. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statement.

Comments:
Cpl James E. Davison, radio operator of the C-47 42-101025, took off from station 464 in Merryfield, UK to drop 18 paratroopers over DZ-D as part of Operation Albany during the Normandy invasion. Their target time was 0134. Their plane was the last of five waves to cross the Cotentin, over air defenses now on full alert. To complicate matters, there were heavy clouds at 1500 feet, gone unreported due to the strict radio silence. Some pilots decided to pull up and find their DZs with the Eureka-Rebecca system, others went low to obtain a visual of their DZs, and a rare few stayed the course through the cloud bank. While approaching their drop, the plane came under heavy flak fire. It exploded in mid-air at 0142.
