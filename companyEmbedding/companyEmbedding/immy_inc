IMMY's VR/AR Glasses Incorporate Natural Eye Optics™ Technology
TROY, Michigan, March 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IMMY Inc., a leading developer of for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, announced today that it has been granted a revolutionary optical design patent from the U.S. Patent Office for its Natural Eye Optics™ technology to power next generation immersive computing products.  
IMMY's patent is for a revolutionary lens-less imaging system called Natural Eye Optics™ (NEO). It replicates how humans see in the real world, providing the most natural and comfortable viewing experience possible. The IMMY optical system is a direct retinal projection optic unlike any other technology. In the IMMY, the light rays travel only through air, never entering another medium, alleviating eye strain. In all other technologies, the light rays travel through refractive lenses, diffractive elements, waveguides, or holographic elements, all of which introduce distortions and aberrations that can induce eyestrain and headaches. 
Natural Eye Optics™ is considered the Holy Grail of optics for the AR & VR product sector and was thought to be impossible to accomplish. It has taken IMMY Inc. ten years to perfect the NEO™ technology, which enables a large Field of View (FoV), as much as 135 degrees, delivers the most natural and compelling viewing experiences for both VR and AR, and can be produced in a compact, lightweight package. 
The U.S. Patent Office approved IMMY's foundational Natural Eye Optics™ system with the issuing of U.S. Patent No. 9,250,444 on Feb. 2, 2016. IMMY was also issued patents in Japan and Mexico. Additional supporting and utility patents have been issued for the device's structural frame, the micro display alignment, the non-pupil forming optical path and the assembly mechanism. Other international patents are pending. 
"IMMY has succeeded in creating a unique set of optic innovations and design alternatives for VR/AR that can deliver outstanding immersive virtual reality and augmented reality experiences," said Doug Magyari, IMMY Inc. Founder and CEO. "The IMMY technology is designed to enable multiple near-to-eye VR/AR products. We are pleased that the U.S., Japan, and Mexico Patent Offices have acknowledged this groundbreaking technology."
About IMMY Inc.:
IMMY is the creator of the safest, most technologically advanced, VR/AR glasses in the industry. The IMMY NEO™ delivers fully immersive and natural 3D virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences that will forever change the way people live, learn, work and entertain.

The Power to Empower











Company"IMMY creates technology that empowers andenables people to transform their lives."IMMY is a group of dedicated individuals that have designed and developed, from the ground up, the most important communication tool ever developed.    More than two decades ago we started working in the nascent field of Immersive Training. This required unique methods of communicating to the brain - all three brains; the conscious brain, the sub-conscious brain and the autonomic brain.  We began as users of Head Mounted Display's (HMD), putting thousands of people through immersive training.  The HMD's were the weak link in the process - so we set out to fix the weak link and build our own.  Starting with human physiology and an understanding of the eye and the visual cortex as the central primary criteria driving every design decision, we created the IMMY Mark I™.Eye Safety, Eye Comfort, Human Safety and Human Comfort should be the top line drivers for anyone building HMD's and Smartglasses.  At IMMY, these are the cornerstones that drive every decision.  IMMY is fortunate to have highly accomplished, passionate and dedicated team members with a unified goal of delivering the next major computing platform.  The IMMY optics team helped build the James Webb Telescope, and also specialized in building optic systems for defense.  Our software team comes from decades of developing leading edge software systems, which specialize in VR, AR, and UX interfaces.  Our Electronic Designers have incorporated the latest MEM's technologies, sensors, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication technologies.  Our Product Designers and Human Factors Engineers come from multiple disciplines and have designed many of the products you see and enjoy every day.  Our Manufacturing Team comes from the Midwest where millions of products are built every day.  Simply put...the IMMY team is unmatched in the industry.Everyone at IMMY is passionate and dedicated to building the most important and powerful communication tool ever devised.  Doug Magyari, CEO











TechIn 2005, the IMMY team recognized that in order to deliver a breakthrough wearable display device, it needed to develop a new class of optical technology.  After 10 years of pioneering development by some of the brightest minds in optics, metrology, and high precision optics manufacturing, IMMY has accomplished what was thought to be impossible.  IMMY has deveoped the worlds first, and only, lens-less imaging optic, the Natural Eye Optic™ (N.E.O).  The N.E.O. Replicates the human vision system, providing the most natural and comfortable viewing experience possible.  IMMY’s N.E.O. technology eliminates the limitations of existing optics technologies, thus delivering a large FoV, 3D AR/VR capability in a lightweight, wearable and mobile form-factor at an affordable price. In order to deliver a product platform that unlocks the power of immersive computing for the mass market IMMY developed additional breakthroughs in electro-chromics, user interface and software.  IMMY is ushering in the new era of mobile immersive computing with the IMMY Mark I™. NATURAL EYE OPTICS (N.E.O.)In the real world there's only air between the image you see and your eyes, no prisms, no lenses, no light guides...just air.  For any wearable display to offer a comfortable viewing experience it must deliver the images to the relaxed eye.  This is especially true to deliver a truly immersive, connected and emotional 2D/3D experience.  The IMMY NEO is powered by a unique, advanced optic technology that works like natural human vision.







FIELD OF VIEWThe difference between "Looking" and "Experiencing" is largelydetermined by the Field Of View.  The IMMY Mark I™ has a 60 degree FOV!

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
