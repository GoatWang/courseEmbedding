                                    Our weapon simulation technology is built into all US fighter planes.                                


Our weapon simulation technology established and remains the standard for real-time weapons assessment. This capability used on air combat training ranges world-wide has expanded from strictly training to the tactical world through our Zone Acquisition Program (ZAP). ZAP has been integrated into the Operational Flight Program of every US fighter plane to provide pilots a highly accurate understanding of the weapon’s capabilities. ZAP was a revolutionary leap in capability to the US warfighter, replacing low-fidelity coefficient driven algorithms, with accurate high-speed simulations.

A Note from our CEO
Thank you for your support of Arotech. In 2016, we continued the transformation of our corporate cost structure, and the commitment we have made to improving shareholder returns. The streamlining efforts we began in 2015 were continued during 2016. We exit 2016 as a much leaner company, and are ready to capitalize on our many promising endeavors. 
We were able to improve our bottom line from continuing operations in 2016, despite a 3.7% downturn in revenues during the year. This was the result of cost cutting and segment margin improvement in our Simulation Division.
We have a great capability set at Arotech, which is owing to our talented and dedicated staff. The promising developments at both our Training and Simulation Division and our Power Systems Division should lead to a bright future for Arotech. I look forward to better top and bottom line results and building a stronger backlog of orders as we realize in 2017 the results of the hard work we put in last year.
Once again, thank you for your support.
