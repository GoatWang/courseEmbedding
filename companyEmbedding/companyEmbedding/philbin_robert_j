Job Details
               Lawyers Escrow Service, Inc. ("LES"), www.lawyersescrow.com, is an independent, full-service provider of comprehensive services in connection with real estate transactions of all kinds. LES has operated continuously since 1975 in Nashville, Tennessee, providing services for real estate transactions in Davidson and surrounding counties. LES is widely known and respected in the real estate community of Davidson and surrounding counties for its independent professionalism, confidence and integrity, and is a trusted service provider for many builders, lenders, real estate firms, agents and brokers, and other real estate professionals. Specifically, LES is a certified trusted provider for Stewart Title Guaranty Company ("Stewart"), making extensive use of Stewart's world-class technology tools to provide services that are compliant with RESPA and CFPB regulations and in accordance with the American Land Title Association's best practices. LES' staff of 8 full-time and 1 part-time employees is highly experienced and competent in all phases of real estate transaction services, having over 100 years of combined experience. LES was owned by the Members of the law firm of Taylor, Philbin, Pigue, Marchetti & Bennett and its predecessors from 1975 to 1998. In 1998 LES was transferred to the sole ownership of Michael J.

Mr. Philbin had been the supervising Member for LES from its formation until his succession to sole ownership. He was one of the pre-eminent practitioners of real estate law in Nashville.

Shannon is an experienced real estate closing professional with over 15 years of experience who has served LES as Senior Closing Coordinator, a role she will continue to fulfill as well as becoming Chief Executive Officer of LES. In 2015 Denny Bennett, a former law partner of Mr. Philbin and a lawyer with a uniquely diverse array of legal and business experience (see LES attorney bios), joined Michael J. Philbin P. C. as of counsel and LES as staff counsel. Following the death of Mr. Philbin, Mr. Bennett acquired Michael J. Philbin, P. C. along with fellow attorney S.
