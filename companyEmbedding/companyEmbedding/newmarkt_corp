Comfort bike







 
 





Kids bike










Cycling is not only a lot of fun, it also connects people and fosters relationships - children love to explore the outdoors on bikes with their parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends. The magic of biking is that it puts the entire family in motion - little bikers often encourage adults to get up and moving, too.





The comfort bikes are built mainly for leisurely, recreational riding and short distance jaunts on bike paths or paved roads with flat terrain. They can be used for easy dirt trails but are best for errands, rides around town or family outings.

Home•About NewMarket



 


 Through the years, our values have remained the same. 
Today’s NewMarket Corporation is a far cry from its beginnings in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company. As the world has evolved, so have we. And now we’re recognized worldwide as the well-balanced holding company for some of the most respected and successful companies within the petroleum additives industry.
 
Much of our success and expansion over the last century is owed to adding new industry-leading solutions and growing our base of customers. But another large part has come from strategic acquisitions.
 
Against the background of a changing global economy, this combination has helped us gain a worldwide reputation for delivering value to our customers and equity to our shareholders.
 
Today, NewMarket Corporation provides strategic guidance and insight for our family of companies. By leveraging our centralized resources, our family of companies are able to respond quickly to local market conditions and specific customer needs.
 
While our business has certainly evolved since we manufactured paper products over a century ago, the way we operate remains unchanged. Everyone we deal with -- employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and communities – can feel confident that NewMarket and its people act with honesty, integrity, and fairness.

(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering.
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.

(2) Includes travel costs to trade shows and exhibits.


We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small
independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions and
decreased demand for our bicycles and Segways renting out service. We will be at
a competitive disadvantage in obtaining the facilities, employees, financing and
other resources fulfill the demands by prospective customers. Our opportunity to
obtain customers may be limited by our financial resources and other assets. We
expect to be less able than our larger competitors to cope with generally
increasing costs and expenses of doing business.


Company Description
On July 17, 2015, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada. We are engaged in business of renting out bicycles and Segways.
---

Newmarkt Corp. represents itself as bicycle and Segways renting out company. We
are offering such service to touristic companies at the moment


 where tourists,
friends, families can organize, plan, develop their own unique vacation on bikes
and Segways for along time, just for a day or for a couple of hours.

We are in the early stages of developing our growing plan to offer a rent
bicycle service in Lithuania. We believe that the fact that the city of Vilnius,
where we are starting our business, is popular among tourists gives the Company
more opportunities to succeed.

We currently have some revenues and some operating history. The Company
currently has two major customers to work with. We expect to get another
customers and expand our service sales and our operations by the end of the
fiscal year. Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following
successful completion of our offering is to develop and establish our bicycles
renting business by establishing our second and third office, developing our
website, attempting to enter into more supply agreements with prospective
distributors and manufacturers of bicycles and Segways, engage in advertising
and marketing activities and hire personal and sales service specialist.

Newmarkt Corp. is currently in negotiations with two potential customers Trav Lt
and Around Lithuania travel agencies, which are interested in our service and we
are planning to sing service agreements with them in the very near future.   

We believe that rental bicycle has never been more in demand these days now that
gas prices are rising, and tourists would rather rent bicycles rather than cars
on a short distance of traveling. Our most obvious startup requirements for a
renting business are bicycles, Segways and safety equipment. A fleet of
thirty-three adult and twenty one children bicycles and thirty Segways we
believe are enough to start rental operation, further more we will buy
additional portion of the equipment. We consider the fact that cycling can be
dangerous and in this case we will provide our customers with helmets and safety
equipment. The Company does not maintain any liability insurance with customer
injuries while renting your equipment.

The Company is panning to expand the range of offered equipment. There will be
dual wheels self-balancing electric scooter, balancing electronic skateboards;
additional safety equipment is accordance to purchased units of equipment and
initial spare parts.
