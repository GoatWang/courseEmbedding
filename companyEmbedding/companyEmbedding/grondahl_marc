New Hampshire Business Review / August-21 2015 / Brotherly dispute may impair Planet Fitness's public offering 



Brotherly dispute may impair Planet Fitness's public offering By Bob Sanders
 


Published: August 5, 2015

The last minute disclosure of a brotherly legal dispute might mar Planet Fitness’s $200 million initial public offering that’s expected to take place on Thursday.
Michael Grondahl, who cofounded the Newington, NH company along with his brother Marc back in 1992, contacted the company via his lawyer on July 7, shortly after Planet Fitness’s intention to go public became public, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.
Michael Grondahl, the former CEO, left the company back in 2013 just after most of it was sold to TSG Consumer Partners for about half billion dollars. Marc remained with the company, along with current CEO Chris Rondeau, who joined the company back in 1993. Michael Grondahl said Wednesdays’ filing “expressed concerns with the separation agreement” when he resigned, as well as the agreement executed in October 2013 when he sold his remaining holdings. 
He also expressed the view that the non-compete clause, which expires in November 2017, “may not be enforceable” and expressed his desire to be excused from “certain indemnification obligations.” 
The company said his claims are “without merit” and intend to “vigorously contest” them, although they have initiated arbitration procedures about the sale of his stock. There is no indication that a suit was actually filed.
The company didn’t think that the dispute would have a material adverse effect on its financial results.
Neither Michael Grondahl nor the company could be reached at deadline. Rondeau is expected to give out interviews the day after the IPO, but canceled his interview with NH Business Review because of “schedule changes” before the SEC Filing.
The company also disclosed its preliminary second quarter results on the eve of the IPO.   It estimates that it will report an income between $10 or $11 million, compared to $8.5 million in the first quarter and $9 million the same quarter of 2014. Revenues for the quarter are estimated at $78 million, 24.4 percent compared to the same quarter last year. 
That’s partly because the company has more stores. It’s now up to 1,014, with the last 38 coming in this last quarter. All but one of them is franchise owned. A year ago, it had 818 stores.
Planet Fitness, which has more than 7 million members, expects the rapid expansion to continue, aiming to quadruple the number of gyms in the near further. The franchise expansion should occur mainly in the United States in the South and West and overseas, but it also could increase staffing at the company’s Newington headquarters, which currently employees about 200. 
In May, the company threatened to move its headquarters out of the Granite State unless the Legislature passed a law lowering the state tax burden on partnerships that go public. Lawmakers passed such a change, broadening it to include more businesses, but Governor Maggie Hassan vetoed it, though she offered to include some version of it in a compromise budget that would cost the state about $14 million. 
The proceeds of the IPO would mainly go to private equity firm TSG, as well as those who currently hold stock, including Rondeau and Marc Grondahl. Michal Grondahl doesn’t appear to hold any stock though some of the stores are leased to his real estate companies.   
The stock would be listed on New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “PLNT” for an estimated $14 to $16 a share.
Planet Fitness shareholders will get about ten percent of a firm that is short on cash – about $27 million – and long on debt – about a half-billion, with a capitalization estimated to be as much as $1.5 billion.

Nearly every entrepreneur strives to achieve market disruption—the kind that creates controversy, conversation and, ultimately, adoption from droves of customers.
Marc Grondahl is a master of disruption. He is co-founder of Planet Fitness, a Newington, New Hampshire-based chain of workout facilities that opened in 1992 and now has more than 650 locations nationwide and a reported 4.5 million members.
The company’s runaway success can be attributed to several factors: $10 monthly dues, free pizza on Monday nights, no group workout classes and a strict policy against lunkheads (“the stereotypical bodybuilder who drops weights loudly in the gym and creates a bad atmosphere, an intimidating atmosphere,” Grondahl explains. “When we see one of those, we sound an alarm.”)
The alarm is no joke. When a "lunk" is found traipsing around a Planet Fitness location, employees trigger ambulance-style flashing lights and screeching sirens. Bodybuilders inevitably flee in embarrassment … and usually proceed to write seething comments about the company on message boards.

The alarm is a strategic move. “We are going after the 85 percent of the population that isn’t hard-core fit,” Grondahl says. “We want people to feel comfortable and accepted here no matter what their workout level.”
Planet Fitness’ unorthodox business model is at the core of Grondahl’s advice for entrepreneurs starting out: “Just be true to yourself. If you have an idea, even if it is an unpopular idea, be tough and don’t give up. Don’t be afraid to do things differently."
Take me back to the early days. How did you get the idea to open a gym? 
Mike [Marc’s brother and co-founder] and I were about three years out of college and hated our jobs. He was working in real estate and I was doing accounting at a manufacturing company. We saw that a Gold’s Gym in Leominster, Massachusetts, was going through bankruptcy and decided to buy it. It wasn’t the right decision. We ended up getting evicted.
You got evicted from your first location? What happened? 
We didn’t have enough experience, the location was bad and it didn’t have enough parking. There were lots of problems. We went back to the drawing board and started again in 1993 with a new location, which turned out much better. At first we were Coastal Fitness. We changed the name to Planet Fitness in 1994.
What challenges did you face starting out? 
Both Mike and I second-guessed ourselves a lot in the beginning. We didn’t have much money, so we lived in our first gym for at least six months until we could afford an apartment.
Beyond that, pricing was a challenge. We started by offering memberships at $99 for a year, which was great because a lot of people would sign up, but then we wouldn’t have any guaranteed renewals for the following year. For the first five or so years, we experimented with different pricing models and went up to $35 per month. We found that people really appreciated the $10 per month price point, so we stuck with that. 
How are you able to price your memberships so low? 
It comes down to our business model. We run 24-hour gyms with 12 employees each. We don’t have salespeople, group exercise classes or child care. Everything is streamlined.
When did things start picking up for Planet Fitness? 
We had a few gyms in the early 2000s, but things really got going in 2003 when we started franchising. We started with six franchises that year and growth has exploded ever since, especially in inner city areas. We’ve done really well in places like Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. We offer an affordable, clean place for people to work out with air conditioning and flat screen TVs.
What's it like to work at Planet Fitness? 
It is a fun and collaborative environment. We have about 60 people at our corporate office and I’d say at least half of them came right from the gyms. Our VP of marketing worked at a gym desk while in college. We are really proud of our retention rates. Our main salesperson has been with us for 15 years.
We try to involve our staff in big decisions and encourage them to be part of our growth. A number of great ideas have come from our staff, including our 30-minute circuit training—a partitioned section in most Planet Fitness locations today.

How have two brothers been able to work together for so long and keep the peace? 
[Laughs] Well, it was hard in the beginning. When we started out, we were both doing the same things, which we quickly learned wasn’t going to work. We brought in consultants in the late '90s and realized that we needed to focus on our specializations. For me that was accounting; for Michael it was marketing and the creative side of the business.
I recommend other members of family businesses do the same. Make sure your roles are defined. It makes life much better.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
