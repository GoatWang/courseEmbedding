ARTICLE I - SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT
1.   PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT                                                   

  We mutually agree to transact reinsurance according to the terms of this
    Agreement. This Agreement is for indemnity reinsurance and we are the only
    two parties to the Agreement. There will be no right or legal relationship
    whatsoever between us as reinsurer and any other person having an interest
of any kind in policies reinsured under this Agreement.               

2.   EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT                                            

     This Agreement will go into effect at 12:01 A.M., January 1, 1999, and will
cover policies effective on and after that date.                      

3.   SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT                                                     

   The text of this Agreement and all Exhibits, Schedules and Amendments are
considered to be the entire agreement between us. There are no other  
  understandings or agreements between us regarding the policies reinsured
     other than as expressed in this Agreement. We may make changes or additions
   to this Agreement, but they will not be considered to be in effect unless
     they are made by means of a written amendment which has been signed by both
of us.                                                                

4.   DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT                                                  

     The duration of this Agreement will be unlimited. However, either one of us
 may terminate the Agreement at any time by giving the other ninety days
     prior written notice. We will continue to accept new reinsurance during the
ninety-day period.                                                    

Existing reinsurance will not be affected by the termination of this  
  Agreement for new reinsurance. Existing reinsurance will remain in force
until the termination or expiry of the underlying policy on which     
   reinsurance is based, as long as you continue to pay reinsurance premiums
     as shown in Article V (Reinsurance Rates and Payment). However, we will not
  be liable for any claims or premium refunds which are not reported to us
   within one hundred eighty days following the termination or expiry of the
last cession reinsured under this Agreement.

1.   AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE                                                      

We will accept automatically reinsurance of life benefits for your    
    individually underwritten ordinary life policies on any permanent resident
of the United States or Canada, in agreement with the provisions and  
limitations shown in Exhibit A (Reinsurance Coverage).                

   We will also accept automatically reinsurance of riders and supplementary
 benefits written with the covered life benefits, but only to the extent
that the riders and supplementary benefits are specifically shown in  
Exhibit A (Reinsurance Coverage), Part I.                             

You have the right to modify your retention limits shown in Exhibit A 
   (Reinsurance Coverage), Part II at any time. If your retention limits are
reduced as a result of the modification, you will need to notify us in
writing before you can cede reinsurance on the basis of the reduced   
  retention limits. We will prepare a treaty amendment which will serve as
our written approval of the reduction.                                

We reserve the right to amend the Automatic Acceptance Limits shown in
 Exhibit A (Reinsurance Coverage), Part III if you modify your retention
     limits. We also reserve the right to modify the Automatic Acceptance Limits
if you elect to participate in another arrangement or arrangements to 
secure additional automatic binding capacity.                         

    Changes in your issue limits or underwriting guidelines will be subject to
    our review. Significant changes to your underwriting guidelines which will
affect future reinsurance will be subject to our written approval.    

2.   FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE                                                    

If you wish to submit a risk not covered automatically under this     
     Agreement, or if you wish our advice on any application, you may submit and
we will consider the risk on a facultative basis.                     

3.   BASIS OF REINSURANCE                                                       

  Life reinsurance under this Agreement will be on a Yearly Renewable Term
    plan for the net amount at risk on the portion of the original policy that
is reinsured

ARTICLE III - PROCEDURES
1.   AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE                                                      

No individual notification will be necessary for placing automatic    
reinsurance. Subject to Article V (Reinsurance Rates and Payment) and 
     Exhibit B (Reinsurance Reporting Forms and Reinsurance Administration), new
    business or changes to existing reinsurance will be shown on your periodic
billing report.                                                       

2.   FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE                                                    

   You may submit to us one or more policies not covered automatically under
the Agreement, and we will consider such reinsuring such policies on a
facultative basis.                                                    

   In order to submit a policy for consideration on a facultative basis, you
   will submit to us a reinsurance application in substantially the form set
forth in Exhibit B hereto. We will review the information and promptly
notify you of whether we will reinsure such policy. If we require     
additional information, we will promptly request that you provide such
additional information.                                               

  If we agree to reinsure the policy, we will provide you an unconditional
written offer to reinsure such policy. You are not required to confirm
  acceptance of each offer at the time the offer is received, but you will
confirm acceptance of each offer and placement of the facultative     
reinsurance with us on the monthly report; provided, however, you must
confirm the acceptance no later than the termination date shown on our
 written offer, which termination date will not be less than ninety days
  after the date on which you receive the written offer. We may extend the
     termination date if you request an extension in writing and we agree to the
extension in writing.

require for proper administration of reinsurance ceded under this

1.   AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE                                                      

 Our liability for reinsurance placed automatically under this Agreement
  will begin and end simultaneously with your liability for the underlying
policy on which reinsurance is based.                                 

2.   FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE                                                    

     Our liability for facultative reinsurance will begin and end simultaneously
with your liability of the policy on which facultative reinsurance is 
    based, provided we make an unconditional written offer that is accepted in
accordance with Article III, Section 2.                               

If our offer depends on your approval of further information about the
insurability of the risk, we will have no liability unless you have   
requested and approved the information and documented your policy file
accordingly.                                                          

3.   CONDITIONAL RECEIPT LIABILITY                                              

Our liability for losses under the terms of a Conditional Receipt or  
Temporary Insurance Receipt is shown in Exhibit E (Conditional Receipt
Liability).

premiums as shown in Article V (Reinsurance Rates and Payment) and is 
subject to Article VI (Changes to the Reinsurance) and Article VII    
(Recapture).

-----------------                                                     

Reinsurance rates that you will pay us for business covered under this

For reasons relating to deficiency reserve requirements by the various
state insurance departments, the rates shown in Exhibit C cannot be   
 guaranteed for more than one year. While we anticipate that reinsurance
rates shown in Exhibit C will continue to be charged, it may become   
 necessary for us to charge a guaranteed rate that is the greater of the
   rate from Exhibit C or the corresponding statutory net premium rate based
     on the 1980 CSO Table at 4.5% interest for the applicable mortality rating.

    If the original policy is issued with interim insurance, you will pay us a
    reinsurance rate for the interim period that is the same percentage of the
first year premium that the interim period bears to twelve months. The
 rate that you pay us for the first policy year after the interim period
will be calculated on the basis of the full annual reinsurance rate.  

    Procedures and details of reinsurance rate calculation for any benefits or
riders ceded under this Agreement are shown in Exhibit C.             

  All financial transactions under this Agreement will be in United States
   dollars, unless we mutually agree to use other currencies. Specifications
 of the currencies and details of currency conversion procedures will be
shown in Exhibit C if necessary.                                      

2.   PAYMENTS                                                                   
--------                                                              

You will self-administer the periodic reporting of your statements of 
account and payments of balances due to us a shown in Exhibit B.      

Within thirty days following the end of each month during which this  
 Agreement is in effect, you will submit to us a report substantially in
the form set forth at Exhibit B hereto. The report will contain such  
additional information as we may mutually agree in writing.           

  In the event the report shows an amount due to you, we will pay you such
amount within thirty days after we receive the report.

2.   PAYMENTS - (CONTINUED)                                                     

     Your timely payment of reinsurance premiums is a condition precedent to our
continued liability. If you have not paid the balance due us by the   
   thirty-first day following the close of the reporting period, we have the
     right to give you thirty days' written notice of our intention to terminate
    the reinsurance on which the balance is due and unpaid. At the end of this
thirty-day period, our liability will automatically terminate for all 
    reinsurance on which balances remain due and unpaid, including reinsurance
 on which balances became due and unpaid during and after the thirty-day
 notice period. Even though we have terminated the reinsurance, you will
continue to be liable for the payment of unpaid balances along with   
  interest charges calculated from the due date shown above to the date of
payment. The interest rate payable will be the same that we charge for
delinquent premiums on our individual life insurance policies.        

     You may reinstate reinsurance terminated for non-payment of balances due at
 any time within sixty days of the date of termination, by paying us all
balances due and interest charged in full. However, we will have no   
liability for claims incurred between the termination date and the    
reinstatement date.                                                   

3.   TAX REIMBURSEMENTS                                                         

 Details of any reimbursement of premium taxes that you pay on behalf of
   reinsurance payments to us are shown in Exhibit C, Section VIII. (Premium
Taxes).                                                               

     We mutually agree to the following pursuant to Section 1.848-2(g)(8) of the
 Income Tax Regulation issued December 29, 1992 under Section 848 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This election will be effective
for all taxable years for which this Agreement remains in effect.     

     The terms used in this Section are defined in Regulation Section 1.848-2 in
    effect as of December 29, 1992. The term "net consideration" will refer to
     either net consideration as defined in Section 1.848-2(f) or "gross premium
    and other consideration" as defined in Section 1.848-3(b), as appropriate.

  a)  The party with the net positive consideration for this Agreement for
         each taxable year will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses
         with respect to this Agreement without regard to the General Deductions
Limitation of IRC Section 848(c)(1).

         net consideration under this Agreement each year to ensure consistency.
      We also mutually agree to exchange information otherwise required by
the Internal Revenue Service.

ARTICLE VI - CHANGES TO THE REINSURANCE 
1.   ERRORS AND OVERSIGHTS                                                      

     If either of us fail to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement
   because of an unintentional oversight or misunderstanding, the underlying
   status of this Agreement will not be changed. Both of us will be restored
to the position we would have occupied had no such oversight nor      
misunderstanding occurred.                                            

2.   MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX                                                 

If the misstatement of the age or sex of a reinsured life causes an   
     increase or reduction in the amount of insurance in your underlying policy,
    we will both share in the change in proportion to our original liabilities
at the time the policy was issued.                                    

3.   CHANGES TO THE UNDERLYING POLICY                                           

a)  All changes. If any change is made to the underlying policy, the  
      reinsurance will change accordingly. You will give us prompt written
         notification of the change, including details and the effective date of
the change.                                                   

   b)  Increases. If the amount at risk increases because of a change in the
   underlying policy, you will promptly send us copies of all papers
       relating to the change in plan. Our approval will be necessary if the
         increase causes the amount reinsured to exceed the Automatic Acceptance
        Limits shown in Exhibit A, Part III., if the policy was reinsured on a
facultative basis, or if the underwriting classification of a 
substandard risk reinsured on a facultative basis was changed.

ARTICLE VI - CHANGES TO THE REINSURANCE 
3.  CHANGES TO THE UNDERLYING POLICY - (CONTINUED)                              

c)  Extended Term and Reduced Paid-Up Insurance. If any policy reinsured
   under this Agreement converts to Extended Term Insurance or Reduced
       Paid-Up Insurance, the net amount at risk reinsured will be adjusted as
    appropriate and reinsurance will be continued in accordance with the
 provisions of the underlying policy. Reinsurance payments for the
     adjusted policy will be calculated on the basis of the original issue
      age of the insured and the duration of the original policy at the time
the adjustment became effective, i.e. point-in-scale basis.     

4.  REDUCTIONS, TERMINATIONS AND REINSTATEMENTS                                 

If any part of the underlying coverage on a life reinsured under this   
  Agreement is reduced or terminated, the amount of reinsurance will also be
   reduced or terminated to the extent that you will continue to maintain your
appropriate retention limit as shown in Exhibit A for the issue age and 
  table rating of the insured. You will not be required to assume amounts in
   excess of the retention limit that was in force when the affected policy or
policies were issued.                                                   

The total amount of the reduction of a reinsured policy will be applied 
   directly to our net amount at risk. If reinsurance on the policy was placed
   with more than one reinsurer, our net amount at risk will be reduced in the
same proportion that our initial amount of reinsurance bore to the total
initial amount reinsured in all companies.                              

If a policy reinsured under this Agreement is lapsed or terminated, the 
    reinsurance will also terminate. If additional policies on the same life are
  reinsured with us, and if the termination causes you to maintain less than
the retention limit shown in Exhibit A, the policy(ies) issued next in  
   sequence to the terminated policy will be decreased until you maintain your
 full retention on the risk. This procedure will not apply to any policies
reinsured on a facultative basis where you have not kept your full      
retention.                                                              

  You will also follow the procedures shown in the above paragraphs when the
    reduction or termination applies to a policy or policies that you have fully
   retained, and where the reduction or termination will cause you to maintain
less than your current retention for any policy or policies reinsured.

ARTICLE VI - CHANGES TO THE REINSURANCE 
4.  REDUCTIONS, TERMINATIONS AND REINSTATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)                   

  If a policy reinsured automatically lapses and is reinstated in accordance
   with your standard rules and procedures, reinsurance for the amount at risk
  effective at the time of the lapse will be reinstated automatically at the
    date of reinstatement of the policy. You will notify us of the reinstatement
on your periodic statement of account. You will send us copies of your  
reinstatement papers only upon request.                                 

  We will not need to approve reinstatement of a policy reinsured under this
Agreement on a facultative basis when:                                  

a)  you have kept your full retention on the policy; and                

   b)  the reinsured amount falls within the Automatic Acceptance Limits shown
in Exhibit A.                                                   

   Otherwise, you will need our prior review and approval for reinstatement of
   any facultative reinsurance. You will send us prompt written notice of your
intention to reinstate the policy along with copies of the reinstatement
   papers required by your standard rules and procedures. The reinsurance will
be reinstated at the same time as the policy, subject to our written    
approval of the reinstatement.                                          

You will notify us of all reinstatements on your periodic statement of  
account, and you will pay all reinsurance payments due from the date of 
  reinstatement to the date of the current statement of account, including a
   proportionate share of interest collected. Thereafter, reinsurance payments
will be in accordance with Article V. (Reinsurance Rates and Payments). 

ARTICLE VII - RECAPTURE 
1.  BASIS OF RECAPTURE                                                          

If you increase the retention limits shown in Exhibit A, you may make a 
corresponding reduction in eligible reinsurance cessions. Policies are  
eligible for recapture if:                                              

a)  you have maintained the maximum retention limit for the age and     
      mortality rating of the insured when the underlying policy was issued.
       Policies on which you retained a reduced retention or no retention will
not be eligible for recapture.

ARTICLE VII - RECAPTURE 
1.   BASIS OF RECAPTURE - (CONTINUED)                                           

b) the policy has been in force under this Agreement for the Recapture
       Period shown in Exhibit C, Section IX. The recapture period will always
       be measured from the original policy issue date. For converted policies
       the recapture period will be the greater of the recapture period in the
        original reinsurance agreement, or the recapture period in the agreement
to which the policy has converted.                              

2.   METHOD OF RECAPTURE                                                        

You will give us written notice of your intention to recapture within 
    ninety days of the effective date of your retention increase. If you elect
  to recapture at a later date, you will give us additional written notice
before you begin the recapture.                                       

    When you have given us written notice of your intent to recapture, and the
date that the recapture will begin:                                   

a) All eligible policies will be recaptured;                          

b) Reinsurance will be reduced on the next anniversary date of each   
eligible policy;                                                

  c) Reinsurance on each eligible policy will be reduced by an amount that
      will increase your retention to the current limit set forth in Exhibit
A.                                                              

   d) If there is reinsurance in force in other companies on any one insured
    life, the reduction of the reinsurance in force under this Agreement
      will be in the same proportion that the amount reinsured with us bears
to the total reinsurance on the life;                           

 e) If at the time of recapture the insured is disabled and premiums are
      being waived under any type of Disability Benefit Rider, only the life
   benefit will be recaptured. The reinsured portion of the Disability
  Benefit Rider will remain in force until the policy is returned to
       premium-paying status, at which time it will be eligible for recapture.

ARTICLE VII - RECAPTURE 
2.   METHOD OF RECAPTURE - (CONTINUED)                                          

   If you omit or overlook the recapture of any eligible policy or policies,
   our acceptance of reinsurance payments after the date the recapture would
    have taken place will not cause us to be liable for the amount of the risk
 that would have been recaptured. We will be liable only for a refund of
reinsurance payments received, without interest.                      

If your retention increase is due to your purchase by or purchase of  
   another company, or your merger, assumption or any other affiliation with
   another company, no immediate recapture will be allowed. However, you may
     recapture eligible policies once the Recapture Period set out in Exhibit C,
Section IX, has expired.                                              

ARTICLE VIII - CLAIMS 
1.   NOTICE OF CLAIM                                                            

When you receive notice that a claim has been incurred on a policy    
reinsured under this Agreement, you will submit to us a claims report 
    substantially in form set forth in Exhibit B hereto. You will also forward
copies of the death certificate and the claimant's statement, as each 
document becomes available. Copies of the application and underwriting
papers will be sent only for a claim incurred during the contestable  
   period of the policy; otherwise you will send us only the claim documents
we specifically request.                                              

2.   SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS                                                       

 We will accept your good faith decision in settling any claim except as
specified in this Article. Once we have received the proofs cited in  
   Section 1 and upon evidence of your settlement with the claimant, we will
discharge our net reinsurance liability by paying you one lump sum,   
regardless of the method of settlement you use. For the settlement of 
  Waiver of Premium Disability or other Disability Rider benefits, we will
pay you our proportional share of the gross premium waived annually.  

You will consult with us before conceding any liability or making any 
settlement with the claimant whenever the amount reinsured exceeds the
amount that you retained.

ARTICLE VIII - CLAIMS 
2. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS - (CONTINUED)                                           

 Your claim settlements will be administered in good faith, according to the
standard procedures you apply to all claims, whether reinsured or not.    

3. CONTESTABLE CLAIMS                                                           

You will immediately notify us if you intend to contest, compromise or    
litigate a claim involving reinsurance. If we prefer not to participate in
the contest, we will notify you of our decision within fifteen days of our
  receipt of all documents requested, and we will immediately pay you the full
amount of reinsurance due. Once we have paid our reinsurance liability, we
 will not be liable for legal and/or investigative expenses and we will have
  no further liability for expenses associated with the contest, compromise or
litigation.                                                               

   When we agree to participate in a contest, compromise or litigation involving
 reinsurance, you will give us a prompt notice of the beginning of any legal
   proceedings involving the contested policy. You will promptly furnish us with
   copies of all documents pertaining to a lawsuit or notice of intent to file a
lawsuit by any of the claimants or parties to the policy.                 

   We will share in the payment of legal or investigative expenses relating to a
contested claim in the same proportion as our liability bears to your     
liability. We will not reimburse expenses associated with non-reinsured   
policies.                                                                 

If your contest, compromise or litigation results in a reduction in the   
   liability of the contested policy, we will share in the reduction in the same
proportion that the amount of reinsurance bore to the amount payable under
the terms of the policy on the date of death of the insured.              

4. CLAIM EXPENSES                                                               

  We will pay our proportionate share of the following expenses arising out of
the settlement or litigation of a claim, providing that the expenses are  
reasonable.                                                               

a) investigative expenses;                                                

b) attorneys' fees;

4. CLAIM EXPENSES - (CONTINUED)                                                 

c) penalties and interest imposed automatically against you by statute and
     rising solely out of a judgment rendered against you in a suit for policy
benefits.                                                           

  d) interest paid to the claimant on death benefit proceeds according to your
  practices. Reimbursement of interest in excess of 9%, unless otherwise
dictated by local legislation, will require our approval.           

Our share of claim expenses will be in the same proportion that our       
liability bears to your liability.                                        

You will be responsible for payment of the following claim expenses, which
are not considered items of "net reinsurance liability" as referenced in  
Section 2. of this Article:                                               

a) routine administrative expenses for the home office or elsewhere,      
including your employees' salaries;                                 

b) expenses incurred in connection with any dispute or contest arising out
 of a conflict in claims of entitlement to policy proceeds or benefits
which you admit are payable.                                        

5. EXTRA CONTRACTUAL DAMAGES                                                    

We will not be liable for nor will we pay any extra contractual damages;  
including but not limited to consequential, compensatory, exemplary or    
punitive damages which are awarded against you, or which you pay          
 voluntarily, in settlement of a dispute or claim where damages were awarded
as the result of any direct or indirect act, omission or course of conduct
undertaken by you, your agents or representatives, in connection with any 
aspect of the policies reinsured under this Agreement.                    

We recognize that special circumstances may arise in which we should      
participate to the extent permitted by law in certain assessed damages.   
  These circumstances are difficult to describe or define in advance but could
include those situations in which we were an active party in the act,     
  omission or course of conduct which ultimately resulted in the assessment of
 the damages. The extent of our participation is dependent upon a good-faith
assessment of the relative culpability in each case, but all factors being
equal, the division of any such assessment would generally be in the same 
proportion of the net liability accepted by each party.

    We mutually understand and agree that the wording and interpretation of this
  Agreement is based on the usual customs and practices of the insurance and
 reinsurance industry. While we agree to act in good faith in our dealings
 with each other, it is understood and recognized that situations arise in
which we cannot reach an agreement.                                     

    In the event that any dispute cannot be resolved to our mutual satisfaction,
the dispute will first be subject to good-faith negotiation as described
below in an attempt to resolve the dispute without the need to institute
formal arbitration proceedings.                                         

2.  NEGOTIATION                                                                 

Within ten days after one of us has given the other the first written   
  notification of the specific dispute, each of us will appoint a designated
officer to attempt to resolve the dispute. The officers will meet at a  
   mutually agreeable location as early as possible and as often as necessary,
  in order to gather and furnish the other with all appropriate and relevant
 information concerning the dispute. The officers will discuss the problem
and will negotiate in good faith without the necessity of any formal    
arbitration proceedings. During the negotiation process, all reasonable 
  requests made by one officer to the other for information will be honored.
  The specific format for such discussions will be decided by the designated
officers.                                                               

    If the officers cannot resolve the dispute within thirty days of their first
meeting, we agree that we will submit the dispute to formal arbitration.
However, we may agree in writing to extend the negotiation period for an
additional thirty days.                                                 

3.  ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS                                                     

  All disputes arising under this Agreement or Amendment will be referred to
   arbitration before three disinterested arbitrators, one to be chosen by you
and one to be chosen by us, with the third selected by the two appointed
arbitrators. Each arbitrator will be a past or present officer of a life
insurance company. If either of us fails to appoint an arbitrator within
thirty days of that date the written demand for arbitration is first    
received, the other may select a second arbitrator. If the two chosen   
 arbitrators do not designate a third arbitrator within thirty days of the
   appointment of the second, either of us may request the Philadelphia office
of the American Arbitration Association to immediately select a third   
arbitrator in accordance with the requirements of this provision.       
   Arbitration under this Article will relate to all aspects of this Agreement
  and the Amendment, including its formation and execution, and will survive
the termination of the Agreement.

ARTICLE IX - ARBITRATION
3.  ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS - (CONTINUED)                                       

Arbitration proceedings will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and,
 except as otherwise provided herein, will be conducted in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
unless the arbitrators unanimously agree to a different procedure. The  
  arbitrators will interpret the Agreement in accordance with usual business
   and reinsurance practices rather than on a strict technical or legal basis.
   Upon the request of either party, the arbitrators will issue their decision
    and the basis therefore in writing. The majority decision of the arbitrators
will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be   
  entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties will each bear
their own costs but the expenses of the arbitration, including the      
arbitrators' fees, will be shared equally.                              

ARTICLE X - INSOLVENCY

1.  All reinsurance under this Agreement is payable directly to you, your       
liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, only on the basis of your  
  liability under the reinsured policies. It is understood, however, that in
    the event of your insolvency the liquidator, receiver or statutory successor
    will provide us written notice of the pendency of any claim against you on a
  reinsured policy within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the
    insolvency or other proceedings, and during the pendency of the claim we may
  investigate such and interpose at our own expense in the proceedings where
  the claim is to be adjudicated, any defense which we may deem available to
you, your liquidator, receiver or statutory successor. It is further    
 understood that any expense we incur will be chargeable, subject to court
approval, against you as part of the expense of liquidation or other    
  proceeding to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may
accrue to you by reason of the defense undertaken by us.                

2.  In the event of our insolvency, you may, at your option and with ninety days
    written notice to us and to our liquidator, receiver or statutory successor,
terminate this Agreement and recapture immediately and completely all   
reinsured policies covered under the provisions of this Agreement. The  
termination and recapture will be without penalty, regardless of the    
    duration of time that the reinsurance has been in force. The termination and
recapture will be effective upon the earlier of the following:          

a)  the date on which we are deemed insolvent; or

   b) the date on which our insolvency has been established by the Insurance
Department of the State of New York.                            

  In the event that either party is judged insolvent, any debts or credits
    due to the other party, whether matured or unmatured, under this Agreement
or any other agreement, which exist on the date of the entry of a     
     receivership or liquidator order, will be deemed mutual debts or credits as
     the case may be and will be set off and only the balance will be allowed or
paid.                                                                 

ARTICLE XI - INSPECTION OF RECORDS

1.   Either one of us will have the right at any reasonable time to inspect the 
     original papers, records, books, files or other documents relating directly
or indirectly to the reinsurance coverage under this Agreement.

 1. The policy has been submitted on a facultative, facultative obligatory
or initial inquiry basis to us or to any other reinsurer;

NOTE:                                                                           

  1. Any activity resulting from the insured having exercised a conversion
      privilege or any similar option granted under policy provisions should
   be reflected in the "Conversion Off" or "Conversion On" categories,
       rather than being reflected in the "New Business or "Lapse" categories.

        "Conversion Off" denotes policies terminated as a result of a conversion
      for which reinsurance with Phoenix Home Life will be continued under a
    new policy; "Conversion On" denotes new policies resulting from such
conversions.                                                    

        For the purposes of this Agreement, any such change will be considered a
continuation of the original policy.                            

     The combination of "Conversion Off" and "Conversion On" will normally
  net to zero for both policy count and volume in the Policy Exhibit
totals.                                                         

  2. A separate Policy Exhibit should be prepared for each Premium Summary
Report.

I.    NET AMOUNT AT RISK CALCULATION                                            

  The Net Amount at Risk in any policy year will be the difference between
   the face amount of life benefit reinsured and the total cash value, taken
to the nearest dollar, as of the policy anniversary occurring in that 
    year. When the original policy is issued on a decreasing term plan or on a
  level term plan with a duration of twenty years or less, the cash values
will be disregarded. You will maintain a level retention in all years.

II.  RATES FOR LIFE REINSURANCE                                                 

    The YRT Rates (the 1975-80 Basic Select and Ultimate Aggregate Age Nearest
Birthday Mortality Table) shown in this Exhibit are annual rates for  
   standard risks and are per $1,000 of the life benefit reinsured. You will
pay us these rates multiplied by the following percentages:           

                                                                [Download Table]

Aggregate Nonsmoker rates are to be used with plans that do not have a
Preferred Nonsmoker class. These rates are guaranteed to a maximum    
   reinsured amount of $20,000,000 per life under this Agreement. Amounts in
excess of $20,000,000 will be reinsured using rates that are mutually 
acceptable.

X.    CONVERSIONS                                                               

 For the purposes of this Agreement, and unless otherwise specifically
covered elsewhere, "conversions" will mean continuations, rollovers,
exchanges and/or internal replacements.                             

a) The rates charged for conversions to plans reinsured under this  
      Agreement will be based on the original issue age of the insured and
the current duration of the original policy at the time of the
conversion, i.e. point-in-scale basis.                        

b) Conversions from plans reinsured under this Agreement to plans   
       reinsured under other Reinsurance Agreements in force between us will
 be subject to the provisions of the other Agreements, including
   provisions covering rates, allowances and/or discounts. The rates
        charged will be based on the original issue age of the insured and the
     current duration of the original policy, i.e. point-in-scale basis.

     c) Conversions from plans reinsured under this Agreement to plans that we
         do not reinsure will remain under this Agreement. Rates charged will be
         the YRT Rates shown in this Exhibit, based on the original issue age of
       the insured and the current duration of the policy at the time of the
conversion, i.e. point-in-scale basis.                        

                                                                   Continued ...

     d) Reinsurance under the provisions of this Agreement will include coverage
        for conversions of the Step-1 Plan originally issued under Automatic YRT
     Agreement No. 729 to plans of insurance covered under this Agreement.
     Such conversions will not be subject to the twenty-five percent quota
     share set forth in Article II. For Conversions of policies originally
ceded on an automatic basis, you shall recapture at the time of 
    conversion the excess of your retention at issue on the policy being
converted up to a maximum of the lessor of:                     

i)  the full face amount of the policy; or                      
ii) your retention at the time of conversion.                   

       Premiums charges for such conversions will be the premiums set forth in
 Exhibit C, based on the original issue age of the insured and the
    current duration of the policy, i.e. point-in-scale basis. You shall
  also pay to Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company a recapture
   charge, which shall be a single premium calculated at the rates set
     forth in Exhibit C, for an amount equal to the difference between the
amount retained by you at issue and the lesser of:              

i)  the full face amount of the policy; or                      
ii) your retention at the time of recapture.                    

The recapture charge will be payable to Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Company at the time the conversion is reported.       

    At the your option, an approximation of the above calculation may be
made.                                                           

       For facultative business ceded under the provisions of Article III, you
will not recapture any insurance at the time of conversion.

CONDITIONAL RECEIPT LIABILITY 
I.  AUTOMATIC REINSURANCE                                                       

We will be liable for losses under the terms of a Conditional Receipt or
   Temporary Insurance Receipt only when the following qualifications are met:

    a)  we have reviewed your Conditional Receipt or Temporary Insurance Receipt
        Form and related procedures submitted by you to us and have consented in
writing to the use of such forms and procedures.                

b)  the risk insured under either the Conditional Receipt or Temporary  
  Insurance Receipt meets your underwriting guidelines applicable to
conditional or temporary insurance and would have qualified for 
automatic coverage under this Agreement;                        

c)  you have retained the full retention required under the Agreement   
      (except for reinsurance placed with one of the YRT Reinsurers) without
reduction for the age and table rating of the insured; and      

  d)  the amount ceded to us does not exceed the Automatic Acceptance Limits
    applicable to us set forth in Exhibit A (Reinsurance Coverage), Part
III.                                                            

   You will provide us prompt notice of any changes to the Conditional Receipt
  and Temporary Insurance Receipt forms and procedures. We have the right to
consent to or reject any such changes, but such consent will not be     
 unreasonably withheld. We will not be liable for claims under any changed
   conditional receipt or temporary insurance receipt unless we have consented
to the change in accordance with this section.                          

We will maintain copies of your Conditional Receipt or Temporary Receipt
Forms and our written consent in our Home Office.                       

II. FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE                                                     

   We will not be liable for a claim incurred under the terms of a Conditional
  Receipt or Temporary Insurance Receipt for a risk which has been submitted
to us on a facultative basis.                                           

                                                                    Continued...

(Effective January 1, 1999) 

III. FACE AMOUNT INCREASES FOR INTERSECTOR PLUS PLAN                            

1.   Any increase in the face amount of a Reinsured Policy that is an 
          Intersector Plus Policy (each, an "Intersector Plus Policy") resulting
         when premium and/or dividends with respect to such policy are used to
purchase paid-up additions ("PUA") will not be ceded to us  
        automatically but may be submitted to us on a facultative basis. PUA
       may be used to convert the term insurance portion of an Intersector
    Plus Policy to permanent insurance, in which event we will share
      proportionately in the changes in the net amount at risk resulting
from such converted permanent insurance.                    

     2.   The term insurance portion of the Intersector Plus Policy may increase
         according to a schedule determined at issue and; in the event of such
          increase, you will retain the portion of such policy equal the product
     of (a) and (b), where (a) equals the face amount of the policy in
  force (including the increase), and (b) equals a fraction, the
      numerator of which is your retention at issue with respect to such
         policy before the increase, and the denominator of which is the total

	Effective May 1, 2009 the principal underwriter and general distributor will change from Nationwide Securities, LLC to Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC").








	 



	Any and all references to Nationwide Securities, LLC (“NSLLC”) are replaced with Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC").

	 

	NISC is located at One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215.




	 



	In addition, the following changes are made effective:




	 



	The Distribution of Policies or the Sale of a Policies provision is replaced as follows:




	 



	The current distributor of the Policies is Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC") located at One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, an affiliate of NLICA.  Until May 1, 2009, the Policies were distributed by Nationwide Securities, LLC (“NSLLC”) (formerly, 1717 Capital Management Company), located at
	One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of NLICA.



	 



	The Policies were sold on a continuous basis until December 31, 2008 by licensed insurance agents in those states where the Policies could lawfully be sold. Beginning January 1, 2009 no new policies will be sold, but agents may continue to accept additional premium on existing Policies.  Agents are registered representatives of broker
	dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are member firms of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").



	 



	Gross first year commissions paid by NLICA on the sale of these Policies provided by NISC are approximately 91% of the target premium plus 2% of any excess premium payments.  We pay gross renewal commissions in years 2 through 10 on the sale of the Policies provided by NISC that will not exceed 2% of actual premium payment, and will
	be 0% in

	policy years 11 and thereafter.  Expense allowances and bonuses may also be paid, and firms may receive annual renewal compensation of up to 0.25% of the unloaned Policy Account Value.



	 



	NISC received no compensation as principal underwriter of variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts offered by insurance company subsidiaries of Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. during 2008, 2007, or 2006.  NSLLC received $11,699,242, $16,493,648, and $16,865,494 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
	as principal underwriter of the Policies and of other variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts offered by NLICA and its affiliates.  However, NSLLC did not retain any of the compensation it received as principal underwriter during the past 3 fiscal years.



	 



	8.           The “Legal Proceedings” section of your prospectus is replaced with the following:






	 



	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company) was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and retirement savings operations of the
	Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), which refers to Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America (NLICA), Nationwide Life and Annuity Company of America (NLACA) and subsidiaries, including the affiliated distribution network. NFS is incorporated in Delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.



	 



	The Company is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. It is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the pending investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred
	to below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs’ claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and equitable remedies,
	which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company does not believe, based on information currently known by management, that the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse
	outcome in certain matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular period.



	 



	In recent years, life insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity pricing and sales practices. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial jury awards or settlements against life insurers other than the Company.



	 



	The financial services industry, including mutual fund, variable annuity, retirement plan, life insurance and distribution companies, has also been the subject of increasing scrutiny by regulators, legislators and the media over the past few years. Numerous regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
	and the New York State Attorney General, have commenced industry-wide investigations regarding late trading and market timing in connection with mutual funds and variable insurance contracts, and have commenced enforcement actions against some mutual fund and life insurance companies on those issues. The Company has been contacted by or received subpoenas from the SEC and the New York State Attorney General, who are investigating market timing in certain mutual funds offered in insurance products sponsored by
	the Company. The Company has cooperated with these investigations. Information requests from the New York State Attorney General and the SEC with respect to investigations into late trading and market timing were last responded to by the Company and its affiliates in December 2003 and June 2005, respectively, and no further information requests have been received with respect to these matters.



	 



	In addition, state and federal regulators and other governmental bodies have commenced investigations, proceedings or inquiries relating to compensation and bidding arrangements and possible anti-competitive activities between insurance producers and brokers and issuers of insurance products, and unsuitable sales and replacements by producers
	on behalf of the issuer. Also under investigation are compensation and revenue sharing arrangements between the issuers of variable insurance contracts and mutual funds or their affiliates, fee arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite reinsurance agreements, funding agreements issued to back medium-term note (MTN) programs, recordkeeping and retention compliance by broker/dealers, and supervision of former registered representatives. Related investigations, proceedings or inquiries
	may be commenced in the future. The Company and/or its affiliates have been contacted by or








	 




	NLACA Survivor Options Premier

	received subpoenas from state and federal regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, state securities law regulators and state attorneys general for information relating to certain of these investigations, including those relating to compensation, revenue sharing and bidding arrangements, anti-competitive activities, unsuitable sales
	or replacement practices, fee arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite reinsurance agreements, and funding agreements backing the NLIC MTN program. The Company is cooperating with regulators in connection with these inquiries and will cooperate with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) in responding to these inquiries to the extent that any inquiries encompass NMIC’s operations.



	 



	A promotional and marketing arrangement associated with the Company’s offering of a retirement plan product and related services in Alabama is under investigation by the Alabama Securities Commission. The Company currently expects that any damages paid to settle this matter will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated
	financial position. It is not possible to predict what effect, if any, the outcome of this investigation may have on the Company’s retirement plan operations with respect to promotional and marketing arrangements in general in the future.



	 



	These proceedings are expected to continue in the future and could result in legal precedents and new industry-wide legislation, rules and regulations that could significantly affect the financial services industry, including mutual fund, retirement plan, life insurance and annuity companies. These proceedings also could affect the outcome
	of one or more of the Company’s litigation matters. There can be no assurance that any such litigation or regulatory actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future.



	 



	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS), NMIC, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (NMFIC), Nationwide Corporation and the directors of NFS have been named as defendants in several class actions brought by NFS shareholders. These lawsuits arose following the announcement of the joint offer by NMIC, NMFIC and Nationwide Corporation to
	acquire all of the outstanding shares of NFS’ Class A common stock. The defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and have defended these lawsuits vigorously. On August 6, 2008, NFS and NMIC, NMFIC and Nationwide Corporation announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of NFS’ Class A common stock for $52.25 per share by Nationwide Corporation, subject to the satisfaction of specific closing conditions.
	Simultaneously, the plaintiffs and defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding for the settlement of these lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding provides, among other things, for the settlement of the lawsuits and release of the defendants and, in exchange for the release and without admitting any wrongdoing, defendant NMIC shall acknowledge that the pending lawsuits were a factor, among others, that led it to offer an increased share price in the transaction. NMIC shall agree to pay plaintiffs’
	attorneys’ fees and the costs of notifying the class members of the settlement. The memorandum of understanding is conditioned upon court approval of the proposed settlement. The court has scheduled the fairness hearing for approval of the proposed settlement for June 23, 2009. The lawsuits are pending in multiple jurisdictions and allege that the offer price was inadequate, that the process for reviewing the offer was procedurally unfair and that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties
	to the holders of the NFS Class A common stock. NFS continues to defend these lawsuits vigorously.



	 



	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. (NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide
	Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On December 2, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs claim to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the Deferred Compensation Committee, members of the Board of Control, ASEA’s directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO’s directors, officers and board members. The class
	period is from November 20, 2001, to the date of trial. In the amended class action complaint, the plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty, wantonness and breach of contract. The amended class action complaint seeks a declaratory judgment, an injunction, an appointment of an independent fiduciary to protect Plan participants, disgorgement of amounts paid, reformation of Plan documents, compensatory damages and punitive damages, plus interest, attorneys’ fees and costs and such other equitable and
	legal relief to which plaintiffs and class members may be entitled. Also, on December 2, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order requiring periodic payments made by NRS and/or NLIC to ASEA or PEBCO to be held in a trust account for the benefit of Plan participants. On December 4, 2008, the Alabama State Personnel Board and the State of Alabama by, and through the State Personnel Board, filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in intervention. On December 16,
	2008, the Companies filed their Answer. On February 4, 2009, the court provisionally agreed to add the State of Alabama, by and through the State Personnel Board as a party. NRS and NLIC continue to defend this case vigorously.

	On July 11, 2007, NLIC was named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma entitled

	Jerre Daniels-Hall and David Hamblen, Individually and on behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. National Education Association, NEA Member
	Benefits Corporation, Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Security Benefit Life Insurance Company, Security Benefit Group, Inc., Security Distributors, Inc., et. al

	. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all current or former National Education Association (NEA) members who participated in the NEA Valuebuilder 403(b) program at any time between January 1, 1991 and the present (and their heirs and/or beneficiaries). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income
	Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) by failing to prudently and loyally manage plan assets, by failing to provide complete and accurate information, by engaging in prohibited transactions, and by breaching their fiduciary duties when they failed to prevent other fiduciaries from breaching their fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks to have the defendants restore all losses to the plan, restoration of plan assets and profits to participants, disgorgement of endorsement fees, disgorgement of service fee payments,
	disgorgement of excessive fees charged to plan participants, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2008, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss. On June 19, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On October 17, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their opening brief. On December 19, 2008 the defendants filed their briefs. On January 26, 2009, the plaintiffs filed Appellants’ Reply Brief.
	NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On November 15, 2006, NFS, NLIC and NRS were named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entitled

	Kevin Beary, Sheriff of Orange County, Florida, In His Official Capacity, Individually and On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v.
	Nationwide Life Insurance Co., Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. and Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.

	The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in the United States that had variable annuity contracts with the defendants at any time during the class period, or in the alternative, all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in Florida that had variable annuity contracts with the defendants during the class period. The class period is from
	January 1, 1996 until the class notice is provided. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by arranging for and retaining service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks an accounting, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction and disgorgement or restitution of the service fee payments allegedly received by the defendants, including interest. On January 25, 2007, NFS, NLIC and NRS filed a motion to dismiss. On September 17, 2007, the Court
	granted the motion to dismiss. On October 1, 2007, the plaintiff filed a motion to vacate judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint. On September 15, 2008, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to vacate judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint. On October 15, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. NFS, NLIC and NRS continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On February 11, 2005, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Common Pleas Court, Franklin County, Ohio entitled

	Michael Carr v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. The complaint seeks recovery for breach of contract, fraud by omission, violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade
	Practices Act and unjust enrichment. The complaint also seeks unspecified compensatory damages, disgorgement of all amounts in excess of the guaranteed maximum premium and attorneys’ fees. On February 2, 2006, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on the breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The court certified a class consisting of all residents of the United States and the Virgin Islands who, during the class period, paid premiums on a modal basis to NLIC
	for term life insurance policies issued by NLIC during the class period that provide for guaranteed maximum premiums, excluding certain specified products. Excluded from the class are NLIC; any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of NLIC; all employees, officers and directors of NLIC; and any justice, judge or magistrate judge of the State of Ohio who may hear the case. The class period is from February 10, 1990 through February 2, 2006, the date the class was certified. On January 26, 2007, the plaintiff
	filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 30, 2007, NLIC filed a motion for summary judgment. On February 4, 2008, the Court granted the class’s motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claims arising from the term policies in 43 of 51 jurisdictions. The Court granted NLIC’s motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claims on all decreasing term policies. On November 7, 2008, the case was settled.



	 



	On April 13, 2004, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Circuit Court, Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County, Illinois, entitled

	Woodbury v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. NLIC removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois
	on June 1, 2004. On December 27, 2004, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and included in the multi-district proceeding entitled

	In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation

	. In response, on May 13, 2005, the plaintiff filed the first amended complaint purporting to represent, with certain exceptions, a class of all persons who held (through their ownership of an NLIC annuity or insurance
	product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested in mutual funds that included foreign securities in








	 




	NLACA Survivor Options Premier

	their portfolios and that experienced market timing or stale price trading activity. The first amended complaint purports to disclaim, with respect to market timing or stale price trading in NLIC’s annuities sub-accounts, any allegation based on NLIC’s untrue statement, failure to disclose any material fact, or usage of any manipulative
	or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with any class member’s purchases or sales of NLIC annuities or units in annuities sub-accounts. The plaintiff claims, in the alternative, that if NLIC is found with respect to market timing or stale price trading in its annuities sub-accounts, to have made any untrue statement, to have failed to disclose any material fact or to have used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, then the plaintiff purports to represent a class, with
	certain exceptions, of all persons who, prior to NLIC’s untrue statement, omission of material fact, use or employment of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, held (through their ownership of an NLIC annuity or insurance product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested in mutual funds that included foreign securities in their portfolios and that experienced market timing activity. The first amended complaint alleges common law negligence and seeks to recover damages not to exceed $75,000
	per plaintiff or class member, including all compensatory damages and costs. On June 1, 2006, the District Court granted NLIC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint. On January 30, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that dismissal. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. and
	Nationwide Life Insurance Company.

	Currently, the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint, filed March 21, 2006, purports to represent a class of qualified retirement plans under ERISA that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the
	payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. To date, the District Court has rejected the plaintiffs’ request for certification of the alleged class. On September 25, 2007, NFS’ and NLIC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint was denied. On October 12, 2007, NFS and NLIC filed their answer to the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint and amended counterclaims.
	On November 1, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss NFS’ and NLIC’s amended counterclaims. On November 15, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On February 8, 2008, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim, with the exception that it was tentatively granting the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss with respect to NFS’ and NLIC’s claim that it could recover any “disgorgement remedy” from
	plan sponsors. On April 25, 2008, NFS and NLIC filed their opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On September 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their reply to NFS’ and NLIC’s opposition to class certification. The Court has set a hearing on the class certification motion for February 27, 2009. NFS and NLIC continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' and Section 17(b) Applicants' Representations
1. NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL which is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of Accounts II, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and P-1 and VLI Accounts 2, 4, 7, and P-1. NLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of B, G, and P-A and VLI Account P-A.
2. All of the Separate Accounts are registered unit investment trusts used to issue one or more Contracts together with their respective Insurance Company. The file numbers for each Separate Account's registration under the Act and each Contract's registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) are set forth in the Application.
3. NVIT is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type, and it securities are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File Nos. 811-03213 and 002-73024). Two of these series, the NVIT—American Century NVIT Multi-Cap Value Fund and NVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (each an “NVIT Fund”), are the replacement funds (“New Funds” or “New Portfolios”) in the proposed Substitutions.Start Printed Page 66807

4. Nationwide Fund Advisors (“NFA”) currently serves as investment adviser to each of the NVIT Funds. NFA employs a subadvisory structure as part of its advisory strategy with respect to the NVIT Funds. Through an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, NVIT is exempt from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”).[1] 

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:
No.Old fundOld classNVIT New fundNew class1American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.—American Century VP Value Fund (“Old Value Fund”)Class INVIT—American Century NVIT Multi Cap Value Fund (“New Multi Cap Value Fund”)Class I2Old Value FundClass IINew Multi Cap Value FundClass II3Fidelity Variable Insurance Products (“VIP”) Fund—VIP Contrafund Portfolio (“Old Contrafund Portfolio”)Initial ClassNVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (“New Large Cap Growth Fund”)Class I4Old Contrafund PortfolioService ClassNew Large Cap Growth FundClass I5Old Contrafund PortfolioService Class 2New Large Cap Growth FundClass II6Fidelity VIP Fund—VIP Growth Opportunities Portfolio (“Old Growth Opps.

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Start Printed Page 66808Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and Start Printed Page 66809New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the Start Printed Page 66810necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio Start Printed Page 66811securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' and Section 17(b) Applicants' Representations
1. NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL which is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of Accounts II, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and P-1 and VLI Accounts 2, 4, 7, and P-1. NLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of B, G, and P-A and VLI Account P-A.
2. All of the Separate Accounts are registered unit investment trusts used to issue one or more Contracts together with their respective Insurance Company. The file numbers for each Separate Account's registration under the Act and each Contract's registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) are set forth in the Application.
3. NVIT is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type, and it securities are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File Nos. 811-03213 and 002-73024). Two of these series, the NVIT—American Century NVIT Multi-Cap Value Fund and NVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (each an “NVIT Fund”), are the replacement funds (“New Funds” or “New Portfolios”) in the proposed Substitutions.

4. Nationwide Fund Advisors (“NFA”) currently serves as investment adviser to each of the NVIT Funds. NFA employs a subadvisory structure as part of its advisory strategy with respect to the NVIT Funds. Through an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, NVIT is exempt from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”).1




1 In the Matter of Nationwide Investing Foundation, et al., 1940 Act Rel. No. 23133 (April 28, 1998) (Order), File No. 812-10764.

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management pursuant to delegated authority.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
