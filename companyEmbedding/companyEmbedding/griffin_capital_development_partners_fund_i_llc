© 2017 Griffin Capital Company, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’

© 2017 Griffin Capital Company, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’

GCEARII seeks to raise up to $2 billion of equity in its current offering.
Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC ("GB-BDC”) is a non-traded business development company sponsored and co-sponsored respectively by Griffin Capital and Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. ("Benefit Street"), the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., a leading global, private equity firm with over $40 billion in assets under advisement. We believe GB-BDC is distinguished from other non-traded BDCs due to the company’s intent to leverage the expertise and experience of Providence Equity and Benefit Street in the media and communications industries, which accounted for nearly one third of recent M&A activity – a key source of middle-market lending opportunities, as well as Benefit Street’s strong investment track record and proprietary sourcing network, and their emphasis on direct originated, non-sponsored, secured debt.
Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc. is a publicly registered, non-traded real estate investment trust. Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III is seeking to build a diverse portfolio of healthcare-related assets.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’
