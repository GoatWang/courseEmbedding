      Transaction Expands White Oak’s Investment in Asset-Based Lending 
      Platform
    





December 15, 2016 01:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--White 
      Oak Global Advisors, LLC on behalf of its institutional clients 
      (collectively “White Oak”), announced today that White Oak has expanded 
      its asset-based lending platform through the acquisition of Capital 
      Business Credit, LLC (“CBC”), a leading commercial finance company that 
      provides asset-based loans, factoring and trade finance products to 
      small and middle-market companies.
    


      As part of the transaction, White Oak acquired CBC’s existing loan 
      portfolio, which is comprised of over $300 million of assets employed, 
      and the CBC team along with its office locations in New York, Charlotte, 
      Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The CBC and White 
      Oak platform will be able to provide asset-based loans, factoring and 
      trade finance credit facilities ranging from $1-$100 million to 
      underserved middle-market companies.
    

      White Oak is pleased to welcome the senior leadership team of CBC 
      including Andrew Tananbaum, Robert Grbic, Michael Fortino and the 
      approximately 80 members of the CBC team, and believes their expertise 
      will allow White Oak to achieve further success and scale in the 
      commercial finance sectors.
    

      “The acquisition of CBC expands White Oak’s lending capabilities into 
      the significant and growing asset-based lending market while providing 
      White Oak’s investors with attractive alternative credit strategies. 
      Capitalizing on acquisitions of platforms with disciplined lending 
      practices, such as CBC, is an important component of White Oak’s overall 
      strategy,” White Oak CEO Andre Hakkak said in a statement.
    

      “This transaction with White Oak provides CBC with the capability to 
      offer a larger set of factoring and trade finance solutions and 
      products. We now have the ability to finance larger, more complex 
      transactions and the flexibility to offer our current clients a broader 
      array of offerings,” said Andrew Tananbaum of CBC. “In our nearly 30 
      years of providing asset-based and trade finance solutions, CBC has 
      focused on serving small and middle-market companies and we now have the 
      breadth and capabilities to offer our best-in-class financing products 
      to a much broader portion of the economy.”
    

      Houlihan Lokey served as an exclusive financial advisor to CBC in 
      connection with the transaction.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

					WHITE OAK ACQUIRES CAPITAL BUSINESS CREDIT
                
December 15, 2016

TRANSACTION EXPANDS WHITE OAK’S  INVESTMENT IN ASSET-BASED LENDING PLATFORM
San Francisco & New York – White Oak Global Advisors, LLC on behalf of its institutional clients (collectively “White Oak”), announced today that White Oak has expanded its asset-based lending platform through the acquisition of Capital Business Credit, LLC (“CBC”), a leading commercial finance company that provides asset-based loans, factoring and trade finance products to small and middle-market companies.
As part of the transaction, White Oak acquired CBC’s existing loan portfolio, which is comprised of over $300 million of assets employed, and the CBC team along with its office locations in New York, Charlotte, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The CBC and White Oak platform will be able to provide asset-based loans, factoring and trade finance credit facilities ranging from $1-$100 million to underserved middle-market companies.
White Oak is pleased to welcome the senior leadership team of CBC including Andrew Tananbaum, Robert Grbic, Michael Fortino and the approximately 80 members of the CBC team, and believes their expertise will allow White Oak to achieve further success and scale in the commercial finance sectors.
“The acquisition of CBC expands White Oak’s lending capabilities into the significant and growing asset-based lending market while providing White Oak’s investors with attractive alternative credit strategies. Capitalizing on acquisitions of platforms with disciplined lending practices, such as CBC, is an important component of White Oak’s overall strategy,” White Oak CEO Andre Hakkak said in a statement.
“This transaction with White Oak provides CBC with the capability to offer a larger set of factoring and trade finance solutions and products.  We now have the ability to finance larger, more complex transactions and the flexibility to offer our current clients a broader array of offerings,” said Andrew Tananbaum of CBC.  “In our nearly 30 years of providing asset-based and trade finance solutions, CBC has focused on serving small and middle-market companies and we now have the breadth and capabilities to offer our best-in-class financing products to a much broader portion of the economy.”
Houlihan Lokey served as an exclusive financial advisor to CBC in connection with the transaction.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
