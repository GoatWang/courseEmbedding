1½“ – set oven to broil, following grilling info

CA Reserve Porterhouse
Contrary to what you might have heard, the best way to determine the cooking time on a steak is by the thickness, rather than the weight.
On the Grill: 

 1¼“ – 10-12 minutes total; 8 and 3
1½“ – 14 to 15 minutes total; 9 and 5
2” – 15 to 18 minutes total; 11 and 6
2½“ – 20 minutes total; 12 and 7
3” – a neat trick for something this size; sear the steak for 2 or 3 min on each side, then stand the steak upright on the bone and close the lid of your grill for 18-20 minutes. The bone will act as a heat shield, allowing you to use the indirect heat of the grill to finish cooking the steak.

On the Stovetop: 

1¼“ – 10-12 minutes total; 8 and 3
1½“ – 14 to 15 minutes total; 9 and 5
2” – 15 to 18 minutes total; 11 and 6
2½“ – 20 minutes total; 12 and 7

Sear/Oven Finish: 

1¼“ – 2 min sear, preheated 350 for 12-15 min
1½“ – 2 min sear, preheated 350 for 15-18 min
2” – 3 min sear, preheated 350 for 18-20 min
2½“ – 3 min sear, preheated 350 for 20-22 min
3” – 3 min sear on each side, preheated 350 25-30 min

In the Oven:

1¼“ – set oven to broil, following grilling info
1½“ – set oven to broil, following grilling info
2” – preheated 400, 20-25 min
2½“ – preheated 400, 24-26 min

Midwestern

Cooking times do not different between the Midwestern and the California Reserve steaks; you’ll find the majority of steak cooking instructions under the “California Reserve” tab.
Midwestern Boneless Shortribs
Contrary to what you might have heard, the best way to determine the cooking time on a steak is by the thickness, rather than the weight.
Braising: this is the best method to go with boneless shortribs, and although time consuming, so was painting the Mona Lisa. The basic recipe to follow is to sear on both sides in a pan, then transfer to a large pot with a lid (a dutch-oven), and fill with veal/beef stock and a bit of red wine. Let the pot simmer on low heat (either on the stove or in the oven), for two to two and a half hours, until fork tender. To finish, thicken the liquid with a bit of flour or cornstarch, and you’ll have a 4-Star level sauce.


Midwestern Bone-in Shortribs
On the Grill: This is not the normal way to cook shortribs, and you’re not going to come out with a filet-tender piece of meat, but what you will end up with is an absolutely acceptable level of tenderness, and a “Holy Sh*t” level of flavor. The trick here is to back the heat off on the grill, go down to about 75% of your normal comfort level.
Braising: The basic recipe to follow here is to sear on both sides in a pan, then transfer to a large pot with a lid (a dutch-oven), and fill with veal/beef stock and a bit of red wine. Let the pot simmer on low heat (either on the stove or in the oven), for two to two and a half hours, until fork tender. To finish, thicken the liquid with a bit of flour or cornstarch, and you’ll have a 4-Star level sauce.


Midwestern Hanger Steak
On the Grill: 

 1” to 1½“ – 8 to 10 minutes total. Grilling is the best option for the Hanger, this is a cut that is has enough inherent tenderness and moisture that you can even end up overcooking it slightly and still have a good steak.

On the Stovetop: 

1” to 1½“ – 10-12 minutes on high heat

Sear/Oven Finish: 

1” to 1½“ – sear 2 to 3 minutes on both sides,  then finish in a 350 degree oven for 12-15 min

In the Oven:

Set oven to broil, cook for 10-12 min




Midwestern Marinated Pinwheeled Skirt Steak
On the Grill: 

1½“ to 2” – 18 to 20 minutes total; 12 and 8

On the Stovetop: 

1½“ to 2” – 18 to 20 minutes total; 12 and 8.

Sear/Oven Finish: 

1½“ to 2” – 3 to 4 min sear, then 350 oven for 15-20 min

In the Oven:

1½“ to 2” –  400 degrees 25-30 min




Rib Roasts (both CA and MW)
Oven:

2rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another hour and 15 minutes 
3rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another hour and 30 minutes 
4rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another hour and 45 minutes 
5rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another two hours 
 6rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another two hours and 15 minutes 
7rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another two hours and 15 minutes




Midwestern RibCap
On the Grill:

 25-30 minutes total, turning frequently

Sear/Oven Finish:

 Most popular way to do it: sear for 2 min on 3 sides, then finish in a 350 oven for 20-25 min. You want the internal temp to be at 135 on this cut. 

In the Oven:

 Preheat oven to 400, cook 40-45 min. Again, 135 internal temperature is what you want to aim for with the Ribcap.




MW Saratoga
Contrary to what you might have heard, the best way to determine the cooking time on a steak is by the thickness, rather than the weight.
On the Grill: 

 1” – 8 minutes total; 5 and 3
 1¼“ – 9 minutes total; 7 and 3
 1½“ – 14 to 15 minutes total; 10 and 4
 2” – 15 to 18 minutes total; 11 and 5
 2½“ – 20 minutes total; 12 and 8
 3” – 25 minutes total; with such a thick cut you can really get creative here, and grill on all four sides. Turn the steak in a constant direction, and go 7 minutes on the first and second side, then drop to 5 minutes for the final two sides

On the Stovetop:

 1” – 8 minutes total; 5 and 3
 1¼“ – 9 minutes total; 7 and 3
 1½“ – 14 to 15 minutes total; 10 and 4
 2” – 15 to 18 minutes total; 11 and 5
 2½“ – 20 minutes total; 12 and 8
 3” – 25 minutes total; with such a thick cut you can really get creative here, and cook on all four sides. Turn the steak in a constant direction, and go 7 minutes on the first and second side, then drop to 5 minutes for the final two sides.

Sear/Oven Finish:

 1” – 2 min sear on each side, then preheated 350 oven for 10 min
 1¼“ – 2 min sear on each side, then preheated 350 oven for 12 min
 1½“ – 2 min sear on each side, then preheated 350 oven for 15 min
 2” – 3 min sear on each side, then preheated 350 oven for 15-16 min
 2½“ – 3 min sear on each side, then preheated 350 oven for 18-20 min
 3” – 3 min sear ; sear 4 sides; preheated 350 oven for 12-15 min

In the Oven:

 1” – set oven to broil, following grilling info
 1¼“ – set oven to broil, following grilling info
 1½“ – set oven to broil, following grilling info
 2” – preheated 400, 20-25 min
 2½“ – preheated 400, 24-26 min
 3” – 3 preheated 400, 25-30 min




Saratoga Roast
Oven:

2rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another hour
3rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another hour and 15 minutes

7rib: Preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook rib for 15 to 20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and finish for another two hours





SausagesX Close
Grill:

15 minutes total (assuming a grill temp of about 500 degrees). Puncture each sausage several times with a toothpick before cooking. A good trick is to move them around a bit when first placed on the grill; this will prevent them from sticking. Turn frequently; every 2 to 3 minutes.

Stovetop:

 if you’re using a cast iron pan, pour the tiniest bit of olive oil, butter, or salt in the pan (anything to create a barrier between pan and sausage). Non-stick pans don’t need anything added. Puncture each sausage several times with a toothpick before cooking. Cook for 15 minutes at medium heat; turn frequently (every two three min). Don’t cover the pan – otherwise you’ll steam the sausages.

Oven:

Puncture each sausage several times with a toothpick before cooking. Place sausages on a wire rack, preheat oven to 400 degrees, cook for 15-20 minutes.





LambX Close

Boneless saddle
Grill: 

 though it wouldn’t be our preferred method of cook, it is do-able this way. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on an open grill on 3 sides; but stay close, it will flare. Then turn the grill heat down to about 350 degrees, close the lid, and give it another 30 minutes. Aim for 120 degrees internal temp. 

Oven:

Easiest way to go with this; simply preheat oven to 400 degrees, and cook 55-60 minutes.




Butterflied Leg
Grill: 

 15 to 20 minutes total; start with the lean side down for 12 min, then finish with 4-5 minutes on the flip side. 

Sear/Oven:

sear for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, then cook in a preheated 350 oven for 20-25 minutes.

Oven:

preheat oven to 400 degrees, cook 35-40 minutes




Traditional leg
Oven:

preheat oven to 500 degrees, cook for 15-20 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350, and go another 20-30 minutes till done.




Rack of Lamb
Grill: 

if you’re comfortable defusing a bomb, then you’ll be at home grilling a rack of lamb. An absolute terror for most, you’ll be safest sticking with the oven. 

Oven: 

preheat oven to 400 degrees, cook for 40-45 minutes

Book Description:
                                                This is the revised and expanded second edition of the hugely popular Numerical Recipes: the Art of Scientific Computing.

Review:
                                                "...an instant `classic,' a book that should be purchased and read by anyone who uses numerical methods..." American Journal of Physics"No matter what language you program in, these packages are classics, both as a textbook or reference. They are an essential and valuable addition to the academic, professional, or personal library." Internet"The new book exceeds, if possible, the excellence of its predecessor: it is about 50 percent longer and has been thoroughly updated...The bibliographical material has been considerably extended and updated...For new users, it is sufficient to say that practically every aspect of numerical analysis is covered...This monumental and classic work is beautifully produced and of literary as well as mathematical quality. It is an essential component of any serious scientific or engineering library." A. D. Booth, Computing Reviews"If you already have the first edition, will you want or need the second? The answer is a definitive yes...a book that should be on your desk (not your shelf) if you have any interest in the analysis of data or the formulation of models." Lyle W. Konigsberg, Human Biology"...the second [edition] expands the scope of coverage and continues the standard of excellence achieved in the first. If you were to have only a single book on numerical methods, this is the one I would recommend." Edmund Miller, IEEE Computational Science & Engineering"...remarkably complete...it contains many more routines than many commercial mathematics packages..." Byte"The authors are to be congratulated for providing the scientific community with a valuable resource." The Scientist"...replete with the standard spectrum of mathematically pretreated and coded/numerical routines for linear equations, matrices and arrays, curves, splines, polynomials, functions, roots, series, integrals, eigenvectors, FFT and other transforms, distributions, statistics, and on to ODE's and PDE's...such an education...is delightful..." Physics in Canada
