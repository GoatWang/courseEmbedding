What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

LOS ANGELES, April 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Baker Street Capital, L.P. ("Baker Street"), announced today that it delivered a letter to the independent members of the Board of Directors of Tix Corporation (OTCQX: TIXC). Baker Street is the largest shareholder of Tix Corporation, with current ownership of approximately 21.9% of the shares outstanding.  In the letter, Baker Street outlined its view that the Board has a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to evaluate Baker Street's offer.  We feel very strongly that such exploration should be conducted by a special committee of independent directors in a robust and full process to ensure that shareholders receive fair value.  
The full text of the letter follows:
Dear Independent Board Members,
As you know, Baker Street Capital, L.P., together with its affiliates (collectively, "Baker Street"), is the largest shareholder of Tix Corporation ("TIX" or the "Company"), owning 5,451,259 shares or approximately 21.9% of the Company's 24,856,893 outstanding shares of common stock.  
Five days ago we submitted to you a letter (the "March 30 Letter"), a copy of which is attached, which expressed our deep concern that senior management might be in the process of exploring an acquisition of the Company at less than full value.  To protect our significant investment in the Company and based upon our belief in the Company's long-term prospects our letter also included a non-binding offer, subject to certain conditions, to acquire all of the shares of common stock of TIX not currently owned by Baker Street for a minimum of $2.10 per share (the "Purchase Price") in cash.  The Purchase Price represented a premium of approximately 56.7% over TIX's closing price of $1.34 on March 30, 2011.
The March 30 Letter invited the Company to conduct a robust, full and fair sales process. We believe it is incumbent upon the Board to immediately create a special committee of independent directors to explore all strategic alternatives.  This step would also reduce concerns arising from the inherent conflict of interest in Mitchell Francis, the Company's Chairman and CEO, exploring a management-led buyout. We are adamant that any action which the Board endorses must allow for the realization by shareholders of the Company's substantial intrinsic value.
We were very disappointed that the Company's response to our non-binding proposal was to adopt a shareholder rights plan (or poison pill) without offering any explanation to shareholders and without disclosing either our offer or any actions the Company may have taken to assist Mr. Francis in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company.  The adoption of the shareholder rights plan appears to be but the latest in a series of events undertaken by this Board of Directors (the "Board") to insulate itself from accountability to the Company's shareholders.
It was our strong preference to continue to communicate privately with the Company to agree on a course of action in the best interest of all shareholders, but we feel compelled that all shareholders should understand the context of our proposal.  Accordingly, we are issuing a press release regarding this letter and the March 30 Letter.  We remind you that, as Board Members of a publicly traded Delaware corporation, it is your fiduciary responsibility to represent the best interests of all shareholders and we urge shareholders not to stand idly by if the Board, either through inaction, cronyism or neglect, fails to act in their best interest.  As Warren Buffett said in his 2003 Annual Letter to Shareholders, "fiduciaries must now decide whether their job is to work for owners or for managers." We stand ready to meet with an independent committee of the Board to discuss our proposal and the other matters outlined herein.
Very truly yours,
Vadim Perelman
The March 30 Letter:
Dear Independent Board Members,
Baker Street Capital Management, LLC, together with its affiliates (collectively, "Baker Street"), is the largest shareholder of Tix Corporation ("TIX" or the "Company"), owning 5,451,259 shares or approximately 21.9% of the Company's 24,856,893 outstanding shares of common stock. We believe that the Company is substantially undervalued and that the current market price does not reflect the Company's true value. We believe the Company should immediately commence a tender offer to repurchase shares, providing those shareholders interested with liquidity in cash for their equity in the Company and for those shareholders who wish to stay for the long term an increased ownership stake in the Company.
We are deeply troubled by indications we have that it may be management's intention to take the Company private at a small premium to the current depressed value, thereby purchasing the Company for less than full value and short-changing its shareholders. Any proposed transaction to take the Company private by management without the Company pursuing a robust and full sales process to all potential purchasers would prevent shareholders from participating in the realization of the Company's intrinsic value, strong market position, and growth prospects.  Therefore, we hereby set forth our desire to participate in any sales process and enter into formal discussions with the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") or an independent committee.  Further, since we have concerns that management may currently be seeking to take the Company private, we hereby set forth our non-binding proposal to acquire all of the shares of common stock of TIX not currently owned by Baker Street (the "Transaction") for a minimum of $2.10 per share (the "Purchase Price") in cash.  The Purchase Price represents a premium of approximately 56.7% over TIX's closing price of $1.34 on March 30, 2011. We are highly confident that with the combination of our existing ownership in TIX and the financing available to us, the Transaction will be fully financed upon execution of a definitive agreement. We would be pleased to meet with you as soon as possible to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement.
It is our intention to work with management and, following the Transaction, we expect the Company's senior management team would remain in place and to maintain the Company's valuable employee base. We also anticipate that we will continue to run the business substantially in accordance with the Company's current practice, with such changes as may be necessary to meet the long-term competitive environment and to realize our business objectives.
We are prepared to immediately commence our due diligence and believe it can be completed promptly with the Company's cooperation.  In connection with commencing our due diligence we would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company.  Additionally, to the extent our due diligence reveals a higher value for the Company we are willing to increase the Purchase Price. However, we do have concerns based on previous conversations with management that a confidentiality agreement would require us to enter into an unreasonable standstill to commence due diligence. We hope the independent directors would acknowledge that any such provision would be an obstruction designed to favor management and allow a sale of the Company to management at a discount.   
Our proposal is conditioned upon satisfactory completion of limited and confirmatory due diligence, the waiver of any Company anti-takeover provisions, obtaining all necessary consents and approvals and the execution of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement, which would include customary conditions for a transaction of this type and size.  
This letter should not be construed as a binding obligation on us unless and until a definitive agreement is entered into in a form acceptable to us and we reserve the right to withdraw, modify or otherwise change our proposal set forth herein at any time.
We expect that the Board has, or will, form a special committee of independent directors with respect to management's active and ongoing efforts to take the Company private.  We look forward to working with the special committee as soon as possible to complete a mutually acceptable transaction that we believe will benefit everyone involved.  As the largest shareholder of TIX we are committed to ensuring that all shareholders receive full and fair value.  
We expect to promptly hear back from you in the next few days to discuss how we can proceed constructively.  We are providing this letter on a private basis and we hope that discussions regarding the Transaction can be accomplished on a private basis.  If, however, the Board chooses to disregard its fiduciary obligations and refuses to engage in discussions, pursues a transaction with management without a full and fair sales process (including all potentially interested financial and strategic parties), or otherwise attempts to seek refuge behind defensive corporate roadblocks or machinations, we are willing to take our proposal directly to the Company's shareholders and reserve our right to take any and all legal action necessary to preserve shareholder value.
Very truly yours,
Vadim Perelman

Amendment No. 22 to Schedule 13D
 
This Amendment No. 22 to Schedule 13D amends and supplements
the statements on the previously filed Schedule 13D, as amended, filed by Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the “Adviser”),
Baker Bros. Advisors (GP) LLC (the “Adviser GP”), Julian C. Baker, Felix J. Baker, FBB2, LLC (“FBB2”) and
FBB3 LLC (“FBB3”). Except as supplemented herein, such statements, as heretofore amended and supplemented, remain in
full force and effect. Information given in response to each item shall be deemed incorporated by reference in all other items,
as applicable. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D, as
amended.
 
The Adviser GP is the sole general partner of the Adviser. Pursuant
to management agreements, as amended, among the Adviser, Baker Brothers Life Sciences, L.P. (“Life Sciences”) and 667,
L.P. (“667”, and together with Life Sciences, the “Funds”), and their respective general partners, the
Adviser has complete and unlimited discretion and authority with respect to the Funds’ investments and voting power over
investments.
 
Item 3.	 Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
 
Item 3 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and amended, as the case
may be, as follows:
 
The disclosure regarding the purchases in Item 5(c) below is
incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 4. Purpose of the Transaction.
 
Item 4 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the
case may be, as follows:
 
The Funds hold securities of Seattle Genetics, Inc. (the “Issuer”)
for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons or their affiliates may purchase additional securities or dispose of securities
in varying amounts and at varying times depending upon the Reporting Persons’ continuing assessments of pertinent factors,
including the availability of shares of Common Stock or other securities for purchase at particular price levels, the business
prospects of the Issuer, other business investment opportunities, economic conditions, stock market conditions, money market conditions,
the attitudes and actions of the board of directors and management of the Issuer, the availability and nature of opportunities
to dispose of shares in the Issuer and other plans and requirements of the particular entities. The Reporting Persons may discuss
items of mutual interest with the Issuer, which could include items in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Schedule 13D.
 
Depending upon their assessments of the above factors, the Reporting
Persons or their affiliates may change their present intentions as stated above and they may assess whether to make suggestions
to the management of the Issuer regarding financing, and whether to acquire additional securities of the Issuer, including shares
of Common Stock (by means of open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, exercise of some or all of the Stock Options
(as defined below), or otherwise) or to dispose of some or all of the securities of the Issuer, including shares of Common Stock,
under their control.
 
Except as otherwise disclosed herein, at the present time, the
Reporting Persons do not have any plans or proposals with respect to any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer
including, without limitation, those matters described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Item 5.	Interest in Securities
of the Issuer.
 
(a) and (b) Items 7 through 11 and 13 of each
of the cover pages of this Amendment No. 22 are incorporated herein by reference. Set forth below is the aggregate number and percentage
of shares of Common Stock directly held, as of the date hereof, by each of the following based upon 140,516,451 shares of common
stock as of July 20, 2016 as reported in the Issuer’s 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 26, 2016. Such percentage figures were
calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Adviser GP, Felix J. Baker and Julian C. Baker as principals of the Adviser GP, and the Adviser may be deemed to be beneficial
owners of securities of the Issuer directly held by the Funds, and may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote of
and the power to dispose or direct the disposition of such securities.
 
The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities
held by each of the Funds, and this Amendment No. 22 shall not be deemed an admission that the Reporting Persons are the beneficial
owners of such securities for purposes of Section 13(d) or for any other purpose, except to the extent that any such Reporting
Persons actually exercises voting or dispositive power with respect to such securities.
 
Julian C. Baker and Felix J. Baker are also
the sole managers of FBB2 and FBB3 and as such may be deemed to be beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock held by FBB2 and
FBB3 and may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote and dispose or direct the disposition of those shares.
 
Felix J. Baker is a Director of the Issuer.
In connection with his service on the Issuer’s Board, Felix J. Baker holds options to purchase Common Stock of the Issuer
(“Stock Options”), Common Stock and restricted stock units payable solely in Common Stock of the Issuer (“Restricted
Stock”) as disclosed in previous amendments to this Schedule 13D.
 
Felix J. Baker serves on the Issuer’s Board as a representative
of the Funds. The policy of the Funds and the Adviser does not permit employees of the Adviser to receive compensation for serving

Stock. The Funds are instead entitled to the pecuniary interest in the Stock Options, Common Stock and Restricted Stock.

capital of the applicable purchasing Fund. All purchase transactions were effected in the open market directly with a broker-dealer.
