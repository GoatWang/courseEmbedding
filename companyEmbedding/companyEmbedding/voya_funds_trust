View Detailed Performance






The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.



Benchmark Disclosures

S&P 500 Index
The Standard and Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index does not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, taxes or other expenses of investing. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.




Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Investing in funds that are concentrated in a smaller number of holdings poses greater risk than funds with a larger number of holdings because each investment has a greater effect on the Fund's performance. The value of a participation fluctuates with the market value of the underlying portfolio securities of the Trust. The dividend income, if any, from the portfolio securities is subject to fluctuation which in turn will affect the amounts of distributions made to participants. An investor in the Trust has no assurance against loss in a declining market, and redemption at a time when the market value of the participations is less than their cost will result in a loss to the investor.Taxation: For Federal income tax purposes, (1) the Trust will be treated as a fixed investment trust and will not be subject to Federal income tax, (2) each participant will be treated as the owner of his pro rata portion of the common stock of the corporations held by the Trust, (3) each participant will be required to include in his gross income his pro rata portion of the dividends and interest received by the Trust (including the amounts of such dividends and interest that are not distributed to participants but are used to pay the fees and expenses of the Trust), at the time such dividends and interest are received by the Trust, not at the later time such dividends and interests are distributed to participants or reinvested in additional participations, and (4) each individual participant who itemizes deductions may deduct his pro rata portion of the fees and expenses of the Trust only to the extent such amount, together with his other miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceeds 2% of his adjusted gross income. Please see the prospectus for further information.

Overview+



Why save for college? 
With the ever-rising costs of a college education, saving for your child’s tertiary education is fast becoming a fact of life. Thankfully, there are a number of investment vehicles to help you offset some of those expenses – but with the array of choices, choosing the right one can be an education in itself. Knowing the options before you decide where to invest your money can help you make the most of your child’s college years. 




A Savings Snapshot 
College savings plans are an increasingly popular way to invest in your child’s education. 529 Plans are state-sponsored and offer tax- deferred earnings and income tax-free withdrawals for a wide variety of qualified education expenses. A Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) offers similar benefits to a 529 Plan but has different income and contribution limits. Other ways to save include an UGMA/UTMA account, that can be used for the purpose of saving for college, among other things. UGMA/UTMA have no contribution limits and allow you to put away a capped amount of tax-reduced funds for your child, but gives them full control of the money once they come of age. You could also invest the money in a Trust for the Benefit of a Student – there are no contribution limits and fewer restrictions, but no tax advantages either.  




Why Voya?
Voya Investment Management helps over 140,000 people in the administration and investment management of their college savings, and the states of Wisconsin and Iowa rely on Voya to actively manage the investments in their state-sponsored 529 Plans1. This gives us a deep-rooted expertise when it comes to saving for college – expertise that you can put to work for you. Take a look at the resources in this section, and then call one of our registered financial advisors. They’ll be happy to help you plan for your child’s education.
