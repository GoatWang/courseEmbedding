OUR FIRM






















































































Our Firm
Institutional Fixed Income Market Specialists











                                        OUR FIRM | Overview
                                    
							
										Overview										
									
Founded in 1996, Northern Capital is a highly specialized institutional investment management firm singularly focused on the fixed income market.
                                     Our firm is both a registered broker-dealer and a registered investment adviser. Our position in the marketplace allows us to offer institutional investors professional asset management, trade execution, strategies and research.
We work exclusively with institutional investors. Our clients include registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, trust companies, municipal governments, banking institutions, charitable organizations, foundations, endowments, family offices, corporations and other business entities.  





                                        OUR FIRM | Our Culture
                                    
							
											Our Culture										
										

Our deep commitment to clients and their interests is not just our philosophy, it's built into our business model. We have concentrated our skills and resources on a core set of strategic priorities that puts objectivity, specialization, and value at the heart of everything we do.





OBJECTIVITY


SPECIALIZATION



VALUE








											Objectivity and Alignment of Interests
                                    	


Our conflicts of interest management practices are based on an avoidance model. We do not conduct proprietary trading. We do not distribute structured financial products or underwrite or sell from a single proprietary inventory, so our clients are not treated as a distribution channel. We are product agnostic. Our pricing is transparent.  Since we are institutional only, we do not compete for the same customers as our clients. An exception to the typical broker-dealer model, our interests are aligned with those of our clients.											












												Specialization, Teamwork and Service Optimization
                                    		


We are a narrowly focused firm with specialized expertise. Each of our clients is assigned a team of highly experienced multi-disciplinary specialists. Together, they leverage decades of collective experience in fixed income portfolio management, strategies, research and trading. This collaborative approach maximizes the flow of relevant information for optimal service.				












											Innovation and Technology
                                    	


Innovation is the engine that powers our performance. We have developed in-house proprietary technologies to source, quantify, select and analyze individual securities, portfolios and aggregate holdings. This enhances our scale and capabilities, allowing us to deliver reliable information, extensive services and compelling value.
                                                     












											Compelling Value
                                    	


Driving value through integration and innovation, our position in the market as both a broker-dealer and investment adviser allows us to integrate resources and technology functions, reducing expenses and increasing operating efficiencies. Through innovation, we have developed in-house proprietary technologies to source, quantify, select and analyze individual securities, portfolios and aggregate holdings. This enhances our scale allowing us to deliver reliable information, extensive services and compelling value.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
