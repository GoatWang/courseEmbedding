INN-108




 
Overview
Mechanism
Opportunity
Regulatory Status
 





                                    INN-108 is a novel oral small molecule therapeutic for Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Ulcerative Colitis is one of the two type of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) which plagues up to 1.4 million individuals in the US alone. More than 80% of patients present with the mild to moderate form of Ulcerative Colitis. In spite of high failure rates of 5-ASA treatment, there are few alternatives other than steroids, before patients are treated with the very expensive anti-TNF biologics (AbbVie's HUMIRA® and J&J's REMICADE&reg). With the combination of an immunomodulator (approved since 1994), INN-108 could lead to a more efficacious drug than the 5-ASA/mesalamine formations alone. 
                                


 

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

                                    For primary treatment of mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis various formulations of 5-ASA/mesalamine are used. Currently approved treatments include various brands such as Lialda® by Shire Pharmaceuticals and Asachol HD® by Allergan. Sales of 5-ASAs add up to about $2 billion in the US alone.   
                                
REGULATORY STATUS
INN-108 has successfully completed a phase 1 trial in the US in 24 subjects. INN-108 is in process of entering phase 2 trials for mild to moderate UC and an adult orphan indication.

S-MRCP (Secretin-Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)







                                    MRCP has been used for more than 20 years as a non-invasive tool for imaging pancreatic ducts. With the addition of secretin, pancreatic secretions are increased leading to significantly improved visualization of the pancreatic ducts for detection of abnormalities, including pancreatic cancer. The gold standard for pancreatic duct imaging had been ERCP, an expensive and invasive procedure with complications such as pancreatitis (3-5%), bleeding (1-2%), perforation (1%), infection (1-2%) and death (1/250). More than a half-million ERCP procedures are performed annually in the US and as the role of ERCP diminishes for screening, it will further the need for approval of secretin for S-MRCP. 
                                

                                    Secretin is a 27 amino acid long hormone which rapidly stimulates release of pancreatic secretions, thus improving visualization of the pancreatic ducts during imaging procedures. Secretin has also been tested in a variety of central nervous system conditions such as autism, though currently approved only for pancreatic function testing and imaging with ERCP. The currently marketed synthetic secretin, approved in 2004, has been on the FDA Drug Shortage List since 2012 and is not approved by the FDA or the EMEA for S-MRCP.

ULCERATIVE COLITIS




 
Background
Mechanism
Diagnosis
Treatment
Resources
 






Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is characterized as aninflammatory disorder, mainly of the colon and small intestine. Two major types of IBD exist: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
Ulcerative colitis causes long-lasting inflammation predominantly in the large intestine.  The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood.
Ulcerative colitis occurs in 35–100 people for every 100,000 in the United States or lessthan 0.1% of the population.  Approaching 1 million sufferers in the United States (2 million US/EU/Japan).  More prevalent in the Western World but increasing in Japan and South America.  One-third of patients diagnosed at 10-19 years of age.
The disease accounts for 250 million annual physician visits; 30,000 hospitalizations; and a loss of over one million workdays per year.  The onset of UC is most common between 15 and 40 years of age, with a second peakbetween 50 and 80 years of age.










Treatments





Current treatments for mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis are all reformulations of 5-ASA/mesalamine.  In spite of the high failure rates of 5-ASA treatments, 40%-50%, no innovation has occurred over the past several decades.

RALEIGH, N.C., July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel medicines for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, announced today it has submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking orphan drug designation for INN-108 as an oral therapy proposed for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis.
"Orphan drug designation would expedite our development of a therapy that we believe could bring relief to children and teenagers suffering from active ulcerative colitis," said Innovate's CEO Chris Prior, Ph.D. "There is an unmet need for an effective treatment for this disease, and INN-108 is a promising potential therapy. Our FDA submission is a major milestone toward making this therapy available."
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA provides incentives for companies developing treatments that are expected to provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and that target rare medical conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients per year. Incentives include seven-year market exclusivity, tax credits on U.S. clinical trials, fast-tracking of regulatory proceedings, and exemption from certain fees.
On July 3, 2017, Innovate announced that it has signed a definitive Merger Agreement with Monster Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq:MSDI), under which the shareholders of privately held Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. will become the majority owners of Monster Digital, Inc. Subject to shareholder approval, the combined company will advance its late-stage drug for celiac disease, which Innovate believes is a significant unmet medical need, into expected Phase 3 clinical trials.
About Ulcerative ColitisUlcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that mainly affects the large intestine, or colon. Symptoms typically include constant diarrhea mixed with blood, abdominal pain, increased bowel movements, and in severe cases, weight loss and fatigue. Children can also develop unique complications related to growth, development, nutrition, pubertal maturation, bone mineral density accretion and psychological impacts.
Though the disease can present at any age, it often begins in teenagers and young adults. Various studies estimate that there are between 13,700 and 87,600 cases of pediatric ulcerative colitis in the United States, with most of those occurring in children and teenagers aged 10 to 17.
More than 80 percent of patients have the mild to moderate form of ulcerative colitis that is currently treated with various formulations of 5-ASA, or mesalamine, a $2 billion market in the United States. Due to the high failure rates (40 to 50 percent) of 5-ASA treatments, new treatments for ulcerative colitis are needed.
About INN-108INN-108 is a novel oral small molecule comprised of two moieties, mesalamine/5-ASA, a currently approved agent for ulcerative colitis, and 4-aminophenylacetic acid (4-APAA), an immunomodulatory agent approved in Japan for rheumatoid arthritis. The two agents are covalently azo-bonded, thus only allowing their enzymatic separation in the colon. Innovate's preliminary data shows the combination could be a more efficacious drug than mesalamine/5-ASA approved treatments alone.
INN-108, which has successfully completed two Phase 1 clinical trials in the U.S. for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in both healthy adult subjects and adults with ulcerative colitis, will initiate its Phase 2 trial in 2018. A liquid oral formulation of INN-108 for ulcerative colitis is in development for greater convenience for pediatric use.
About Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
Innovate is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel autoimmune/inflammation therapeutic drugs. 
Innovate's lead drug candidate, larazotide acetate (INN-202), has successfully met its primary endpoint in an efficacy clinical trial for celiac disease. Larazotide successfully completed the End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA to prepare for expected Phase 3 clinical trials for larazotide in celiac disease in late 2017. In clinical studies in more than 800 patients, larazotide demonstrated a favorable safety profile comparable to placebo, due to what Innovate believes is its lack of systemic absorption from the small bowel. Larazotide has also received Fast Track designation from the FDA.
Larazotide, an oral peptide formulated into a capsule, has a mechanism of action which decreases intestinal permeability and regulates tight junctions by reducing antigen trafficking across epithelial cells in the intestines. Innovate believes that larazotide is the only drug in the clinic with this mechanism of action of reducing intestinal permeability. Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as "leaky gut," has been widely recognized in the literature as a gateway to multiple autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several others.
Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the clinical development of our product candidates, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks associated with the success, cost and timing of our product development activities and clinical trials; the approval and commercialization of our product candidates; and risks of increased regulatory requirements, amongst others. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Innovate Biopharmaceuticals disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Executives from Innovate Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has drug candidates entering Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials, respectively, for the treatments of celiac disease and ulcerative colitis, will be in New York Feb. 13-14, meeting with potential investors at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference. Innovate's presentation is on Monday, Feb. 13, at 2 p.m. EST in the Conrad Room at The Waldorf Astoria. 
Interested investors and licensing partners can email the company to schedule meetings: investor.relations@innovatebiopharma.com.








Innovate is a privately held, clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel autoimmune/inflammation medicines. Innovate is also developing therapeutics for unmet needs with global impact and for orphan indications.
The company's lead drug candidate for celiac disease, larazotide acetate (INN-202), begins Phase 3 clinical trials in 2017. Larazotide, a novel oral peptide, has been studied in more than 800 patients with results that consistently reduced clinical symptoms of celiac disease. Larazotide's unique mechanism of action of reducing antigen trafficking across epithelial cells makes it a promising therapeutic for multiple diseases involving "leaky tight junctions."
Innovate's second therapeutic, INN-108, enters Phase 2 trials in 2017. INN-108 is a small molecule for the treatment of an adult orphan indication and for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.  INN-108 is a prodrug that only becomes activated in the colon. An oral liquid formulation is also in development for pediatric and elderly patients. 
Licensing opportunities for these drugs are available outside the U.S.

Innovate Biopharmaceuticals Submits Orphan Drug Application to FDA  for Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Indication




















July 12, 2017 07:07 ET

 | Source: Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc






RALEIGH, N.C., July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel medicines for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, announced today it has submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking orphan drug designation for INN-108 as an oral therapy proposed for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis. “Orphan drug designation would expedite our development of a therapy that we believe could bring relief to children and teenagers suffering from active ulcerative colitis,” said Innovate’s CEO Chris Prior, Ph.D. “There is an unmet need for an effective treatment for this disease, and INN-108 is a promising potential therapy. Our FDA submission is a major milestone toward making this therapy available.” Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA provides incentives for companies developing treatments that are expected to provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and that target rare medical conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients per year. Incentives include seven-year market exclusivity, tax credits on U.S. clinical trials, fast-tracking of regulatory proceedings, and exemption from certain fees. On July 3, 2017, Innovate announced that it has signed a definitive Merger Agreement with Monster Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq:MSDI), under which the shareholders of privately held Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. will become the majority owners of Monster Digital, Inc. Subject to shareholder approval, the combined company will advance its late-stage drug for celiac disease, which Innovate believes is a significant unmet medical need, into expected Phase 3 clinical trials. About Ulcerative ColitisUlcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that mainly affects the large intestine, or colon. Symptoms typically include constant diarrhea mixed with blood, abdominal pain, increased bowel movements, and in severe cases, weight loss and fatigue. Children can also develop unique complications related to growth, development, nutrition, pubertal maturation, bone mineral density accretion and psychological impacts. Though the disease can present at any age, it often begins in teenagers and young adults. Various studies estimate that there are between 13,700 and 87,600 cases of pediatric ulcerative colitis in the United States, with most of those occurring in children and teenagers aged 10 to 17.

Innovate Biopharmaceuticals to present progress towards phase 3 celiac disease trials at BIO 2017 Convention

RALEIGH, N.C., June  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, a leader in developing innovative therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, will present on its phase 3 drug for celiac disease at BIO 2017 in San Diego on June 19th at 2:45pm PT in Theater 4. Innovate’s lead drug candidate, larazotide acetate (INN-202), has successfully completed the End of Phase 2 Meeting to prepare for phase 3 clinical trials for larazotide in celiac disease later this year. Larazotide is the only drug which has successfully met its primary endpoint in an efficacy clinical trial for celiac disease. Larazotide has received Fast Track designation from the FDA. In clinical studies in more than 800 patients, larazotide has demonstrated a highly favorable safety profile comparable to placebo, due to its lack of systemic absorption from the gut. Larazotide is a novel oral peptide with a unique mechanism of action (MOA) which decreases intestinal permeability and regulates tight junctions by reducing antigen trafficking across epithelial cells in the intestines. Larazotide is the only drug, to our knowledge, in the clinic with this unique MOA. Increased intestinal permeability has been recognized as a gateway to multiple autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several others. About Celiac Disease Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, affects 3 million people in the United States and approximately 15 million individuals worldwide. People with celiac disease who are exposed to gluten experience an immune reaction in their small intestines, causing damage to the inner surface (villi) of the small intestine, and an inability to absorb certain nutrients. Signs and symptoms of celiac disease include intestinal pain, bloating, diarrhea and failure to thrive (infants and small children). These symptoms can be reduced, and sometimes eliminated, by avoiding food that contains gluten. However, many patients remain symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet, and these patients may benefit from the addition of pharmacotherapy. Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies available to treat celiac disease.  PipelineInnovate’s second therapeutic, INN-108, is expected to enter phase 2 trials in early 2018. INN-108, a small molecule prodrug that only becomes activated in the colon, is being developed for the treatment of an adult orphan indication and for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. An oral liquid formulation is also in development for pediatric and elderly patients.

									 from   Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovate Biopharmaceuticals Inc. today announced that the company has completed an agreement to license all of Alba Therapeutics' assets relating to larazotide acetate, a tight junction regulator, progressing toward Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of celiac disease.
Larazotide acetate, now named INN-202, is a novel oral peptide that has consistently demonstrated the reduction of clinical symptoms of celiac disease in multiple clinical trials in more than 800 patients with celiac disease. The latest Phase 2b multi-center clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of larazotide acetate in 342 patients with celiac disease. Larazotide acetate has the potential to become the first approved medicine to treat celiac disease and has been granted "Fast Track" designation from the FDA.  INN-202 will begin Phase 3 clinical trials in late 2016.
"We are pleased to complete the agreement with Alba and are tremendously excited to start the final development of larazotide acetate for celiac disease, a high unmet medical need because the symptoms are painful and socially debilitating despite being on a gluten free diet," said Chris Prior, Ph.D., CEO of Innovate.
"For the past ten years, Alba has been working diligently to research and develop larazotide acetate for patients who have celiac disease. The celiac disease patient community and their gastroenterology physicians have been instrumental to the success of our research and work in this field.  We are so excited to reach an agreement with Innovate which focuses on gastrointestinal product development and thrilled they will continue the ongoing research for patients with celiac disease," said Wendy Perrow, MBA, CEO of Alba.
"There is a huge demand for adjunctive therapies from the celiac patient community, and I am happy to see larazotide acetate moving ahead with what will be the first Phase 3 trials ever conducted in celiac disease," said Daniel A. Leffler, M.D., director of research, The Celiac Center at BIDMC, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
The agreement includes up-front and milestone payments, but financial terms were not disclosed.
The larazotide acetate license expands Innovate's pipeline of gastrointestinal drug candidates. Other products in clinical development include Phase 2-ready INN-108, indicated for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and a GI orphan disease.  
About Larazotide Acetate and Celiac Disease
Larazotide acetate is a novel agent that belongs to a new class of drugs called tight junction regulators. Tight junctions, which are located in the bowel, should remain closed except to shed dead cells. However, in patients with celiac disease, the presence of gluten causes the tight junctions to remain open, thus starting an inflammatory cascade within the bowel that eventually destroys the intestinal villa. Early research suggests larazotide acetate may help keep the tight junctions closed when ingested prior to a meal, thus reducing the inflammatory process in response to gluten.  
Celiac disease affects 3 million people in the United States and approximately 15 million individuals worldwide. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, which is primarily found in bread, pasta, cookies, pizza crust and other foods containing wheat, barley or rye. People with celiac disease who are exposed to gluten experience an immune reaction in their small intestines, causing damage to the inner surface (villi) of the small intestine, and an inability to absorb certain nutrients. Signs and symptoms of celiac disease include intestinal pain, bloating, diarrhea and failure to thrive (infants and small children). These symptoms can be reduced, and sometimes eliminated, by avoiding food that contains gluten. However, many patients remain symptomatic despite a gluten-free diet, and these patients may benefit from the addition of pharmacotherapy. Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies available to treat celiac disease.  
About Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
Innovate is a privately held, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel gastroenterology medicines. With the addition of larazotide acetate, INN-202, a Phase 3-ready drug with fast track designation for celiac disease, an unmet need, Innovate expands it clinical pipeline. Innovate's other late stage therapeutic, INN-108, indicated for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and a GI orphan disease, is entering Phase 2 trials. INN-108 is a prodrug that only becomes activated in the colon and the convenience of a liquid formulation will be important to children and the aging population.

                                            Celiac disease (CeD) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders, affecting 1% of the population in the United States and Europe (3 million and 3.5 million people, respectively) and approximately 15 million individuals worldwide. CeD is emerging as a significant public health concern, as it is associated with increased co-morbidities and mortality, and has dramatically increased in prevalence during the past 50 years. Currently, there are no pharmacologic therapies available to treat this disease. The only management for CeD is to follow a gluten-free diet by eliminating foods that contain gluten. Unfortunately, the ability to maintain a strict gluten-free diet can be difficult, as many CeD patients reported being either accidentally or purposefully exposed to gluten-laden foods. For patients who do adhere to a strict gluten-free diet, up to 30 percent respond poorly. For these patients, therapeutic modalities beyond dietary modification would be beneficial.

Celiac disease  is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease of the small bowel, triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains (e.g., wheat, barley, and rye) in genetically susceptible individuals. CeD is one of the few autoimmune disorders in which all the elements of autoimmunity are understood:



The triggering environmental factor: glutenin/gliadin, the active fractions of gluten
The route of passage into the body: the mucosa of the small intestine
A close genetic association: with HLA genes (DQ2 or DQ8), and
A highly specific humoral autoimmune response: auto-antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP), and endomysium (EMA).

While previously thought to be uncommon, the prevalence of CeD is approximately 1% of the general population. The 2004 NIH consensus conference on CeD confirmed that the prevalence in the United States alone is approximately 3 million people. The number of diagnosed patients will increase dramatically during the latter half of this decade, driven by broad based educational campaigns, NIH research funding and widely available blood screens for highly specific antibodies (anti-tTG, DGP, EMA).
                                         
The disease is highly variable with many non-intestinal manifestations and is frequently characterized by some or all of the following: chronic small bowel inflammation, fatty stools and malabsorption, osteoporosis, anemia, occurrence of other autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders and gastro-intestinal cancers. Symptoms may include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, irritability, and painful skin rashes. Celiac disease patients that do not eliminate dietary gluten increase their chances of other diseases, such as concurrent autoimmune diseases and a 40-100 fold increase in gastrointestinal cancer. Celiac disease often presents with vague non-gastrointestinal symptoms. During the active phase, characteristic auto-antibodies recognizing tTG, deamidated gliadin peptides and endomysium are produced. Early in the disease, the tight junctions are opened and severe intestinal damage ensues. A biopsy of the small intestine, combined with auto-antibody and anti-tTG blood test, is the most accurate way to diagnose the illness.
There is no cure for celiac disease, and complete elimination of dietary gluten with a gluten-free diet is the only management of the disease. For most patients, strict dietary avoidance may heal the small intestine within 3 to 6 months and reduce the markers of autoimmunity (anti-tTG, DGP, and EMA). Several organizations have been formed to help patients meet the challenge of complete gluten avoidance. It is known that altered intestinal permeability (leaky gut) is a hallmark of CeD and tracks the severity of the disease.  It is likely that leaky gut is both a cause and a consequence of the disease, facilitating transport of gluten which then triggers an inflammatory process, resulting in tight junction dysfunction (leak) which can be blocked by tight junction regulation.




Mechanism



Intestinal tight junctions control the passage of large molecules such as intact proteins, particles and cells through the paracellular space. This passive transport is known as intestinal paracellular permeability, and while it accounts for only 10 percent of total protein uptake it serves as the major portal for intact protein and antigen delivery into the body. Protein entry is in close proximity to the submucosal lymphocytes, which comprise 80 percent of immunoglobulin producing cells in the human body.
Increased intestinal paracellular permeability leads to antigen presentation for processing and antibody response. Tight junctions in other organs have a similar function: the regulation of paracellular transport. In the capillary endothelia of the blood brain barrier, tight junctions are the anatomical barrier interfacing blood and CNS.
                                         
Tight junction dysfunction has been implicated in a host of disease states, including a variety of autoimmune diseases. Ischemia - reperfusion injury also appears to be associated with tight junction dysfunction, while many cytokines, bacterial toxins, infections, and drugs have also been implicated in tight junction injury or destruction.
