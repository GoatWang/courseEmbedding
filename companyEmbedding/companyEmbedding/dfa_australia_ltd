Founded in 1981, we have a long history of applying academic research to practical investing. Today, we offer a full range of equity and fixed income strategies designed to target higher expected returns. We regard the assets we manage as more than just shares in a portfolio. The money represents the savings, sacrifice, and dreams that investors have entrusted to us. We take this responsibility seriously.

An enduring belief in the
Power of  Markets









            Capital Markets Have Rewarded
            Long-Term Investors
         

         Growth of $1 AUD, Jan. 1985–Dec. 2016
         




















         In AUD. Indices are not available for direct investment. Their performance does not reflect the expenses associated with the management of an actual portfolio. Government Bills are the Bloomberg AusBond Bank Bill Index; Short-Term World Government Bonds is the Citi World Government Bond Index 1–5 Year hedged to the Australian dollar; World Equities is the MSCI World Index (gross div.); Australian Inflation is measured as changes in the Australian Consumer Price Index. Bill data is provided by Bloomberg. World Government Bond Index 1–5 Year data is provided by Citi. MSCI World Index data provided by MSCI. Inflation data is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
      










At Dimensional, our investment approach is based on a belief in markets.

Rather than relying on futile forecasting or trying to outguess others, we draw information about expected returns from the market itself—letting the collective knowledge of its millions of buyers and sellers set security prices.

Letting markets do what they do best—drive information into prices—frees us to spend time where we believe we have an advantage, namely in how we interpret the research, how we design and manage portfolios and how we service our clients. It means we take a less subjective, more systematic approach to investing—an approach we can implement consistently and investors can understand and stick with, even in challenging market environments.

The market is an effective information-processing machine. Market participants buy and sell securities millions of times per day in the world markets. The real-time information they bring helps set security prices.

 Breakthroughs in Modern Finance 








1966Efficient Market Hypothesis
 






Efficient Market Hypothesis
Eugene Fama
                  Nobel laureate, 2013
                  Professor, University of Chicago

Eugene Fama’s efficient market hypothesis marks a pivotal moment for modern finance. The essence of the argument can be described by the simple statement that security prices reflect all available information.









1973Intertemporal CAPM
 


 



Intertemporal CAPM
Robert Merton
                    Nobel laureate, 1997
                    Professor, MIT

The ICAPM set up a theoretical framework for how multiple sources of risk could arise. It expanded on the one-period CAPM model where the only priced risk was market beta.

Dimensional’s investment approach is grounded in economic theory and backed by decades of empirical research.


Our internal team of researchers works closely with leading financial economists to better understand where returns come from.


Research has shown that securities that offer higher expected returns share certain characteristics, which we call dimensions. To be considered a dimension, these characteristics must be sensible, persistent over time, pervasive across markets and cost-effective to capture.

Understanding what drives returns is the starting point. From here, we focus on fine-tuning our method of capturing them.


We structure broadly diversified portfolios that emphasise the dimensions of higher expected returns, while addressing the tradeoffs that arise when executing strategies.

Every day our portfolio managers and traders seek to balance costs against expected returns and diversification. We work for the slightest expected gain, as every incremental improvement can add up over-time.

A commitment 
TO OUR CLIENTS








The Global Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath


A key to a good long-term investment experience is being able to stay with your investment philosophy, even during tough times. During the rocky 2008–2012 period, many investors sold their equity funds. Within the Dimensional Global Firms*, equity funds had inflows throughout the period, which could suggest that in aggregate investors were prepared to withstand the market’s movements in order to pursue long-term results.


























         In USD. MSCI World Index data provided by MSCI. Dimensional Global Equity Flows include flows from all comingled funds with the exception of Balanced, Target Date, and Fixed Income  funds.  Additionally, the funds include only those with one of the following legal entities: DFA Investment Dimensions Group Inc., DFA Participating Group Trust, DFA International Group Trust, Dimensional Emerging Markets Value Fund, DFA Investment Trust Company, Dimensional Investment Group Inc., DFA Australia Trust, Dimensional Funds plc (Ireland), Dimensional Fund Advisors Canada Inc., Dimensional Funds ICVC (UK) and Dimensional Funds plc II (Ireland). A flow is any trade that is a purchase, sell, exchange purchase, exchange sell, dividend, long-term capital gain or short-term capital gain. This excludes any flows from other DFA mutual funds. Each flow is converted to USD on the trade date using WM Reuters London Close FX rates. For illustrative purposes only. 
        












Dimensional Investing is about providing a successful investment experience.


That means more than considering investment returns. It means offering peace of mind knowing that a transparent approach backed by decades of research is powering every decision.


Markets go up and they go down. The goal of Dimensional Investing is to help people be prepared, so they can stick with their plan.

At Dimensional, our investment approach is based on a belief in markets.

Rather than relying on futile forecasting or trying to outguess others, we draw information about expected returns from the market itself—letting the collective knowledge of its millions of buyers and sellers set security prices.

Letting markets do what they do best—drive information into prices—frees us to spend time where we believe we have an advantage, namely in how we interpret the research, how we design and manage portfolios, and how we service our clients. It means we take a less subjective, more systematic approach to investing—an approach we can implement consistently and investors can understand and stick with, even in challenging market environments.

Efficient Market Hypothesis
Eugene Fama
                  Nobel laureate, 2013
                  Professor, University of Chicago

Eugene Fama’s efficient market hypothesis marks a pivotal moment for modern finance. The essence of the argument can be described by the simple statement that security prices reflect all available information.









1973Intertemporal CAPM
 


 



Intertemporal CAPM
Robert Merton
                    Nobel laureate, 1997
                    Professor, MIT

Understanding what drives returns is the starting point. From here, we focus on fine-tuning our method of capturing them.


We structure broadly diversified portfolios that emphasize the dimensions of higher expected returns, while addressing the tradeoffs that arise when executing portfolios.


Every day our portfolio managers and traders seek to balance costs against expected returns and diversification. We work for the slightest expected gain, as every incremental improvement can add up over time.

                 Academic models provide useful insight, but they are incomplete. It’s in the gap between reality and a model where sound judgment and experience matter.

                The Global Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath 
            

                A key to a good long-term investment experience is being able to stay with your investment philosophy, even during tough times. During the rocky 2008–2012 period, many investors sold their equity funds. Dimensional’s equity funds had inflows throughout the period, which could suggest that in aggregate investors were prepared to withstand the market’s movements in order to pursue long-term results.

Performance shown represents past performance and is not indicative of future performance. Returns for periods shorter than one year are not annualised. Returns are net of fees and costs and assume income is reinvested and are gross of tax.

The trust is not managed with the objective of achieving a particular return relative to a benchmark index. A reference index has been provided for comparison purposes only and is not intended to represent the current or targeted asset allocation.  Trust performance may differ significantly from the reference index. An index is not available for direct purchase.S&P/ASX data reproduced with the permission of S&P Index Services Australia.

        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
