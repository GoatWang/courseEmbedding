 Acorn International, Inc.




 
Associated Enterprises
  









 
Acorn International, Inc. (NYSE: ATV) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is lead by Robert W. Roche, Acorn's Co-founder, Chairman and CEO and managed by a diverse leadership team that is comprised of a mix of expatriate and local Chinese managers.
Acorn is an industry leader in direct marketing and brand merchandising in China. Over its nearly twenty-year history, since its founding in 1998, Acorn has built an unparalleled track record of developing famous consumer branded products in China, and promoting and selling these products to consumers everywhere across the entire country.
Over the course of almost two decades, Acorn has developed and sold some of China’s best-known and trusted household branded products beloved by consumers across China. With few exceptions, everyone in China knows Acorn's most famous brands – and many use and love Acorn’s most famous products.
Acorn is a truly international company in China. It is built upon a strong local Chinese culture and outlook, on one hand, and it also continues to be led by its American founder Robert W. Roche, who, along with directors and top management, brings international expertise and best practices to Acorn. In this vein, Acorn takes what is best from the world —from its product selection, product design and product quality, to its management expertise and knowledge of global best practices – to China and to the Chinese consumers. 
Previously, “the” dominant player in the Chinese TV infomercial arena, Acorn’s current direct marketing model emphasizes omni-channel sales and marketing, and focuses particularly on e-commerce sales of proprietary-branded and licensed merchandise.
Acorn’s mission is to be a brand that consumers trust and to sell products that customers need and want at affordable prices.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
