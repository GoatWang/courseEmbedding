G’day Everyone,
Having studied Science, I am always drawn to Australia’s amazing flora, fauna and wilderness areas.
My photographic interests are pretty much related to Australian landscapes, rustic Australia, historic Australia, Australian wildlife, flora, fauna, birds, etc. Guess I love the country I was born and live in.
Click on a link to the right to view a collection of my photos, or scroll down for other information. Feel free to view my photos and leave some comments.
P.S. Don’t forget to say hello to my rascally rabbit.

Australia Post PostcardDuring 2012, my photo Welcome to my Forest  was selected to appear in the 2012 Living Australian Postcard Series released by Australia Post and sold at outlets across the country. Australia Post made the final decision in selecting only 6 images to appear in the series from over 2,700 photographs that were submitted nationally.
