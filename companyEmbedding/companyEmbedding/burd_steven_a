 Letter From Steve Burd, Founder and CEO
 I formed Burd Health in September 2013 to help mid to large self-insured organizations with 5,000+ plan members to achieve three ambitious outcomes:

Lower corporate healthcare expenses by 30% to 40%
Reduce employee out-of-pocket expenses
Improve employee health and fitness

 We are focused on the self-insured because self-insured companies have the freedom to design their own benefit plan… which is critical to achieving extraordinary results. The lessons we learned at Safeway, where I served as CEO for 20 years – are completely transferrable to every major U.S. company. While Safeway’s results are remarkable, 70% of the value we bring our clients today, result from products and initiatives never deployed at Safeway. Given all the complexity, distortion and disconnects in the U.S. healthcare system, the opportunity to improve efficiencies, lower cost, and improve plan member health is extraordinary.
Between 2003 and 2013, U.S. healthcare spending increased 8%. That’s no surprise – our health care system lacks market incentives, often ignores personal accountability, does not coordinate care, and takes more than 20 years to adopt best standards across all providers. While inflation has slowed recently, the Department of Health and Human Services predicts that healthcare costs will grow by 5.8% per year through 2022. That is unacceptable to us… and it is likely unacceptable to you as well.
At Burd Health, we can reverse the rising tide of healthcare spending for companies and keep more money in the pockets of employees, all while improving the overall health of your workforce.
If we don’t save your company money, there are no fees and you pay for none of our expenses. We win only when you win.

“Steve Burd is the ultimate disruptive innovator: he single-handedly took on the insurance and medical establishment with a disciplined, common sense approach to helping improve employee health while lowering costs. He is now a national icon for a new model of healthcare.”

Mark Laret, CEO, UCSF Medical Center

“Steve Burd has done more for cancer patients, their families, cancer researchers, and the cause of better healthcare for U.S. citizens in the past two decades than any other CEO in American corporate life.”

 Jonathan W. Simons MD, President and CEO, Prostate Cancer Foundation

“Steve Burd’s inspired efforts have improved the health and wellness of our nation and create a lasting legacy that will guide policy far into the future.”

Michael Milken, Chairman, The Milken Institute
 What Employees Are Saying
 
“I considered myself healthy and was regularly using the company’s fitness center. Until I had a routine lab test at our on-site clinic and the results quickly led to an end-stage kidney disease diagnosis for which the only long-term solution was a kidney transplant. Saying I was shocked would be a huge understatement. There’s no way for my family to prepare for a diagnosis like that. I immediately called our company’s health advocate program. I had access to the top doctors, learned a tremendous amount of information, and got the leading treatment plan and then the transplant surgery. I truly got the gift of life. Thank you for caring about our health and for having programs that really make a difference.”

- Thom B.
 
“I called my company’s medical advocate program a few days after my husband was diagnosed with cancer, when we had so much information to process at a very emotional time. My Advocate explained the many medical terms and treatment options specific to Jim’s type of cancer. Over a few months and numerous calls, the knowledge I gained was invaluable – it greatly relieved the anxiety a cancer diagnosis brings and focused us on the right treatment plan (for Jim’s cancer and at the cell level) to being cancer-free. Steve Burd understands the importance of employee health and I am grateful for this program.”

- Leslie D.
 
“Three years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The medical advocate service helped me understand the situation and was invaluable in navigating treatment options. I have been very impressed with the program and my results. Thank you Steve Burd, for providing this service. I highly recommend it.”

- Chia-Ching S.
 
“The healthy measures program that Steve created at my company changed not only the way I managed my own health but also for my entire family. We got healthier together, saved money, and have successfully maintained the positive results year after year. I have never felt better – it’s life changing. We are a healthier family today than I could have ever imagined.”

- Brian B.

 Steve BurdFounder and CEOSteve Burd is the Founder and CEO of Burd Health and the former Chairman and CEO of Safeway Inc. where, during his tenure, the company outperformed the S&P 500 on total shareholder return by 34 percent. This achievement is particularly noteworthy given the narrow margins of the supermarket sector.
After serving an unprecedented 20 years as CEO, Steve is now fully engaged in the healthcare sector since creating Burd Health. Burd Health is a healthcare solutions company occupying a unique space that partners with mid-to-large-cap self-insured companies to reduce costs for both the company and its employees.
The Burd Health approach also produces significant improvements in health and fitness. This endeavor is grounded in his decade’s worth of healthcare experience at Safeway including the active participation in the policy discussions that led to the Affordable Care Act, arguing for more of a market-based solution to the nation’s healthcare challenges.The discussions led to the so-called Safeway amendment, which permits self-insured employers to differentiate employee healthcare premiums (based on behavior) by as much as 50 percent.
 Ken ShachmutVice President, Product DevelopmentKen Shachmut is Vice President of Product Development at Burd Health. Prior to joining Burd Health, Ken was EVP & CFO at Safeway Health Inc. and SVP at Safeway Inc. where he led the design and implementation of Safeway’s unique and nationally-praised health benefits program.
This program reduced Safeway’s all-inclusive healthcare costs by 2% annually from 2005-2013 while costs in the rest of the US market increased 7% per year – in other words, 9 percentage points better than the national trend for eight years. The program simultaneously improved workforce health and fitness, lowering employees’ “health age” by 4 years. Earlier at Safeway, Ken had responsibility for Strategic Initiatives, and also led corporate Re-Engineering, where he identified and implemented savings worth well over $1.5 billion.
Prior to Safeway, Ken was a general management consultant for over 15 years, principally with McKinsey & Company and Booz Allen Hamilton (now Strategy&). He served clients in a broad range of industries on strategy, operations, and cost reduction.

      ■ Steven A. Burd was an evangelical Christian and a tough leader, a
      combination that puzzled his opponents but that put him in the mainstream
      of a movement that resulted in the election of another evangelical
      Christian, George W. Bush, as president of the United States in 2000; Burd
      was one of Bush's most prominent supporters in California.
      Burd's strength, and perhaps his bane, was his remarkable skill as
      a micromanager; he could increase sales from a store by merely rearranging
      the shelving on an aisle, and he could save his company money by adjusting
      how plastic bags were ordered.
    

      RAILROAD TO CONSULTING
    

      Burd's father was a railroad-yard superintendent, and Burd was
      raised primarily in Minot, North Dakota. He earned a BS in economics from
      Carroll College in 1971, and in 1973 he earned an MA in economics from the
      University of Wisconsin, after which he took a job in marketing with the
      Southern Pacific Transportation Company.
    

      In 1982 Burd joined the industrial management consulting firm of Arthur D.
      Little in New York City, where he earned a reputation for fixing broken
      companies. While at Arthur D. Little he attracted the attention of the
      management of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, a firm that
      specialized in leveraged buyouts of troubled companies. In 1986 Burd
      worked at Safeway as a management consultant after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
      bought the ailing supermarket chain. In 1987 he went into the consulting
      business for himself while continuing to help Safeway with its
      organizational problems.
    

      AILING CHAINS
    

      In 1988 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts asked him to consult at Stop &
      Shop, a chain of stores that was losing its customer base. Burd helped fix
      the chain's problems with product selection, which had not kept up
      with changing consumer tastes. In 1989 he went to Oregon to help the local
      supermarket chain Fred Meyer. Although Burd had no official title and was
      technically an outsider, as the representative of the parent company,
      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, he found he had real muscle behind him when he
      ordered changes. His most significant contribution to the chain's
      recovery was to set up management systems to keep track of operating
      expenses and how supplies related to sales.
    

      By the end of 1990 the mismanagement of Safeway was legendary, with tales
      of employees driven to suicide and others killed by work-related stress
      appearing in newspapers and magazines. Employee morale was awful, amid
      chronic fears of sudden, seemingly arbitrary dismissals and store
      closings. Safeway's prices were higher than those of its
      competitors, driving away customers, and it was losing money rapidly.
      Fresh from his two-year turnaround success at Fred Meyer, Burd was asked
      to consult again at Safeway.
    

      TURNING SAFEWAY AROUND
    

      When he returned to Safeway, Burd found a paranoid corporate culture,
      outraged labor unions, customers who felt betrayed by a chain that closed
      profitable local stores, and an accounting system that was so neglected
      that management could not know what was making money and what was not.
    

      On October 26, 1992, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts forced Safeway's
      management to accept Burd as its new president. It
       had to have been a tough situation for Burd, because the man most widely
      blamed for Safeway's woes, Peter Magowan, remained chief executive
      officer (CEO). Magowan was supposedly Burd's superior in the
      governance of the company, but in terms of micromanagement Burd had few
      peers, and he soon made his presence felt throughout the company. The
      chain had 1,100 stores, mostly in the far west of the United States and in
      Canada. It had nine regional companies, each run independently of the
      others.
    

      It took Burd years to make the nine divisions partners. He began with
      seemingly simple matters such as the procurement of plastic bags for
      bagging groceries. He found that each of the nine companies had its own
      individual deals with plastic-bag manufacturers, seven altogether. As he
      would for procurement in general, Burd centralized at corporate
      headquarters in Oakland, California, the ordering of plastic bags by
      narrowing the suppliers to two, which translated into a savings of $2.5
      million per year. Burd introduced streamlined systems of cost analysis,
      which also resulted in savings. For example, store managers reported that
      in-store salad bars were earning 40 percent margins, a big boost for a
      company that was losing money. Yet when Burd examined the losses due to
      spoilage and the cost of labor to maintain the salad bars, he discovered
      that they were actually losing money, so he had them eliminated. For 1992
      Safeway grossed $15.2 billion, and its shares sold for about $5.
    

      On April 30, 1993, Burd was appointed CEO as well as president of Safeway,
      with Magowan remaining as chairman of the board but no longer involved
      with the day-to-day operations of the company. Burd took to visiting
      individual stores to study layouts, products, and even the ambient music
      and lighting. He began adjusting each store's produce section to
      suit the ethnic preferences of the neighborhood; adding, for example, more
      mangos in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods. He was distressed by the
      amount of produce and other perishables that was spoiling on shelves and
      pressured store managers to keep their produce fresh. He introduced
      organic produce to Safeway, reasoning that low prices alone would not make
      customers loyal and that special, high-quality products could help cement
      consumer loyalty.
    

      Burd succeeded at lowering shelf prices to make Safeway competitive with
      other supermarkets. The savings that resulted from his management reforms
      were used to lower prices further, remodel stores, train employees to give
      better service, and to introduce the Safeway Select line of premium
      in-house products, which became very successful at attracting and
      retaining customers who wanted a brand line they could trust. Although
      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had reintroduced Safeway to the stock market in
      1990, it still held 67 percent of the shares, and its support helped
      Burd's reforms stick. By the end of 1993 Safeway had achieved a 1
      percent profit margin, about the industry standard, which at the time was
      regarded as significant evidence of Safeway's new efficiency and
      improved customer service. On September 7, 1993, Burd was elected to
      Safeway's board of directors.
    

      In 1995 Burd began the Safeway Category Optimization Process, which
      considered a store's offerings aisle by aisle rather than by
      product category. The idea was to put products on the aisles where
      customers would expect to find them. In 1996 Safeway owned 35 percent of
      Vons, a southern California supermarket chain. Burd forced a buyout of the
      remaining 65 percent of shares from a reluctant Vons management. This
      expanded Safeway's holdings to 1,377 stores, employing 140,000
      workers. Customer service improved throughout Safeway's stores,
      with employees remembering frequent customers by name and escorting
      customers to the appropriate aisles when they asked about a specific
      product. Insistence that employees smile at customers may have backfired
      when some women employees protested that their smiles elicited unwanted
      interest from male customers. The price per share of Safeway stock rose to
      $80. Burd believed that enabling employees to invest in Safeway stock was
      good for the financial health of both the employee and the company, and he
      believed shares needed to be priced low enough that employees could easily
      invest in them, so in 1996 he had Safeway split its shares two for one.
    

      By 1997 one-fourth of Safeway's employees owned 15 percent of the
      company's stock. Burd developed a program of sending anonymous
      inspectors into individual Safeway stores to check on the service provided
      to customers. Safeway's private-label plants were selling their
      products to other Kohlberg Kravis Roberts chains, increasing the profits
      realized at each plant. Safeway's sales increased 48 percent, and
      the chain tried to underprice its competitors on average shelf prices.
      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts lowered its holding of Safeway stock to 50
      percent. Safeway netted $1.3 billion in 1997, and Burd sought to use the
      money to acquire new stores, believing that by increasing its size Safeway
      would achieve an economy of scale that would allow it to survive the
      looming challenges of discount chains such as Wal-Mart and Target.
    

      EXPANSION
    

      On May 12, 1998, Burd was elected Safeway's chairman of the board,
      with Magowan remaining only as a director. This was Burd's chance
      to fully shake loose from his predecessor. Meanwhile, Kohlberg Kravis
      Roberts brought its holding in Safeway down to 16 percent, meaning that
      Burd was largely free of their oversight, too. By October 1998
      Safeway's shares were selling for $43.63 (after the split) and its
      financing seemed strong enough for Burd to make a daring move: In November
      1998 Safeway bought Dominick's Finer Food of Illinois for $1.8
      billion, consisting of cash and an assumed debt of $646 million.
      Dominick's had 113 stores and was a chain
       known for its premium products. Three years earlier the chain had been
      purchased for $693 million by Yucaipa Companies, owned by Los Angeles
      magnate Ron Burkle; the sale to Safeway was a big windfall for him, and
      financial analysts criticized Safeway for paying too much.
      Dominick's had cost Safeway about $16 million per store, compared
      with $11.3 million per store in the 1996 Vons deal.
    

      Burd was sure he could turn Dominick's into a powerful asset the
      way he had made Safeway into one—by careful attention to details.
      Safeway invested $294 million into improvements at Dominick's,
      rearranging store layouts, widening aisles, and introducing
      Safeway's highly successful house brands. Dominick's
      employees were paid about $3 per hour more than those at local rival
      Jewel, owned by Albertsons, making it difficult to compete on shelf price.
      Burd cut staffing at Dominick's to try to lower expenses. The
      initial results were not good. Customers were unhappy that comfortable old
      layouts had been replaced by Safeway's open configuration and that
      Safeway brands had replaced premium name brands. For three consecutive
      years Dominick's income declined, and its regional market-share
      fell from 28 percent to 23 percent. To be fair to Burd, high-quality
      Safeway brands had achieved margins as high as 30 percent in the Vons
      chain as well as at other Safeway stores, giving reason to expect them to
      find appreciative buyers in Illinois.
    

      In 1999 Safeway purchased Randall's Food Markets of Texas. To
      realize quick savings, Safeway reduced the chain's product
      selection and, as at Dominick's, introduced its house brands to
      customers unfamiliar with them. At both Dominick's and
      Randall's understaffing caused long lines at checkout registers,
      angering customers and lowering employee morale. Burd had long believed
      that high employee morale would result in better customer service, and he
      believed Safeway could excel in customer service, making its stores more
      attractive to shoppers than those of competitors, so the decline in morale
      was to him a serious problem.
    

      Burd believed that a key asset was store location—placing stores
      where they were most convenient for shoppers. Thus, he was always looking
      for ideal store locations. In May 2000, for example, Safeway bought six
      stores in Houston from Albertsons because they seemed well placed.
      Burd's aggressive moves to acquire more stores created excitement
      among investors and journalists, and by 2001 rumors were rife about what
      his next moves would be. That year Safeway's stock peaked at a
      little over $60 per share, an increase in value of $10 billion since 1993.
      The chain's sales had doubled since 1993, and the profit margin was
      4 percent, a big increase over 1993.
    

      In February 2001 Safeway bought 11 stores in Arizona from Abco Foods, then
      purchased the Genuardi's Family Markets supermarket chain in
      Pennsylvania for $528 million. Genuardi's had 44 stores. Thereafter
      Genuardi's developed a reputation for poorly stocked shelves and
      poor produce. Burd viewed Safeway's advantages as location,
      selection, perishables, and service, but market forces were turning
      against him. In October 2001 United Food and Commercial Workers Union
      (UFCW) members struck three Safeway stores in Thunder Bay, Ontario,
      Canada. Burd said that Safeway had to contain its labor costs in order to
      compete with challenges from discount chains, and he threatened to close
      the stores rather than give in. In June 2002, after months of
      negotiations, he did just that.
    

      In 2002 Safeway took over $1.2 billion in write downs (admitting the value
      of assets had gone down), a $589 million charge on Dominick's in
      April (taking a loss in value), and a $788 million charge on
      Dominick's again in November 2002. In November 2002 Safeway put
      Dominick's up for sale. Safeway's books valued
      Dominick's at only $315 million. Ron Burkle's Yucaipa
      Companies offered Safeway $350 million to buy back Dominick's, but
      Safeway turned him down; Burkle said he felt slighted by Safeway. In
      August 2003 Safeway sued Burkle for interfering in negotiations with
      Dominick's union, costing Safeway a purchaser for the chain because
      the purchaser could not reach an agreement with the union. Increases in
      costs of meat and dairy products further hurt Safeway's bottom
      line, because in a low-inflation economy it would have a hard time
      justifying increases in prices to its shoppers. Meanwhile, conditions at
      Genuardi's had deteriorated so badly that Safeway ran newspaper ads
      apologizing to customers and asking them to forgive Safeway and to try
      shopping at Genuardi's stores again. For 2002 Safeway grossed $35.7
      billion, but it lost $828 million.
    

      RIDING A HURRICANE
    

      Events in 2003-2004 almost cost Burd his career and Safeway its financial
      strength. Wal-Mart announced that it would open 40
      supercenters—stores that sold a full line of groceries as well as
      Wal-Mart's other offerings—in California. Discount chains in
      general, but Wal-Mart in particular, worried Burd and other supermarket
      leaders because they could significantly underprice traditional
      supermarkets. The biggest advantage for Wal-Mart seemed to be in the cost
      of labor. Wal-Mart employees were paid on average about $8 per hour less
      than Safeway employees and received few benefits, whereas Safeway's
      employees enjoyed some of the best benefits for retail workers anywhere in
      the country. The charge by the federal government in 2003 that Wal-Mart
      employed illegal immigrants who received no benefits only heightened the
      anxiety Wal-Mart caused its competitors.
    

      Burd said that labor costs were a threat to the supermarket
      industry's survival, that high wages and benefits made it
      impossible for the chains to compete with Wal-Mart and Target, which were
      nonunion. On October 11, 2003, the UFCW went on strike against
      Safeway's Vons stores in southern California.
       Vons had 326 stores and generated 19 percent of Safeway's sales.
      In support of Safeway, Albertsons and Ralph's, which was owned by
      Kroger Company, locked out UFCW workers. Union leaders said they chose to
      strike only Vons because Vons would have the toughest negotiators. The
      three supermarket chains made Burd their spokesperson. Mindful of his
      belief that employee morale translated into customer service, Burd moved
      to mitigate some of the hardships of striking Vons workers by setting up a
      fund to aid workers with mortgage bills, car payments, and other expenses,
      hoping to alleviate the hard feelings that would result from a strike. On
      October 16, 2003, Burd said the three supermarket chains had made their
      final offer to the union, declaring that the only changes that could be
      made to the offer would be to make it "less good"
      (SignOnSanDiego.com, October 26, 2003). Burd wanted to cut
      Safeway's contributions to health care from $3.85 per hour worked
      to $1.35 per hour worked. For its part, the UFCW feared that Safeway could
      set a precedent that would affect contract negotiations throughout the
      United States.
    

      Safeway's share price fell to $22 on October 24, 2003, which was
      still much higher than it had been in 1993. While Burd talked publicly
      about the long-term future of the industry and labor costs, he was working
      on revolutionary changes in how the supermarket industry dealt with
      vendors. For decades supermarket chains charged vendors for shelf space
      and shelf position; that is, in order to have its products placed in a
      good position on stores shelves, the vendor would pay the chain in cash.
      In 2003 Burd was reworking, in his typically meticulous fashion, the
      relationship between Safeway and vendors, demanding not cash for product
      placement, but price concessions. He saw Safeway's future in buying
      products for the lowest real-market value and then passing on the lowered
      prices to consumers. The prices might not beat those of discount chains,
      but they could be low enough that with superior products and service
      Safeway would attract customers away from Wal-Mart and its ilk. Further,
      he started having stores remodeled to be more comfortable for shoppers,
      installing imitation wood floors and softer lighting, for example. Market
      studies had indicated that shoppers found Wal-Mart stores chaotic and
      anxious; Burd sought to make Safeway's stores welcoming and
      calming. For 2003 Safeway grossed $35.6 billion but lost $170 million,
      failing to make a profit because it lost $696 million in the fourth
      quarter of the year, mostly due to lost revenue from its Vons stores.
    

      The West Coast leader of the UFCW was Sean Harrigan, a friend whom Burkle
      had helped become president of the California Public Employees Retirement
      System (CalPERS). In March 2004 CalPERS and the pension funds of New York,
      Illinois, and Connecticut, each owning shares in Safeway, urged fellow
      shareholders to oppose Burd during the May 20, 2004, meeting of
      shareholders. A few financial analysts recommended that their clients vote
      to oust Burd. In January 2004 about 250 demonstrators tried to march to
      Burd's home but were stopped by the gates and guards. They prayed
      and called Burd evil. He was vilified in the press and on Web sites for
      being greedy, for costing shareholders $20 billion in stock value during a
      decline since 2001, and for abusing the rights of employees.
    

      The southern California strike was settled in February 2004 in an
      arbitrated compromise that left workers with wages and benefits higher
      than in other retail businesses. Safeway's stock value was
      increasing, to over $28 per share. Shareholders complained that
      Safeway's board of directors lacked independence and profited from
      doing business with Safeway. Thus, the board dismissed three directors.
      Burd and two other longtime directors from the 1980s were targeted in the
      shareholders meeting, but each was reelected with over 80 percent of the
      vote. A proposition to separate the offices of CEO and chairman of the
      board received only 33.2 percent of the vote. Even so, a new position of
      lead independent director was created to help look after the interests of
      shareholders.
