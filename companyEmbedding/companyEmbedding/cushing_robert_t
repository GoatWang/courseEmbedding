July 1, 2013 - Albany
, NY


ALBANY, N.Y., July 1, 2013 - Bank executive Robert T. Cushing has been elected chairman of the Albany Medical Center Board of Directors. His two-year term begins today. 
Cushing, who is executive vice president and chief financial officer of TrustCo Bank Corp, has served as a member of Albany Med's board since 2004 and as vice-chair since 2007. He has served on numerous committees and ad hoc committees, and played an instrumental role in the development of Albany Med's $360 million Patient Pavilion project, which opens later this year."I look forward to working with Jim Barba and all of the Medical Center employees as we adapt to national changes in health care policy while continuing to deliver the highest quality patient care, medical education, and research possible," Cushing said.  "Bob Cushing's extraordinary business success and keen financial insight have been and will continue to be tremendous assets for Albany Med as we expand to meet the health care needs of our region," said Albany Medical Center president and CEO James J. Barba. Cushing replaces R. Wayne Diesel, who served as chair since 2009. Barba said, "Wayne Diesel provided outstanding leadership during a time of tremendous expansion for Albany Med and extraordinary changes in health care. His dedicated service has positioned our institution well for building on our success and facing the challenges ahead."A highly successful executive, Cushing has been with TrustCo Bank Corp since 1994, serving as CFO and in other executive level positions. Before joining TrustCo, he was a partner at KPMG. A graduate of Siena College, Cushing also served as chairman of the Siena College Board of Trustees and is treasurer of the Schenectady Foundation. In 2009, he was named Public Company CFO of the Year by the Capital District Business Review.Albany Medical Center, northeastern New York's only academic health sciences center, is one of the largest private employers in the Capital Region. It incorporates the 651-bed Albany Medical Center Hospital, which offers the widest range of medical and surgical services in the region, and the Albany Medical College, which trains the next generation of doctors, scientists and other healthcare professionals, and also includes a biomedical research enterprise and the region's largest physicians practice with nearly 400 doctors.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

EQUINE CUSHINGS DISEASE









EQUINE 
          CUSHING'S DISEASE
by Robert A Eustace FRCVS

          Abstracted from the scrutineered veterinary journal In Practice (1991)
          Vol 13. No 4 July p 147-148















Despite 
          demonstrating obvious abnormalities of clinical appearance, both the 
          dog and the pony (Plates 1 & 2) are suffering from the same condition; 
          Cushing's Syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism). Hyperadrenocorticism 
          produces the opposite changes in hair coat in the two species. 
          In equines this condition is usually secondary to an adenoma, or hyperplasia, 
          of the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland whereas in the dog the 
          syndrome may be primarily of adrenal origin.
In horses there 
          appears to be insufficient DOPamine being released from the hypothalamus. 
          DOPamine inhibits the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland. Therefore 
          when there is less DOPamine there is less inhibition of the pars intermedia 
          which then increases in size.
Equine 
          Cushing's cases always develop laminitis if they live long enough. They 
          may become immunosuppressed and subject to a variety of parasitic or 
          infectious agents such as helminthiasis or pneumonia. Many cases show 
          muscle loss and become polydipsic and polyphagic; they may be diabetic. 
          A supra-orbital swelling, due to the deposition of a fat depot, is commonly 
          seen giving the eyes a protuberant appearance.
To 
          the trained observer, these cases can be diagnosed on clinical appearance 
          and history alone. The clinical signs include; 
Failure 
          to shed their coat in Spring, the coat becomes long, thick and matted.
Affected 
          animals tend to sweat more than normal, they lose weight despite an 
          increased appetite.
They 
          may become diabetic, either diabetes mellitus, (sugar diabetes) or diabetes 
          insipidus. They therefore drink excessively, and if stabled you will 
          notice their bedding is quickly soaked.
They 
          show filling above the eyes. This is fat deposition in the supra-orbital 
          fossae. [Normal horses have depressions above the eyes, you can see 
          these depressions moving when a horse chews].
They 
          become depressed and ill-looking, with dull eyes and they lose the shine 
          on their coat.
They 
          all develop laminitis eventually.
Their 
          body shape changes so that they lose muscle mass, developing a dipped 
          back, poorly muscled neck and quarters with a pendulous abdomen. There 
          is a re-distribution of fat depots. The horse looking thin ("ribby") 
          but gaining a rather "blocky" appearance. This is particularly 
          evident if it has been dieted in the mistaken belief that it's laminitis 
          is due to obesity.
Their 
          resistance to infections or worm burdens is reduced.

Confirmatory 
          tests
 The test regime 
          I am using now is to measure endogenous ACTH, cortisol, insulin and 
          glucose from venous blood samples at 0900 hours before the morning feed 
          and in a quiet environment. This is a simple test to use, although the 
          blood cells have to be separated from the plasma and the sample kept 
          frozen prior to testing. This test does not run the risk of inducing 
          or worsening laminitis following the administration of a corticosteroid. 
          It will differentiate between pituitary dependent Cushing's cases and 
          those animals with obesity related laminitis. 
Treatments 
          for Pituitary dependent Cushing's disease
In 
          some animals the pituitary pathology seems to result in little disability 
          other than the change in the haircoat. In other more advanced cases 
          recurrent episodes of laminitis result or the animal may eventually 
          succumb to an overwhelming systemic infection. However many cases showing 
          the classical changes in the hair coat can live happily for years before 
          they become laminitic, diabetic or begin to lose condition. Even if 
          the animal has suffered laminitis but in other respects appears well, 
          these cases can be greatly improved by correct foot dressing and/or 
          shoeing. The precise prevalence of pituitary dependent Cushing's disease 
          is unknown but it is probably quite common in elderly individuals. The 
          youngest case I have seen was 8 years old. 
If 
          you only realise that your horse has pituitary dependent Cushing's disease 
          when it gets an attack of laminitis, then the outlook can be grave. 
          In some cases the normal laminitis treatments of acepromazine and phenylbutazone 
          are not "strong" enough to correct the vasoconstriction in 
          the feet. In these cases I have used phenoxybenzamine drips, over 48 
          hours, successfully. The horse should really be hospitalised if this 
          is to be undertaken.
The 
          long term prognosis for Cushing's Disease cases if bad, if they also 
          have chronic founder then this worsens the prognosis. However there 
          are a couple of drugs which have proved valuable for treatment. The 
          treatment does not cure the change in the pituitary gland but reduces 
          the amount of the hormones which are released from it. These treatments 
          can give horses a good quality of life for 2 years or more. Although 
          the treatments are recommended for year round medication we have found 
          that in many cases treatment can be tailed off then stopped in the Spring 
          and started again in the Autumn. This is because the pituitary gland 
          receives information from the pineal gland (the third eye) indicating 
          the day length. Most horses with Cushing's Disease come down with laminitis 
          in the Autumn, as day length shortens, and in the Winter. If Cushing's 
          Disease laminitis cases are left untreated they cannot self cure and 
          suffer laminitis continually.
Some 
temporary improvement in the clinical condition of about 80% of cases has resulted 
following treatment with cyproheptadine (Periactin). However, at best this results 
in a temporary improvement in the clinical condition of the animal. No treatment 
has a curative effect.

The drug is expensive so if you use it make sure the horse eats it ! The surest 
way is to feed it from the hand either in a titbit or a sandwich. Potential adverse 
reactions in horses include inappetance, transient anorexia and lethargy, mild 
central nervous system signs (e.g. mild depression and mild ataxia), diarrhoea 
and colic!
Dosage 
2 microgrammes per kg bodyweight daily as a continuing treatment. This drug is 
much more expensive than Periactin but seems a little more reliable in achieving 
a positive response.
Trilostane 
          (120mg capsules)
This 
          drug is being trialled by Cathy McGowan of the Royal Veterinary College, 
          London. Her preliminary findings are posted 
          on this site. For further information ask your veterinary surgeon to 
          contact Dr McGowan.
Vitex trial
The 
Laminitis Trust has conducted a trial using an extract of the plant Monkspepper 
or Chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus). This herbal extract has shown to be effective 
in controlling the effects of Cushing's disease in horses. Click

Obesity related 
          laminitis
I have encouraged 
          all horse owners over the last 10 years not to allow their horses to 
          become obese, as this puts them at high risk of laminitis. Although 
          we are not sure exactly why this occurs, we do know that many fat horses 
          show insulin resistance, in other words they do not show a lowering 
          of blood sugar concentrations when injected with insulin. Recently, 
          Dr Johnson in the US has suggested a possible explanation. 
He has suggested 
          that fat horses and ponies may be suffering from a syndrome which has 
          been well recognised in humans, that of Omental Cushing's disease. In 
          humans, the omentum, a fatty sheet which covers the intestines, becomes 
          an abnormal site for the production of the hormone cortisol. The omentum 
          in these individuals contains an aberrant set of enzymes which convert 
          the person's own inactive cortisone into the active form cortisol. This 
          increased amount of circulating cortisol has an adverse effect on the 
          horse's carbohydrate metabolism causing an increased blood glucose and 
          insulin.
A similar situation may 
be occurring in fat horses which show high concentrations of circulating, cortisol, 
insulin and glucose, are hard to diet and often suffer from laminitis. This syndrome 
in horses is sometimes referred to as Peripheral Cushing's disease though I think 
this is not a very good name as the extra cortisol is not coming from the adrenal 
gland. Omental Cushing's Disease, Peripheral Cushing's Disease and insulin resistance 
all mean the same thing when relating to equids.
The new test we 
          are using, measuring endogenous ACTH, cortisol, insulin and glucose 
          can differentiate pituitary dependent Cushing's cases from obesity related 
          laminitis.
