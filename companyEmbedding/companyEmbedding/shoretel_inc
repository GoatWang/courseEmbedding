    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Why ShoreTel, Inc. Stock Plunged Today
The telecommunications products specialist fell short in its latest quarter.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Apr 29, 2016 at 8:21PM
            
            






IMAGE SOURCE: SHORETEL INC.

What: Shares of ShoreTel (NASDAQ: SHOR) dropped 14.2% Friday after the telecommunications vendor announced weaker-than-expected fiscal third-quarter 2016 results.
So what: Quarterly revenue rose 0.6% year over year, to $85.2 million, and based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), translated to a net loss of $8.7 million, or $0.13 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation and acquisitions expenses, ShoreTel's net loss came in at $3.9 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per share in the same year-ago period. Analysts, on average, were anticipating a narrower adjusted net loss of $0.04 per share, and higher revenue of $88.6 million.
ShoreTel CEO Don Joos focused on what went right, stating: "In the fiscal third quarter we accelerated both cloud bookings and hosted revenue, with particular strength from mid-market and enterprise customers. We continued to execute on our five catalysts for growth as we introduced new ShoreTel Connect Features, expanded our cloud geographic footprint, and launched the premises to cloud migration program to leverage our installed base to drive hosted revenue growth."
Hosted revenue climbed 22% year over year, to $32.8 million, and ShoreTel's total number of installed customer seats rose 27%, to 218,000. Meanwhile, support and services revenue rose 1% year over year, to $18.5 million. And recurring revenue, which is comprised of combined revenue from hosted and related services, as well as support, represented 58% of ShoreTel's total revenue during the quarter. However, this growth was almost entirely offset by a 14% year-over-year decline in product revenue, to $33.9 million.
Now what: For the current quarter, ShoreTel anticipates revenue of $88 million to $94 million, well below analysts' consensus estimates calling for $96.2 million.
ShoreTel is undeniably making progress capitalizing on its strategic-growth catalysts. But investors can't ignore the fact that progress is being thwarted by declines in its core-products segment. Given ShoreTel's quarterly miss and light guidance, it's hard to blame the market for taking a step back today.

Say Goodbye to Business Communications Complexity
Tired of managing multiple vendors, complicated phone system protocols, or restrictive network solutions?  Want an office phone system that "just works," no matter your size, industry or need? 
ShoreTel IP business phone systems streamline the work of administrators and end users alike. Whether you want to simplify phone system management with a cloud-based VoIP phone service, maintain control with an on-premises phone system, or a hybrid of both, ShoreTel can help.




Featured Resource 5 WAYS UPDATING YOUR PHONE SYSTEM DRIVES BUSINESS SUCCESS
Has your business phone system kept pace with the times? This eGuide helps you to better understand how an updated phone system can help you reduce costs, improve the user experience and grow with your business.









Customers Love Us Don't Just Take Our Word for It...

“I think you get a lot more value from a ShoreTel phone system than from competing systems. When you factor in reliability, ease of implementation, ease of maintenance and extendibility, ShoreTel is a no brainer.”
Tod Skinner President, American Engineering Group (AEG) International










What Is An IP Phone System?
At the heart of every business phone system is the PBX (Private Branch Exchange), which connects an organization’s telephones to each other and to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Traditional hard-wired PBX phone systems evolved in the 1990s to use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to carry calls. 
An IP PBX phone system - also known as a VoIP PBX, IP-PBX, virtual PBX or IPBX - consists of VoIP enabled phones and an IP PBX.  The phones register with the IP PBX server, and when they make a call the IP PBX establishes, maintains, and releases the connection. VoIP phones can be simple software-based softphones or hardware devices like desk phones or conference phones.
But today’s IP phone systems offer much more than call processing. ShoreTel’s IP phone systems are a scalable unified communications and collaboration hub for your business, integrating features such as video conferencing, instant messaging (IM), online collaboration, and mobility to extend your business communications wherever you are. By eliminating separate tools, ShoreTel's brilliantly simple VoIP phone services make it easier for your teams to boost productivity and reduce phone system costs.
ShoreTel’s Cloud-based VoIP Phone Services
For businesses looking to simplify communications processes and free up IT teams to focus on core business deliverables, a cloud phone service is an ideal fit.
Designed on the same codebase as our on-premises phone system, ShoreTel Connect CLOUD is engineered for maximum reliability and functionality without the efforts of onsite maintenance. An "end-to-end" solution, ShoreTel engineers every aspect - from the phones to the cloud architecture to the applications software - so that you have one hand to shake for your entire business VoIP solution.
ShoreTel’s cloud IP phone services go beyond just dial tone to deliver rich unified communications, flexible collaboration tools and convenient mobility options that are easy to implement and easy to use from your desk, your home office or anywhere in between.
ShoreTel’s Onsite Business Phone Systems
ShoreTel onsite IP phone systems pioneered a fundamentally different approach to IP PBX technology. Built strategically on a single-image architecture, the ShoreTel Connect ONSITE IP phones and unified communications grow across as many sites or continents as you need. 
Our distributed architecture is incorporated into a unique onsite, appliance-based, IP PBX where each switch and site functions as an independent call processor, eliminating single points of failure and resulting in 99.999% availability. Plus, IT staff can easily manage the entire system through an intuitive web-based interface.
ShoreTel's on-premises IP PBX phone system also offers the lowest Total Cost of Operation (TCO) in the industry, with many customers reporting a ROI within a year. With powerful unified communications features and pre-built integrations with popular business applications, ShoreTel VoIP phone systems make it easier than ever to streamline business interactions and help you get more out of your most valuable assets: people and information.
ShoreTel Hybrid Phone Systems
When you need the flexibility of the cloud but want to still retain onsite control of primary phone system components, a hybrid PBX solution can be the perfect fit. Hybrid deployment models are also ideally suited to organizations that are looking to make a phased migration to using a fully cloud-based phone service.
ShoreTel Connect HYBRID gives you the mix and match to perfectly meet the needs of your business by deploying our onsite phone system while conveniently adding productivity applications or satellite locations via the cloud. Cloud applications such as fax, voicemail transcription and contact center functionality can be added on-demand, helping increase employee productivity while minimizing the impact on IT teams.
Plus, for businesses experiencing rapid growth or supporting remote workers, ShoreTel’s hybrid phone system also makes it possible to turn up new users or locations via the cloud and manage everything from a single portal.



Need more help deciding?
As you consider which IP phone system is right for you – cloud, onsite or a hybrid of the two – there are a few key areas to evaluate to help you find the best phone system for your business.

Additional Information



Overview of ShoreTel SkyUpdated: Jul 23, 2017ShoreTel Sky OverviewShoreTel Sky is a call center management solution for businesses of all sizes. Its core services 

include cloud phone system, hosted contact center, and unified communication management. The 

software was designed and launched by ShoreTel Inc headquartered in California, United States.
ShoreTel Sky Average Rating  This software product is not yet rated
ShoreTel Sky Typical CustomersThe software can be deployed for small call centers as well as medium and large enterprises. 

It has been used in such sectors and domains as education, financial services, healthcare 

and hospitality, non-profit organizations, real estate, retail and wholesale, and others. Some 

major customers of the software include Foursquare, The Meatball Shop, and MEM Property 

Management etc.ShoreTel Sky FeaturesThe software offers cloud based phone system which means that clients can keep in touch with 

customers from anywhere. It also offers metrics and insights into customer experience and 

provides suggestions for optimization. For streamlined sales experience, the software connects 

customer data with conversations and calls in the corporate CRM system. 
 
ShoreTel Sky offers inbound calling capabilities of call queue management, call queuing, 

private branch exchange, and voicemail. Its analytical capabilities include call monitoring, call 

recording, and real time reporting. The software also offers skill based routing, call list imports, 

and computer telephony integration etc.
ShoreTel Sky AlternativesThe two main competitors for ShoreTel Sky are Nextiva and Vonage Business Solutions.
 
Vonage Business Solutions is a leading VOIP solution provider that can handle a company’s telephony 

requirements without the need for a dedicated phone exchange. It offers three editions based on the 

size and requirements of the implementation. There is a metered edition for small companies with 

charges based on calling volume, and an unlimited extensions edition which gives unlimited calls. For 

companies that require access only via smart phones and no VOIP phones they can also choose the 

virtual extensions edition.
 
In comparison ShoreTel Sky provides a VOIP solution with traditional telephony requirements, but also 

provides support for calls from smart phones. In addition ShoreTel Sky also includes a collaboration 

platform for shared communications which is not supported by Vonage Business Solutions.
 
Another VOIP solution provider is Nextiva which is distinguished by its fairly unique guaranteed uptime 

of 99.9%. This is very beneficial for larger organizations which are highly dependent on telephone 

communications and cannot afford any disruption to this service. Additionally the product also 

integrates a hosted call center as well which enables agents to work remotely.
 
Shortel Sky on the other hand does include a hosted contact center, but also includes support for unified 

communications which is independent of device usage. This includes support for faxes, on demand 

conferencing, as well as voicemail to email transcription. Additionally the product provides easy 

integration to third party software through an open API which is not fully supported by its competitors.
ShoreTel Sky Pricing InformationThe price is available on request.
