            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Forestar Group Inc. is a real estate, oil and gas, and other natural resources company based in Austin, Texas. The company owns directly or through ventures almost 120,000 acres (49,000 ha) of real estate located in ten states and 13 markets, approximately 590,000 acres of oil and gas mineral interests and approximately 358,000 net acres of leasehold oil and gas interests.[1]

1 Overview
2 Company history

4 References



Overview[edit]
The company operates three business segments: Real Estate, Oil and Gas, and Other Natural Resources.
The real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on its lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities, and develops multi-family apartments. Forestar invests in new projects in strategic growth corridors, which represent markets with significant growth characteristics for population, employment and household formation that make them attractive for long-term real estate investment.
The real estate segment has 11 real estate projects representing approximately 24,400 acres currently in the entitlement process, and 73 projects entitled, developed, or under development in eight states and 13 markets. The company sells land for commercial uses to national retailers and local commercial developers. In addition, the company will sell its undeveloped land, principally in Georgia, when it has reached its highest and best use. The company markets land for sale on its web site.[2]
The oil and gas segment is focused on driving exploration and production activity in high quality, lower risk conventional and unconventional oil and gas prospects on its fee and leasehold mineral interests. Leasehold interests include acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Forestar also seeks to maximize the value from royalties and other lease revenues from its fee oil and gas mineral interests located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
Other natural resources includes the sale of wood fiber, primarily in Georgia, and manages the company’s recreational leases, and approximately 1.5 million acres of groundwater resources including a 45% nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes from approximately 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama and about 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in Central Texas.
Company history[edit]
The company’s origins date back to the 1955 incorporation of Lumbermen’s Investment Corporation, which in 2006 changed its name to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group Inc. The company has a long legacy of residential and commercial real estate development operations, primarily in Texas. In 1991, Forestar and Cousins Properties Incorporated[3] formed Temco Associates, LLC as a venture to develop residential sites in Paulding County, Georgia, and in 2002 Forestar and Cousins formed CL Realty, L.L.C. as a venture to develop residential and mixed-use communities in Texas and across the southeastern U.S. Those ventures continue today. In 2001, Forestar opened an office in the Atlanta area to manage nearby land with a focus on its long-term real estate development potential. In 2006, Temple-Inland Inc. began reporting Forestar Real Estate Group as a separate business segment. On December 28, 2007, Temple-Inland distributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Forestar’s common stock to its shareholders. In September 2012, Forestar acquired CREDO Petroleum, an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with leasehold interests in over 135,000 net mineral acres.

S&P 600 Component


Headquarters
Austin, Texas


Website
www.forestargroup.com


Forestar Group Inc. is a real estate, oil and gas, and other natural resources company based in Austin, Texas. The company owns directly or through ventures almost 120,000 acres (49,000 ha) of real estate located in ten states and 13 markets, approximately 590,000 acres of oil and gas mineral interests and approximately 358,000 net acres of leasehold oil and gas interests.[1]



Contents


1 Overview
2 Company history
3 External links
4 References



Overview[edit]
The company operates three business segments: Real Estate, Oil and Gas, and Other Natural Resources.
The real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on its lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities, and develops multi-family apartments. Forestar invests in new projects in strategic growth corridors, which represent markets with significant growth characteristics for population, employment and household formation that make them attractive for long-term real estate investment.
The real estate segment has 11 real estate projects representing approximately 24,400 acres currently in the entitlement process, and 73 projects entitled, developed, or under development in eight states and 13 markets. The company sells land for commercial uses to national retailers and local commercial developers. In addition, the company will sell its undeveloped land, principally in Georgia, when it has reached its highest and best use. The company markets land for sale on its web site.[2]
The oil and gas segment is focused on driving exploration and production activity in high quality, lower risk conventional and unconventional oil and gas prospects on its fee and leasehold mineral interests. Leasehold interests include acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Forestar also seeks to maximize the value from royalties and other lease revenues from its fee oil and gas mineral interests located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
Other natural resources includes the sale of wood fiber, primarily in Georgia, and manages the company’s recreational leases, and approximately 1.5 million acres of groundwater resources including a 45% nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes from approximately 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama and about 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in Central Texas.
Company history[edit]
The company’s origins date back to the 1955 incorporation of Lumbermen’s Investment Corporation, which in 2006 changed its name to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group Inc. The company has a long legacy of residential and commercial real estate development operations, primarily in Texas. In 1991, Forestar and Cousins Properties Incorporated[3] formed Temco Associates, LLC as a venture to develop residential sites in Paulding County, Georgia, and in 2002 Forestar and Cousins formed CL Realty, L.L.C. as a venture to develop residential and mixed-use communities in Texas and across the southeastern U.S. Those ventures continue today. In 2001, Forestar opened an office in the Atlanta area to manage nearby land with a focus on its long-term real estate development potential. In 2006, Temple-Inland Inc. began reporting Forestar Real Estate Group as a separate business segment. On December 28, 2007, Temple-Inland distributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Forestar’s common stock to its shareholders. In September 2012, Forestar acquired CREDO Petroleum, an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with leasehold interests in over 135,000 net mineral acres.

The real estate segment has 11 real estate projects representing approximately 24,400 acres currently in the entitlement process, and 73 projects entitled, developed, or under development in eight states and 13 markets. The company sells land for commercial uses to national retailers and local commercial developers. In addition, the company will sell its undeveloped land, principally in Georgia, when it has reached its highest and best use. The company markets land for sale on its web site.[2]
The oil and gas segment is focused on driving exploration and production activity in high quality, lower risk conventional and unconventional oil and gas prospects on its fee and leasehold mineral interests. Leasehold interests include acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Forestar also seeks to maximize the value from royalties and other lease revenues from its fee oil and gas mineral interests located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
Other natural resources includes the sale of wood fiber, primarily in Georgia, and manages the company’s recreational leases, and approximately 1.5 million acres of groundwater resources including a 45% nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes from approximately 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama and about 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in Central Texas.
Company history[edit]
The company’s origins date back to the 1955 incorporation of Lumbermen’s Investment Corporation, which in 2006 changed its name to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group Inc. The company has a long legacy of residential and commercial real estate development operations, primarily in Texas. In 1991, Forestar and Cousins Properties Incorporated[3] formed Temco Associates, LLC as a venture to develop residential sites in Paulding County, Georgia, and in 2002 Forestar and Cousins formed CL Realty, L.L.C. as a venture to develop residential and mixed-use communities in Texas and across the southeastern U.S. Those ventures continue today. In 2001, Forestar opened an office in the Atlanta area to manage nearby land with a focus on its long-term real estate development potential. In 2006, Temple-Inland Inc. began reporting Forestar Real Estate Group as a separate business segment. On December 28, 2007, Temple-Inland distributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Forestar’s common stock to its shareholders. In September 2012, Forestar acquired CREDO Petroleum, an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with leasehold interests in over 135,000 net mineral acres.

Forestar terminates Starwood merger deal to go with D.R. Horton's stock purchase deal
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  fell 3.2% in premarket trade Thursday, after the land developer terminated its merger deal with Starwood Capital Group, so it could go with the D.R. Horton Inc.  deal to buy a 75% stake for $17.75 a share. The announcement comes less than a week after Forestar determined D.R. Horton's deal, which allows it to remain a publicly-traded company, was a "superior proposal" to Starwood's deal to pay $16.00 a share to take the company private. "Forestar's shareholders meaningfully benefit by receiving a superior and immediate cash premium for their shares, while also having the opportunity to retain a substantial stake in a company we are committed to growing into a leading residential land development platform with national scale," said D.R. Horton Chairman Donald Horton. The stock was trading 4.8% below the D.R. Horton's per-share bid price ahead of Thursday's open, but was 5.6% above Starwood's bid price. It has soared 31% year to date through Wednesday, while D.R. Horton shares have rallied 25%, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF  has climbed 14% and the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Forestar's stock surges as bidding war between D.R. Horton and Starwood continues
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  rallied 5.2% in premarket trade Friday, after the land development company said it determined that D.R. Horton Inc.'s  increased bid to buy 75% of the company was a "superior proposal" to its merger agreement with Starwood Capital Group. D.R. Horton had increased its bid to $17.75 a share in cash from its most-recent bid of $16.25 a share. Forestar also announced Friday that it had amended its merger deal with Starwood to increase the per-share bid to $16.00 a share in cash from the most-recent deal of $15.50 announced Wednesday, and up from the original bid of $14.25 a share. The termination fee of the Starwood deal is $20 million. Forestar said its agreement with Starwood permits Forestart to discuss the deal further through June 28. Forestar's stock has rallied 24% year to date through Thursday, while D.R. Horton shares have climbed 22% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Forestar to further consider D.R. Horton proposal, which could be 'superior' to Starwood's bid
Forestar Group Inc.  said Thursday that D.R. Horton Inc.'s  unsolicited bid to buy a 75% stake in the company could lead to a "superior proposal," as defined in its merger agreement with Starwood Capital Group. Forestar said that while it remains subject to the merger agreement with Starwood, the agreement allows Forestar to take certain actions to further consider D.R. Horton's bid, including participating in discussions or negotiations. The termination fee of the Starwood deal is $20 million. On April 13, Forestar agreed to be acquired by Starwood for $14.25 a share, but then received on June 5 a bid from D.R. Horton to buy 75% of the outstanding shares for $16.25 a share. Forestar's stock, which rallied 1% in premarket trade, has soared 19% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Forestar's stock soars after D.R. Horton offers to buy 75% stake at a premium to Starwood's buyout bid
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  soared 12% in premarket trade Monday, after D.R. Horton Inc.  proposed buying 75% of the real estate development company for $16.25 a share, which is 14% above Starwood Capital Group's buyout bid the company agreed to in April. D.R. Horton said under terms of its proposed deal, Forestar would remain a public company. Forestar shareholders can elect to receive $16.25 a share in cash for each Forestar share they own, or retain their shares of the remaining company. "We believe that D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to make Forestar the country's leading residential land development company," said D.R. Horton Chairman Donald Horton. "Together, we can grow Forestar into a much more significant and valuable company for all of its stockholders." On April 13, Forestar agreed to be acquired by private Starwood for $14.25 a share in cash, valuing Forestar at $605 million. Forestar's stock has climbed 6.8% year to date through Friday, while D.R. Horton shares have rallied 24% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

Forestar Group Inc. is a real estate, oil and gas, and other natural resources company based in Austin, Texas. The company owns directly or through ventures almost 120,000 acres (49,000 ha) of real estate located in ten states and 13 markets, approximately 590,000 acres of oil and gas mineral interests and approximately 358,000 net acres of leasehold oil and gas interests.[1]

Overview[edit]
The company operates three business segments: Real Estate, Oil and Gas, and Other Natural Resources.
The real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on its lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities, and develops multi-family apartments. Forestar invests in new projects in strategic growth corridors, which represent markets with significant growth characteristics for population, employment and household formation that make them attractive for long-term real estate investment.
The real estate segment has 11 real estate projects representing approximately 24,400 acres currently in the entitlement process, and 73 projects entitled, developed, or under development in eight states and 13 markets. The company sells land for commercial uses to national retailers and local commercial developers. In addition, the company will sell its undeveloped land, principally in Georgia, when it has reached its highest and best use. The company markets land for sale on its web site.[2]
The oil and gas segment is focused on driving exploration and production activity in high quality, lower risk conventional and unconventional oil and gas prospects on its fee and leasehold mineral interests. Leasehold interests include acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Forestar also seeks to maximize the value from royalties and other lease revenues from its fee oil and gas mineral interests located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
Other natural resources includes the sale of wood fiber, primarily in Georgia, and manages the company’s recreational leases, and approximately 1.5 million acres of groundwater resources including a 45% nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes from approximately 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama and about 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in Central Texas.
Company history[edit]
The company’s origins date back to the 1955 incorporation of Lumbermen’s Investment Corporation, which in 2006 changed its name to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group Inc. The company has a long legacy of residential and commercial real estate development operations, primarily in Texas. In 1991, Forestar and Cousins Properties Incorporated[3] formed Temco Associates, LLC as a venture to develop residential sites in Paulding County, Georgia, and in 2002 Forestar and Cousins formed CL Realty, L.L.C. as a venture to develop residential and mixed-use communities in Texas and across the southeastern U.S. Those ventures continue today. In 2001, Forestar opened an office in the Atlanta area to manage nearby land with a focus on its long-term real estate development potential. In 2006, Temple-Inland Inc. began reporting Forestar Real Estate Group as a separate business segment. On December 28, 2007, Temple-Inland distributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Forestar’s common stock to its shareholders. In September 2012, Forestar acquired CREDO Petroleum, an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with leasehold interests in over 135,000 net mineral acres.

Forestar terminates Starwood merger deal to go with D.R. Horton's stock purchase deal
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  fell 3.2% in premarket trade Thursday, after the land developer terminated its merger deal with Starwood Capital Group, so it could go with the D.R. Horton Inc.  deal to buy a 75% stake for $17.75 a share. The announcement comes less than a week after Forestar determined D.R. Horton's deal, which allows it to remain a publicly-traded company, was a "superior proposal" to Starwood's deal to pay $16.00 a share to take the company private. "Forestar's shareholders meaningfully benefit by receiving a superior and immediate cash premium for their shares, while also having the opportunity to retain a substantial stake in a company we are committed to growing into a leading residential land development platform with national scale," said D.R. Horton Chairman Donald Horton. The stock was trading 4.8% below the D.R. Horton's per-share bid price ahead of Thursday's open, but was 5.6% above Starwood's bid price. It has soared 31% year to date through Wednesday, while D.R. Horton shares have rallied 25%, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF  has climbed 14% and the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Forestar's stock surges as bidding war between D.R. Horton and Starwood continues
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  rallied 5.2% in premarket trade Friday, after the land development company said it determined that D.R. Horton Inc.'s  increased bid to buy 75% of the company was a "superior proposal" to its merger agreement with Starwood Capital Group. D.R. Horton had increased its bid to $17.75 a share in cash from its most-recent bid of $16.25 a share. Forestar also announced Friday that it had amended its merger deal with Starwood to increase the per-share bid to $16.00 a share in cash from the most-recent deal of $15.50 announced Wednesday, and up from the original bid of $14.25 a share. The termination fee of the Starwood deal is $20 million. Forestar said its agreement with Starwood permits Forestart to discuss the deal further through June 28. Forestar's stock has rallied 24% year to date through Thursday, while D.R. Horton shares have climbed 22% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Forestar to further consider D.R. Horton proposal, which could be 'superior' to Starwood's bid
Forestar Group Inc.  said Thursday that D.R. Horton Inc.'s  unsolicited bid to buy a 75% stake in the company could lead to a "superior proposal," as defined in its merger agreement with Starwood Capital Group. Forestar said that while it remains subject to the merger agreement with Starwood, the agreement allows Forestar to take certain actions to further consider D.R. Horton's bid, including participating in discussions or negotiations. The termination fee of the Starwood deal is $20 million. On April 13, Forestar agreed to be acquired by Starwood for $14.25 a share, but then received on June 5 a bid from D.R. Horton to buy 75% of the outstanding shares for $16.25 a share. Forestar's stock, which rallied 1% in premarket trade, has soared 19% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Forestar's stock soars after D.R. Horton offers to buy 75% stake at a premium to Starwood's buyout bid
Shares of Forestar Group Inc.  soared 12% in premarket trade Monday, after D.R. Horton Inc.  proposed buying 75% of the real estate development company for $16.25 a share, which is 14% above Starwood Capital Group's buyout bid the company agreed to in April. D.R. Horton said under terms of its proposed deal, Forestar would remain a public company. Forestar shareholders can elect to receive $16.25 a share in cash for each Forestar share they own, or retain their shares of the remaining company. "We believe that D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to make Forestar the country's leading residential land development company," said D.R. Horton Chairman Donald Horton. "Together, we can grow Forestar into a much more significant and valuable company for all of its stockholders." On April 13, Forestar agreed to be acquired by private Starwood for $14.25 a share in cash, valuing Forestar at $605 million. Forestar's stock has climbed 6.8% year to date through Friday, while D.R. Horton shares have rallied 24% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Sector Rank assigns a rating to each of the 16 Sectors based on their average Zacks Rank.
A sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.
