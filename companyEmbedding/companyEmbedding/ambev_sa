Main article: Anheuser-Busch InBev
Ambev, formally Companhia de Bebidas das Américas (official English translation: "Americas' Beverage Company", hence the name "Ambev", formerly styled as "AmBev") is a Brazilian brewing company. It is the biggest brewery in Latin America and the fifth in the world. It was created on July 1, 1999, with the merger of two breweries, Brahma and Antarctica. The merger was approved by the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) on March 30, 2000. The headquarters are in São Paulo, Brazil.
Ambev operates in 14 countries in the Americas and its product portfolio includes beers such as Antarctica, Bogotá Beer Company, Brahma, Bohemia, Skol, Stella Artois and soft drinks like Guaraná Antarctica, Soda Antarctica, Sukita and the innovations H2OH! and Guarah. The largest PepsiCo bottler outside United States, it sells and distributes PepsiCo products in Brazil and other Latin American countries, includes Pepsi, Lipton Ice Tea and Gatorade by franchise agreement. According to an analyst at Share Market Updates in October 2016, the company operates "through Latin America North, Latin America South, and Canada segments. It offers beers primarily under the Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica brands. The company also provides carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, isotonic beverages, energy drinks, and ready-to-drink teas under the Guaraná Antarctica, Guaraná Antarctica Black, Gatorade, H2OH!, Lipton Iced Tea, Fusion, Monster, Red Rock, Pepsi-Cola, and Seven Up brands."
Ambev S.A. is a subsidiary of Interbrew International B.V., which is in turn a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.[2]

American Beverage Corporation





 

 
 













                  About ABC                











Daily's orange juice was originally made from
			oranges squeezed by the company's owners themselves.


Founded as Daily Orange Juice Company, Inc. in 1960, American Beverage Corporation (ABC) began as a small company that manufactured and delivered orange juice products door-to-door in the Pittsburgh suburb of Verona, PA. As other juice flavors were added, the company name was changed to Daily Juice Products.
ABC is still headquartered in Verona, PA, but over the past 50 years, we have grown to become a multi-million dollar manufacturer and marketer of ready to drink cocktails, non-alcoholic cocktail mixers and fruit drinks. Our brands include Daily's Cocktails, Little Hug Fruit Barrels, Big Hug, and Guzzler and are nationally distributed in grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs and liquor stores. We also sell Daily's Cocktails products through food service distributors to bars and restaurants.
All ABC employees are committed to total customer satisfaction and are dedicated to the continuous innovation and improvement of our products and operating systems. With manufacturing facilities in Verona, PA and Phoenix, AZ, ABC maintains state-of-the-art manufacturing including bottle blow molding expertise.









Sustainability
American Beverage Corporation is dedicated to protecting and preserving the environment and we have implemented a number of sustainability policies and initiatives. We rigorously comply with all local, state and federal governmental regulations while employing state-of-the-art technology to help manage and sustain our resources and reduce waste.

		ABC recycles all paper, plastic, corrugate and metal scrap, along with incoming packaging containers to reduce trash in our landfills.

		All ABC bottles are 100% recyclable.

		ABC participates in an electric program that not only aids the environment, but also helps protect our community from brown outs and black outs and helps stabilize electric rates.

		All ABC packaging suppliers participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), where members agree to use environmentally responsible practices that promote the protection of wildlife, plants, soil, water, biodiversity, and air quality; while perpetuating the growing and harvesting of trees.

		ABC has a rigorous charitable donation program to reduce the waste of products that while fit for consumption, have shorter than standard expiry or do not meet our high standard for packaging. Rather than throw out products with cosmetic packaging flaws, we donate them to various charities.

 I opened my Daily’s frozen pouch and did not drink all of it – can I refreeze the pouch? 
 Yes, you may refreeze our Daily’s pouches after opening them.
  

 How do I know if my Daily’s pouch is still fresh? Is there an expiration code? 
 You can determine the freshness of Daily’s frozen pouches by reading the product code that is printed on the back of the pouch. The product code is printed in a format similar to the following:

	13032 VT 5¢
	0930 V 14A
Please refer to the information below to determine the freshness of your product.

	13 = year product manufactured (first 2 digits)
	032 = day in a 365-day year (digits 3-5)
	VT5¢ = internal use

	0930 = time
	V = plant location
	14A = internal use
If you have further questions regarding the freshness of your product, please contact us or call 412-828-9020 x 6150.
  

 What is the source of alcohol in Daily’s pre-mixed cocktails?  
 All Daily’s Pre-mixed Cocktails, including the frozen pouches, have the alcohol already in them. The source of alcohol is wine with appropriate flavors added to make each cocktail perfectly delicious! They are ready whenever you are…no mixing, measuring, or blending required. Just pour and enjoy!
  

 Do the Daily’s Cocktails contain sulfites? 
 No, none of the Daily’s Cocktails contain sulfites.
  

 What is the suggested freeze time for Daily's Frozen Pouches? 
 We recommend that frozen pouches be placed in the coldest section of the freezer for a minimum of 8 hours. Our pouches are designed to freeze upright or horizontally at the typical temperature of a household freezer, which is zero degrees Fahrenheit.
  

 Are your frozen pouches sold in the freezer sections of liquor stores? 
 Typically our pouches are sold on shelf or on a rack or display in stores and need to be frozen after purchase. But some stores do sell them in the freezer case. To find a retailer near you, please check out our new store locator.
  

 What are the Weight Watchers PointsPlus values for Daily's Cocktails ready to drink products? 
 With Weight Watchers, participants lose weight by creating a calorie deficit. Participants follow the PointsPlus system, which takes into account a food's protein, carbs, fat, and fiber. Using the Weight Watcher's calculator, each 10 oz Daily's Classic or Tropical Frozen Pouch has a point value of 5.
  

 What is the source of the maltodextrin in Daily’s products? 
 The maltodextrin we use in Daily’s products is derived from corn. If your food allergies require more details to determine whether you can safely consume Daily’s products, please use the contact form to send us a question.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Main article: Anheuser-Busch InBev
Ambev, formally Companhia de Bebidas das Américas (official English translation: "Americas' Beverage Company", hence the name "Ambev", formerly styled as "AmBev") is a Brazilian brewing company. It is the biggest brewery in Latin America and the fifth in the world. It was created on July 1, 1999, with the merger of two breweries, Brahma and Antarctica. The merger was approved by the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) on March 30, 2000. The headquarters are in São Paulo, Brazil.
Ambev operates in 14 countries in the Americas and its product portfolio includes beers such as Antarctica, Bogotá Beer Company, Brahma, Bohemia, Skol, Stella Artois and soft drinks like Guaraná Antarctica, Soda Antarctica, Sukita and the innovations H2OH! and Guarah. The largest PepsiCo bottler outside United States, it sells and distributes PepsiCo products in Brazil and other Latin American countries, includes Pepsi, Lipton Ice Tea and Gatorade by franchise agreement. According to an analyst at Share Market Updates in October 2016, the company operates "through Latin America North, Latin America South, and Canada segments. It offers beers primarily under the Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica brands. The company also provides carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, isotonic beverages, energy drinks, and ready-to-drink teas under the Guaraná Antarctica, Guaraná Antarctica Black, Gatorade, H2OH!, Lipton Iced Tea, Fusion, Monster, Red Rock, Pepsi-Cola, and Seven Up brands."
Ambev S.A. is a subsidiary of Interbrew International B.V., which is in turn a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.[2]

Main article: Anheuser-Busch InBev
Ambev, formally Companhia de Bebidas das Américas (official English translation: "Americas' Beverage Company", hence the name "Ambev", formerly styled as "AmBev") is a Brazilian brewing company. It is the biggest brewery in Latin America and the fifth in the world. It was created on July 1, 1999, with the merger of two breweries, Brahma and Antarctica. The merger was approved by the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) on March 30, 2000. The headquarters are in São Paulo, Brazil.
Ambev operates in 14 countries in the Americas and its product portfolio includes beers such as Antarctica, Bogotá Beer Company, Brahma, Bohemia, Skol, Stella Artois and soft drinks like Guaraná Antarctica, Soda Antarctica, Sukita and the innovations H2OH! and Guarah. The largest PepsiCo bottler outside United States, it sells and distributes PepsiCo products in Brazil and other Latin American countries, includes Pepsi, Lipton Ice Tea and Gatorade by franchise agreement. According to an analyst at Share Market Updates in October 2016, the company operates "through Latin America North, Latin America South, and Canada segments. It offers beers primarily under the Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica brands. The company also provides carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, isotonic beverages, energy drinks, and ready-to-drink teas under the Guaraná Antarctica, Guaraná Antarctica Black, Gatorade, H2OH!, Lipton Iced Tea, Fusion, Monster, Red Rock, Pepsi-Cola, and Seven Up brands."
Ambev S.A. is a subsidiary of Interbrew International B.V., which is in turn a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
