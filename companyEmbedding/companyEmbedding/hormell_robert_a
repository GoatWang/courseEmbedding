        Good Taste
The first time I bought it I thought it would not taste like corned beef hash, because it was canned. It turned out to be very good. It shrinks a little more than a little in size when cooked to perfection, but that was half the can getting smaller if I wanted I could have cooked the whole can. It is good.

        Very good
This is the only brand of corned beef hash I will buy. It is consistantly delicious even though it's from a can. Don't be fooled...this is good stuff!

        I bought a bad batch maybe?
I have bought this for years and never had a problem until today. I was actually able to poor the hash into the skillet. (2 cans). I knew it wouldn't fry up. I don't know what happen it is normally very firm as you need a spoon to get it out of the can. It was more like hash soup. I will still buy this in hopes that it doesn't turn out like this again.

        Bad batch
Normally your hash is wonderful, but today opened up two cans and they were totally mushy, not packed tight like usual. Both cans went down the drain. They wouldn't fry up.  Numbers on the lid are EST199W  BO2186-ES. We will continue to buy this product but thought you would want to know about it.

        Unable to open multiple cans
By far best tasting hash I've tried however lately I cannot open them. I've bought and wasted money on multiple can openers, hurt my hand, and still the lids one break. Waste of money.

        Usually the best but
I recently purchased 10 cans from a major retailer because I love this stuff. I have opened 4 cans so far and 2 of them were green on the bottom portion and one was turning brown. I ended up throwing them away . I was very disappointed and upset that I wasted almost $10.00 on those cans. Now I'm afraid to open the other cans because of this. I wish I had thought to take a photo of the discoloration and green coloring.The quality had definitely slipped in this production run.

        Breakfast with a bang!
There is nothing better than getting up with my son and making us a can of Hormel's, Mary Kitchen, Corned Beef Hash, with some eggs!  Not only did it fill us up and get us ready for a long day of hunting but was also very fast and easy to prepare and it also tasted excellent!  Needless to say, I went to our grocery store and bought more!  Now I just need to find it by the case!  Thanks for the great product!

        Good quality hash! maybe a bad pickup?
Hey! As a man who eats a can of this a day with my eggs and toast for breakfast, i can confidently say, this is the best corned beef hash i have ever had. Unfortunate when i picked it up at my local stop n shop, i eagerly opened it up to a half empty can with mold in it. i hope this doesnt happen again :(

Presbyterian Senior Living, Inc.

                    Presbyterian Senior Living Communities have the strength of a relatively large organization and the financial resources to provide the security that older adults expect from an organization that promises to be there for as long as needed. Their individual communities, however, offer a range of sizes and reflect their commitment to the personal touch. They are places where the staff can know each resident as an individual, and where residents’ likes and dislikes are recognized and accommodated whenever possible. Being not-for-profit gives their organization the freedom to concentrate on the needs of residents first. While for-profit corporations have the dual responsibility of providing care for residents, as well as satisfying the needs of investors, they can remain more sharply focused on meeting the needs of residents. They believe that the ability to express these higher values also enables them to attract employees and volunteers with similar values.
