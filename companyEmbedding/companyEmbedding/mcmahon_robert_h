Major General (Retired) Robert H. McMahon And John D. Houser Elected To State Bank Financial Corporation Board Of Directors






GlobeNewswire

    ATLANTA and MACON, Ga., Oct. 2, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Major General (Retired) Robert H. McMahon and John D. Houser have been elected to the board of directors of State Bank Financial Corporation. McMahon was also elected to the board of directors of State Bank and Trust Company, where Houser continues to serve.

Robins Air Force Base is the largest employer in Middle Georgia and the largest single-site employer in the state. The base employs approximately 23,000 people, including 7,000 military members. State Bank has the largest share of combined bank deposits of any financial institution in the Middle Georgia markets we serve.  McMahon is the President/CEO of the 21 st Century Partnership in Warner Robins, GA. The Partnership is a community-based organization focused on enhancing the military value of Robins Air Force Base. Immediately prior to retirement, General McMahon served as Commander of the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA. The center is one of three Air Force air logistics centers and the largest single-site industrial complex in the state of Georgia. McMahon was born in Toledo, Ohio. He entered active duty after graduation from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978.  "Businesses and residents of Middle Georgia and those serving at Robins Air Force Base are important clients for State Bank," said Evans. "Maj. Gen. McMahon has a unique understanding of this community and he will help State Bank in its commitment to provide best-in-class service to all its customers."
