Our Management
Our senior management team averages approximately 25 years of industry experience. We have specific expertise across all aspects of the ethanol supply, production and distribution chain—from agribusiness, to plant operations and management, to commodity markets, to ethanol marketing and distribution. We believe the level of operational and financial expertise of our management team will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies. Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent and will devote the portion of such member’s time to our business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct our operations.

Our Company




Our primary business objectives are to maintain stable and predictable cash flows and to increase our quarterly cash distribution per unit over time. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following business strategies: 





Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows. We intend to generate stable and predictable cash flows over time by providing fee-based logistics services. As we grow our business beyond our current assets and operations, we will seek to enter into similar fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows. 
Pursue Attractive Organic Growth Opportunities. We intend to enhance the profitability of our initial assets by pursuing, individually or with our parent, organic growth projects. For example, we believe certain expansion projects that may be implemented by our parent at its ethanol production plants would enable us to utilize the strategic location and capacity of our assets and would increase annual throughput at our facilities. We believe our capital expenditures associated with such potential expansion projects would be minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate growth in our parent’s throughput. In addition, we expect to collaborate with our parent and other potential third-party customers to identify other growth opportunities to construct assets and build businesses that will enable them to pursue their business strategies while providing us with stable cash flows through fee-based service agreements. 

Pursue Accretive Acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic, accretive acquisitions of complementary assets from our parent and third parties. We intend to continually monitor the marketplace, individually and in conjunction with our parent, to identify and pursue asset acquisitions from third parties that complement or diversify our existing operations. We expect to pursue both ethanol and other fuel storage and terminal assets, initially focusing on assets in close geographic proximity to our existing asset base. 

Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining the safety, reliability, environmental compliance and efficiency of our operations. All of our assets are staffed by experienced industry personnel. We, along with our parent, will also continue to focus on incremental operational improvements to enhance overall production results. We will seek to improve our operating performance through commitment to our preventive maintenance program along with employee training, safety and development programs. We believe these objectives are integral to maintaining stable cash flows and critical to the success of our business. 

Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility. We intend to maintain financial strength and flexibility, which should enable us to pursue acquisitions and new growth opportunities as they arise. We believe that our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets after this offering will provide us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic and accretive acquisition growth strategies.

	Green Plains is a vertically integrated ethanol producer based in Omaha, Nebraska. We currently have an ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year with our 17 plants strategically located across the U.S. We also operate an independent third party ethanol marketing business, Green Plains Trade.

Distillers grains are an important co-product of Green Plains’ ethanol production. At capacity our plants will produce approximately 4.1 million tons of distillers grains annually that will be used as a high-protein, high-energy animal fodder and feed supplement. Corn oil is also a co-product of ethanol production that is being extracted at all of our plants. Corn oil is sold to biodiesel manufacturers and to feed lot and poultry markets.

	Green Plains also provides grain storage through our Subsidiary – Green Plains Grain. Green Plains Grain has grain storage capacity of approximately 58 million bushels, including on-site storage at our ethanol plants, that is used to support our grain merchandising activities, as well as our ethanol plant operations. We believe that incorporating this business segment into our operations increases efficiencies and reduces commodity price and supply risks.

	Looking to next generation technology, Green Plains is part of a joint venture called BioProcess Algae to commercialize algae production technology. In addition to Green Plains, the other partners in the venture are CLARCOR Inc. and BioProcess H2O. The project, located at Green Plains in Shenandoah, Iowa, received a grant from the Iowa Office of Energy Independence totaling $4.1 million.

Ethanol is a clean-burning, high-octane motor fuel that is produced from renewable sources. At its most basic, 
				ethanol is grain alcohol, produced from crops such as corn. Because it is domestically produced, ethanol helps reduce America's 
				dependence upon foreign sources of energy and creates green jobs in rural areas of the country.

Investor Overview





	Founded in 2004, Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRE) is North America's third largest producer of ethanol. Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, Green Plains has grown rapidly, primarily through acquisitions, and today has operating segments throughout the ethanol value chain.

	Our operations begin upstream with our grain handling segment, continue through our approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity per year, and ends downstream with our product marketing and distribution. We focus on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and our risk management strategy. We believe that owning and operating assets throughout the ethanol value chain enables us to mitigate the effects of changes in commodity prices on our profitability and differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production.

	Ethanol

Ethanol is a chemical produced by the fermentation of sugars found in grains and other biomass.

	Ethanol can be produced from a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, as well as from agricultural waste products such as rice hulls, cheese whey, potato waste, brewery and beverage wastes and forestry and paper wastes. At present, the majority of ethanol in the U.S. is produced from corn because corn contains large quantities of carbohydrates and is in greater supply than other grains. Such carbohydrates convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass.

	Green Plains was formed in June 2004 to construct and operate dry mill, fuel-grade ethanol production plants. Ethanol is a renewable, environmentally clean fuel source that is produced at numerous facilities in the United States, mostly in the Midwest. In the U.S., ethanol is produced primarily from corn and then blended with unleaded gasoline in varying percentages. The ethanol industry in the U.S. has grown significantly over the last few years as its use reduces harmful auto emissions, enhances octane ratings of the gasoline with which it is blended, offers consumers a cost-effective choice, and decreases the amount of crude oil the U.S. needs to import from foreign sources. Ethanol is most commonly sold as E10, the 10 percent blend of ethanol for use in all American automobiles. Increasingly, ethanol is also available as E85, a higher percentage ethanol blend for use in flexible fuel vehicles.

	Operations commenced at our first ethanol plant, located in Shenandoah, Iowa, in late August 2007; the next ethanol plant, located in Superior, Iowa, commenced operations in July 2008; the third ethanol plant to come online is located in Bluffton, Indiana, and began producing ethanol in September 2008; our next ethanol plant to begin production is located in Obion, Tennessee. and had its first grind in November 2008. On July 2, 2009, we acquired two ethanol plants located in Nebraska. The plants are located in Central City and Ord and add 150 million gallons of ethanol production capacity per year. On October 22, 2010, we acquired two plants located in Riga, Michigan and Lakota, Iowa and on March 24, 2011 acquired a plant in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. We acquired our tenth plant in Atkinson, Nebraska in June of 2013. In November 2013 we acquired plants in Wood River, Nebraska and Fairmont, Minnesota. In October 2015, we acquired a plant in Hopewell, Virgina and in November 2015, we acquired an ethanol plant in Hereford, Texas. In September of 2016 we acquired plants in Madison, Illinois, Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska. At capacity, our 17 ethanol plants produce a total of approximately 1.5 billion gallons of fuel-grade ethanol annually, making Green Plains the second largest ethanol producer in the world.
