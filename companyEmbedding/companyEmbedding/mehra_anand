Anand Mehra
General Partner
MD
Anand joined Sofinnova in 2007 as a Principal. In 2014, he was promoted to General Partner. He focuses on working with entrepreneurs to build drug development companies that have the power to improve the lives of patients. Anand represents Sofinnova on the boards of Aclaris (ACRS), First Aid Shot Therapy, Merus, and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE). He led Sofinnova’s investments for Vicept Therapeutics (acquired by Allergan), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Aclaris (ACRS), Civitas (acquired by Acorda), Prothena (PRTA), and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE). He played an important role in the firm’s investments in Amarin (AMRN), Nextwave Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Pfizer), Preglem (acquired by Gideon Richter), and SarCode (acquired by Shire). 
Prior to joining Sofinnova, Anand worked at JP Morgan Partners in private equity and venture capital. Before joining the venture community, he was a consultant for McKinsey & Company’s healthcare practice, advising large pharmaceutical and biotech companies on core strategic issues. Anand has fourteen years of experience in biomedical research, consulting, and investing, and is the author of multiple peer-reviewed articles and abstracts. Frequently, he is an invited speaker on venture capital and industry panels. 
Anand received his MD from Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons.  He was an Echols Scholar and conducted National Institute of Health sponsored research on the outcomes, mechanisms, and pre-clinical development of therapeutic agents for stroke. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Virginia with a BA in Political Theory through the Government Honors program. While in college, he spent three years as a firefighter for the Seminole Trail Fire Department.

What are analysts saying about Spark Therapeutics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Spark Therapeutics stock: 
1. Chardan Capital analysts commented, "We continue to expect ENDP shares to be range-bound in the near to medium term. Our recent analysis of ENDP’s additional unfunded mesh liability and discussion with a legal expert familiar with mass tort/product liability defense ligation supports our view ENDP will remain highly levered (in the 4s) and the company’s turnaround will take several years. While we view any of our potential settlement scenarios for the company’s additional unfunded mesh liability to be manageable, we believe continued pricing pressure in ENDP’s US generics base business, need for additional advertising and promotion spend to support Xiaflex growth and inability to grow through meaningful acquisitions leave ENDP little room for error." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Spark Therapeutics, Inc. offers gene therapy. The Company's product candidate consist of SPK-RPE65, SPK-CHM, SPK-FIX which are in different clinical phases, for the treatment of additional blinding conditions, hematologic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Spark Therapeutics, Inc. is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.   " (7/19/2017)
3. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts commented, "2017 – Year of First Gene Therapy Approval in U.S.? Management reiterated its confidence in filing its rolling BLA in early 2017, and highlighted that the company has completed the necessary manufacturing runs to support its submission. Outstanding items for the filing include finalization of stability testing and CMC module write-up. We believe the timing of the filing could lead to the first approved gene therapy in the U.S. this year and remind investors that the FDA previously amended its granted orphan designation for voretigene neparvovec to cover inherited retinal diseases caused by biallelic RPE65 mutations." (2/23/2017)
4. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "Management's 4Q16 earnings announcement/call contained minimally-incremental insight on many of the data catalysts still anticipated for 1H17. We believe management's commentary around the current state of pre-commercialization activities for voretigene neparvovec (VN) ' including directionally positive feedback on both the access and reimbursement fronts ' should ameliorate some of the near-term concerns of those investors anticipating pricing/reimbursement to potentially represent a source of headline risk. We believe anticipation around a number of key near-term data catalysts ' including early-FY17 SPK-7001 data in choroideremia, updated early-April SPK-9001 data in hemophilia B, and preliminary mid-FY17 SPK-8011 data ' should keep ONCE shares at the forefront of relevancy over the coming months. Estimates largely unchanged." (2/23/2017)
