Dominic J. Frederico
President and Chief Executive Officer
Dominic Frederico is President and Chief Executive Officer of Assured Guaranty Ltd., a position he has held since December 2003. During his tenure, Assured Guaranty became the leading provider of municipal bond insurance and financial guarantees. Assured Guaranty completed its initial public offering in 2004 under his leadership, and, in 2009, acquired the financial guaranty insurance company now named Assured Guaranty Municipal, thereby merging the only two monoline insurers to continue writing policies before, during and after the Great Recession.
Mr. Frederico has supervised the operations of Assured Guaranty since its acquisition in 1999 by ACE Limited, where he was Vice Chairman, and also served as Chairman of ACE Financial Services, ACE INA and ACE USA. He worked at ACE for nine years prior to his post at Assured Guaranty, progressing to increasingly senior positions, including: President & CEO, ACE Bermuda; Chairman, President & CEO, ACE INA Holdings; and President & Chief Operating Officer, ACE Limited. He oversaw the successful acquisition and integration of the domestic and international property casualty operations acquired by ACE from CIGNA Corporation in July 1999 and the acquisition of Capital Re Corp., the predecessor company to Assured Guaranty, in December 1999.
Prior to joining ACE, Mr. Frederico spent 13 years working for various subsidiaries of the American International Group.
Mr. Frederico holds an M.B.A. in Finance and a B.S. from Drexel University, as well as a Certified Public Accountant’s designation in the State of Pennsylvania. In addition to his professional responsibilities, he is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
