			BALTIMORE, Md., 
			July 19, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	​Protenus, the healthcare industry’s most robust, analytics-driven solution for protecting patient privacy and preventing health data breaches, today announced a $3M extension of its Series A funding round, led by Kaiser Permanente Ventures with participation from F-Prime Capital Partners and existing investor LionBird Venture Partners. The new investment will be used to bolster its industry-leading product, expand product offerings and accelerate sales growth.
As most hospitals have transitioned to electronic health records, patient data has never been more vulnerable. In 2016, over 27 million patient records were breached, as noted by the Protenus Breach Barometer. So far, 2017 has averaged more than one health data breach per day, with over 40% of these incidents attributable to insiders.
Protenus uses advanced analytics to identify anomalous behaviors within a hospital’s electronic health records and associated systems. By leveraging an array of artificial intelligence techniques to build a comprehensive understanding of clinical and administrative workflows, Protenus detects when individuals inappropriately access patient data, ensuring trust throughout health data systems. Since its founding in 2014, Protenus has worked with premier healthcare systems and hospitals across the country, protecting the privacy of more than 44 million patients.

We founded Protenus with the mission of empowering hospitals to protect the privacy of their patients. We've built a solution that is a paradigm shift from how hospitals have typically met patient privacy monitoring needs using predictive analytics and big data frameworks. With this more modern approach, we've been able to tap into immense market growth while protecting the critical and trusted relationships hospitals have with their patients.

The company raised a $4M series A round in February 2016, and with this extension sought to bring in strategic and financial partners with expertise in healthcare and cybersecurity to propel its growth in the market.
"An investment from Kaiser Permanente Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners will support the company as we advance our efforts to bring this innovative next-generation solution to the patient privacy monitoring market," said Protenus co-founder and president, Robert Lord. "This support from two of the industry’s top institutional investors brings additional industry expertise to our team, and helps us meet the increasing demand for the Protenus platform."

whose principal executive office is located at 650 Townsend Street, Suite 380, San Francisco, California 94103.   


ITEM 2.
IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND  The persons filing this statement and the persons enumerated in response to
Instruction C of Schedule 13D, and the information regarding them are as follows:   


 
(a)
Kaiser Permanente Ventures, LLCSeries A, a Delaware limited liability company (KV-A); Kaiser Permanente Ventures  Series B, a Delaware limited liability company
(KV-B); The Permanente Federation  Series I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (PF-I); and The Permanente Federation  Series J, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (PF-J) (each a Filing Person and collectively, the Filing Persons).   


 
(b)
The business address of the Filing Persons is:  1 Kaiser Plaza, Suite 2243, Oakland, California
94612.   


 
(c)
Present principal occupation or employment of the Filing Persons and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted: 
KV-A and KV-B are investment vehicles used by affiliates of Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (KFH), a California nonprofit
corporation to own securities issued in connection with technology investments by KFH and its affiliates, and in this paragraph the term Ventures Filing Persons refers to those two investment vehicles. PF-I and PF-J are
investment vehicles used to own securities issued in connection with technology investments by Kaiser Permanente Medical Groups and certain of its affiliates, and in this paragraph PF-I and PF-J are referred to collectively as the
Federation Filing Persons). The Ventures Filing Persons, on the one hand, and the Federation Filing Persons, on the other hand, are managed by fully independent committees whose membership does not overlap and which are
appointed by separate, non-affiliated entities. However, from time to time the two management committees meet collectively and confer with respect to the acquisition, disposition and voting of securities owned by the several Filing Persons and
certain of their respective affiliates. There is no written or unwritten agreement between or among the Filing Persons relating to such voting power or dispositive power, and collective meetings may be discontinued or curtailed at any time.
Accordingly, each of the Ventures Filing Persons disclaims that it is acting in concert with respect to the voting and disposition of the securities held by each of the Federation Filing Persons, and vice versa, except to the extent described above.
  


 
(d)
During the last five years, none of the Filing Persons has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors). 
 


 
(e)
