Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EMCORE Corporation Fiscal First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Erica Mannion of Sapphire Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erica Mannion
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the information provided herein may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are largely based on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends affecting our business. Such forward-looking statements include in particular, projections about future results, statements about plans, strategies, business prospects, changes and trends in the business, and the markets in which we operate.
Management cautions that these forward-looking statements relate to future events or future financial performance and are subject to business, economic, and other risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the business or our industry to materially differ from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
We caution you not to rely on these statements and to also consider the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and the business that are included in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that are available on the SEC's Web site located at www.sec.gov, including the sections entitled Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
With me today from EMCORE are Jeff Rittichier, President and CEO; and Jikun Kim, Chief Financial Officer. Jikun will review the financial results and Jeff will discuss business highlights and fiscal second quarter guidance before we open up the call to questions.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jikun.
Jikun Kim
Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon everyone. Today I will provide details of our Q1 FY'17 financial performance. Please note that consistent with prior quarters, these results include the effects of classifying what remains of EMCORE's Telecom and Photovoltaic businesses as discontinued operations.
Consolidated revenue for the quarter totaled $30.2 million, which is 18% higher than the prior quarter and above the high-end of the revenue guidance of $28 million to $30 million.
Cable TV market continues to drive revenue both for our DOCSIS 3.1 and RF over Glass products. We also recognized phenomenal [ph] growth on our SatCom Video and Fiber Optic Gyro product lines. Our emerging chip products held steady in the quarter.
GAAP gross profits in Q1 were $10 million, which is 10% higher than the prior quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 33.3%, down from 35.6% in the prior quarter. The primary driver of the reduced gross margin during the quarter was a $350,000 accelerated spending related to the Beijing manufacturing transition efforts. On a non-GAAP basis, which takes into consideration adding back FAS 123R expenses as well as after-retirement obligation accruals our non-GAAP gross margin came in at 33.6%.

Normalizing for the effects of the accelerated Beijing facility transition expenses, our non-GAAP gross profit margins would have been closer to 34.8%. As Jeff will discuss further in a few moments, it is worth noting that our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in product mix and other non-recurring factors. Through our discussion last quarter, we remain focused on optimizing profitability at the operating income level versus gross profits.
Total GAAP operating expenses for R&D and SG&A were $7.8 million, approximately $400,000 higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, annual performance bonus accruals, and year-end audit fees, all offset by lower R&D investments during the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis adjusting for FAS 123R and other non-recurring items, operating expenses would have been flat. For further details please see the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table in the press release.
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the first quarter was $2.2 million, an increase of $500,000 over the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $3.5 million or 11.5% of revenue compared to $2.5 million or 9.9% of revenue in the prior quarter.
Normalizing for the effects of the accelerated Beijing facility transition expenses, our non-GAAP operating profit margins would have been closer to 12.7%, exceeding the operating margin target of 12.5% we discussed at the end of last quarter.
Our GAAP pretax income from continuing operation was $1.9 million in Q1, or $150,000 higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to higher gross profits offset by higher operating expenses and FX losses. Our non-GAAP pretax income after taking into consideration certain adjustments, all of which are set forth in the non-GAAP tables included in today's press release was $3.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $2.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the prior quarter.
Please note that we have included additional information regarding unique transactions, litigation-related expenditures, severance stock compensation, amortization, and other items in today's press release to provide further clarity on our results.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement; at the end of Q1 FY'17, the company's cash, cash equivalents were approximately $62.2 million. Moving on to the balance sheet -- I'm sorry, regarding our working capital metrics, DSOs were at 77 days, a slight increase from the 74 days in the prior quarter, driven by the timing of the shipments in the quarter. Net inventory turns including non-current inventory was at 2.7 times, slightly lower than the prior quarter. The increase in the inventory was driven by the build up of finished goods and the working process inventory ahead of the Chinese New Year and factory transition efforts.
In Q1 FY'17, we invested $3.2 million in capital expenditures and recognized approximately $750,000 in depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures remain elevated due to the Beijing facility transition and the investments that we are making in our laser file [ph].
In summary, we continue to make solid financial progress during the quarter with strong top line growth as market continues to adopt the DOCSIS 3.1 solutions. We are also beginning to realize the benefits of operational improvement initiatives we began a year ago. Taken in combination, our operations continues to grow profitability and meet our commitments.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Rittichier
Thanks, Jikun. Good afternoon everyone. As Jikun highlighted, we continued our momentum into the first fiscal quarter, delivering sequential revenue growth of 18%, which was at the high-end of our guidance.

More importantly, during the quarter we demonstrated our improved manufacturing efficiency and operating leverage by growing non-GAAP pretax net income sequentially by approximately 35%. With that said, I'd like to provide you with some additional color on the trends we are seeing in each of our served markets as well as in the operations of the business.
Within the Cable TV market, in the first quarter we continued to see strong sequential growth with the business up roughly 19% from the fourth quarter and up 91% from the prior year. The overall strength in infrastructure side of cable television not only demonstrates the MSO's commitment to deploying DOCSIS 3.1 Fiber Deep Networks, but also highlights EMCORE's leadership position within the space.
As we discussed last quarter, we believe we are still in the early innings of this network build-out, and are poised to benefit from our new products such as our LEML-based solutions, which are being integrated across our product lines. We remain optimistic about growth opportunities in this business, and expect to see strong upgrade spending for major and regional MSOs.
As we look to expand our addressable market within the Cable TV space with new products such as RF over Glass, it's worth reiterating that our focus is on opportunities which are accretive to overall corporate operating margin. In our RFoG products, sales, marketing, and engineering expense scaled down in lockstep with product margins. We expect to see a bit heavier mix of the low end of our RFoG product in Q2 driving revenue and non-GAAP net income up in dollars, but at the expense of the gross margin line.
Moving on to the Chip market, revenues remain flat in the first quarter, which we expected. We've begun production shipments of 10G parts at low volumes, and we're continuing our product development work to address the wireless and datacenter markets which we plan to enter toward the end of 2017. As we've stated previously, EMCORE is working to become broad supplier of chip-level products to the entire telecom industry, thereby optimizing our production mix between captive and merchant use, driving a higher blended margin for both our chip business and for the company overall. Within the SatCom and video markets EMCORE continues to enjoy strong market share and close relationships with customers in our legacy markets, while continuing to make progress on introducing new products for adjacent markets such as L-Band link used by services such as Dish and DirecTV.
As I highlighted last quarter, we're currently in the process of outsourcing our SatCom products to TAA, which is essentially Made in America, an ITAR compliant manufacturing facility operated by our EMS partners. This transition was largely complete by the end of the first quarter. We expect to see modest growth in the SatCom product line in fiscal '17. Within the Fiber Optic Gyro market we continue to make progress in building our presence in the market and winning designs against larger competitors in the defense industry.
In addition to the orders we publicly announced, we continue to see increasing momentum for potential new orders in the current fiscal year. In addition to delivering production product for the MTSB program and other key program, our primary emphasis this year is to deliver pre-production volume for very important new program that we expect move to revenue needle in FY '18.
We recently created an airspace and defense business unit and have brought a new VP General Manager with significant experience in the industry to manage this business. We will be retrofitting one of our Alhambra campus buildings to house key pieces of capital equipment by about the end of the calendar year. These upgrades are necessary to support the growing FOG IN new business, and we -- and remain expectations remain that we will exit the year with navigation product running at about 10% of revenue and higher thereafter.

Shifting gears to the operation side of the business, our transition to a hybrid EMS manufacturing model is nearly complete at the end of Q1, we have largely completed the shift of that car manufacturing to EMS suppliers, by the end of Q2, we will have finished the relocation of our assembly operation in Langfang, China to EMCORE Asia, which is our new automated facility inside the Beijing.
The new facility has been audited by all of our major customers at this point and we received nearly all of the customer approval for PCM. This means that the transition schedule is quite firm with very few moving parts, we expect to see some acceleration of expenses related to timing in certain activities over the next quarter or two that may push margins around a little bit, but we have included within the window of guidance our non-GAAP net income, I am sorry non-GAAP operating margin which are targeted at 12.5% as we exit Q4.
When completed these actions coupled with the numerous initiative, we continue to implement as a result of our Six Sigma Training program, we will have significantly transformed the operations of EMCORE from where things were nearly two years ago. From a personnel standpoint, our automation activities will have made us 180% more efficient on a cost to goods per employee basis, while our outsourcing initiative continue to transform fixed expense to variable costs as we focus on processes where we can demonstrably add value over competing merchant EMF. Perhaps the most significantly evolve these actions will result in the reduction of our breakeven point by $1 to $1.5 million per quarter.
Again, I would like to point out the unique aspect of our manufacturing strategy for Mixed Signal Optics. The automation processes and cable TV module assembly that are responsible for the dramatic improvement in our commercial business were designed to duel use in our military program, allowing us to drive cost reduction and quality improvement in our U.S. manufacturing operation, even though the equipment was originally developed by our team in China, you should expect to see more of this automation development from us going forward, as we strive to make our U.S. manufacturing operation capable of competing with offshore low costs labor.
As I mentioned before, Six Sigma is driving a new culture here at EMCORE. In a recent investor meeting, where we were discussing the savings, we have achieved one of our investors asked me whether all the low hanging fruit is now off the tree, I replied that indeed a lot of it has been harvested but the juiciest fruit of all was now within our reach because Six Sigma has thought the organization, how to climb the tree.
My point was that the problem solving skills in this organization have improved markedly and organization wide, making EMCORE able to tackle even more lucrative albeit challenging problem. We have actually moved all of our management training and evaluation processes out of HR into the quality organization and are treating management system and organizational development the same way, we treat every other process. Leading for being audited and improve the same way that we solved manufacturing process problem preparing the organization to manage its growth in a controlled and positive structure.
Turning to our outlook for the business, for the second fiscal quarter, given the continued strength we are seeing in the Cable TV business, we expect revenue to be in the range of $29 million to $31 million, with non-GAAP operating margin approximately 9.5% to 11.5%. It's worth noting that Q2 has traditionally been a seasonally soft quarter due to weather limitations. Our roughly flat guidance is significantly better than planned. Finally, we expect to hit the quarter with production almost -- end the quarter with production almost completely shifted over to our new EA facility, a key milestone in the evolution of EMCORE.

Now, I'll turn over the call to the operator to open up for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Joe Maxa of Dougherty and Company. Your line is open.
Joe Maxa
Thank you, and congrats on a nice quarter and outlook.
Jeff Rittichier
Thank you, Joe.
Joe Maxa
I wanted to ask a little more on your outlook on '17 on the Cable TV side of things. Cable TV is very strong, currently expected for Q2. I mean, from a lot of necessity [ph] with Comcast and others, but what are you seeing as far as perhaps new customers -- not customers, but MSOs building this year versus perhaps next year, and do you expect to see continued growth sequentially through the year?
Jeff Rittichier
Well, getting into the limitations of my crystal ball here, it's hard to say what sequential really means. I mean, Cable could be a little cyclical at times. So with that said, we see a strong backdrop of spending strength. If you look into the documentation that our friends at Charter had to file when they bought Bright House and Time Warner, indicate that in '17 they have to begin to build out additional, what is essentially, high speed capability in the Time Warner and Bright House networks. Charter has been real good about upgrading as well.
So, the net of it is if you look at what Charter is saying it looks like there's additional strength beyond Comcast, as you mentioned. Liberty Global is certainly doing its thing as it rolls up smaller regional MSOs over in Europe, and they have a very strong technology roadmap, so -- and not to -- last but not least, the Japanese are beginning in '17 to do a build-out to bring 8K transmission in for the 2020 Olympics.
So overall, we see strength throughout the industry. I'm sure there will be turbulence from time to time, things switch back and forth between infrastructure and CPE, but all indications are that the major MSOs are spending.
Joe Maxa
That's helpful, and I just want to probe a little more into your operating margins. I mean, you hit your existing fiscal year '17 number pick out [ph] one times on a non-GAAP basis of over 12.5%, guided down in Q2, I know you have some moving parts. Can you walk through again the drivers of that difference of maybe that 9.5% to 11.5% Op margin for Q2?
Jikun Kim
Sure. So, just the pure non-GAAP reconciliation in the back I would refer to in 11.5% Q1 performance, and then obviously the Beijing transition cost would add about $350,000 in costs which would get you up to the 12.7% Op margin. The transition at Beijing is not over. It's just begun. So this is -- we anticipate that cost in Q2 to be the highest. So that's one factor. And then we are going to see a higher mix of the archived products which will definitely impact the operating profit performance a little bit. So I think we're being probably about right at 9.5% to 11.5%. That seems to be a good range and good number, but keep in mind we should come out of that in Q3 relatively stronger.
Joe Maxa
Understood. All right, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Jeff Rittichier
Yes, Joe, the other little piece is that essentially all the processes will be running in EA within another three weeks. So there's redundancy to get stripped out and everything, but this is not something that is way out at the end of our headlights.
Joe Maxa
Just that piece of the business, that transition over in China, once that's complete how do you -- I mean you said $1 million to $1.5 million reduction in breakeven, is that primarily driven by that operations?
Jeff Rittichier
Yes, there's also -- also there will be some changes in the operations here in Alhambra that will contribute. Keep in mind though that what we're talking about is a reduction in breakeven point. So some of the savings essentially go to variable costs which we have to pay third parties to do it, but the good news is that it makes us drought resistant of course if the market ever does slow down.

Joe Maxa
Great, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from Jaeson Schmidt of Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.
Jaeson Schmidt
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on one of the previous questions, not looking for specific guidance, but historically you've seen sequential growth in both the June and September quarters, and after a really strong December and March this fiscal year. Is there anything that you currently see that would not allow that trend to continue?
Jeff Rittichier
Well, hi, Jaeson, it's Jeff. So here's the thing. Normally we start to see signs of a slowdown in, let's call it, the winter quarter, our Q2, calendar Q1, a couple of months ahead of schedule or a couple of months ahead of when it actually hits, and we didn't see as much of it. There's been the odd push out here and there which actually ended up pushing the market numbers around just a bit already.
The point of it is that you don't really see indications about where calendar Q2 and calendar Q3 end up until about the middle of March. And that's when it seems like everybody wakes up and starts expediting things. So again, we see a very strong pattern of spend, and there's nothing out there that makes us think that there's an oncoming train headed at us. But you never know really on the slightly longer view until you hit mid-March, and see what quarters look like.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting to the Fiber Gyro side, that's obviously a big area of focus for you guys going forward, can you help us understand how you're breaking into that market, what gives you guys confidence that you can see continued traction going forward?
Jeff Rittichier
Sure, great question. So it's funny because the Fiber Gyros we have been working on some of this technology for a very long time. We've now been in production with [indiscernible] MTSD [ph] program for two years, may be a bit more, and we are one of their top supplier, as has been acknowledged through their award system. We are working on other programs for them. And as our success has become clear though the industry we're getting pulled in to bid on things that two years ago, when I joined, people wouldn't have considered us for. So it's a competitive world out there, Jaeson, which is why you haven't seen a ton of press releases. But we like where we are now. The customer relationships that pull us into these programs, which are absolutely critical, we feel that we have, and that we're getting good traction. So not a lot of specifics in that, but we wouldn't be starting to work on expanding our production capacity if we didn't like what we saw going forward.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay, thanks. I'll jump back into queue.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Not showing any further questions at this time. I'm sorry; it looks like we have an additional question from Joe Maxa of Dougherty and Company. Your line is open.
Joe Maxa
I'd ask for the revenue breakout, like you've given each quarter on your segments.
Jikun Kim
Yes, sure. So, on the Cable TV side we were at 80% to 85% of the revenues. On the chip side we're at 2.5% to 7.5%, in the SatCom Video we're at 5% to 10% and on t [indiscernible] 2.5% to 5%. So, the mix really didn't change very much from last quarter.
Joe Maxa
Great. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.
Jikun Kim
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And I'm not showing any additional questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jeff Rittichier for any further remarks.
Jeff Rittichier
Thank you. In closing, I would like to thank my team for the very hard work they put in everyday, and I believe I speak for everyone when I say how we proud we are of the business we are building and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you all for your time today.

With me today from EMCORE are Jeff Rittichier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jikun Kim, Chief Financial Officer. Jikun will review the financial results, and Jeff will discuss business highlights and fiscal third quarter guidance before we open the call up to questions.
Now, I will turn the call over to Jikun.
Jikun Kim
Thank you, Erica. Today, I will provide the details of our Q2 FY17 financial performance. Please note that consistent with prior quarters, these results include the effects of classifying what remains of EMCORE's Telecom and Photovoltaic businesses as discontinued operations.
Consolidated revenue for the quarter totaled $32.6 million, which is 8% higher than the prior quarter and above the high end of the revenue guidance of $29 million to $31 million. Cable-TV market continues to drive revenues for both our DOCSIS 3.1 and RF over Glass products. DOCSIS 3.1 product revenues held steady relative to Q1 in what has been historically a seasonally low quarter. RF over Glass product revenues increased significantly from a small base relative to the prior quarter. Our merchant ship products also showed the strongest performance over the past 4 quarters with solid gross margins.
We also recognized nominal growth for our Satcom video product line. The Fiber Optic Gyro came in lower than prior quarter driven by the timing of customer orders. GAAP gross profit in Q2 was $11 million, which is 10% higher than the prior quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 33.9%, up from 33.3% in the prior quarter. As we discussed on our last call, the combination of higher RF over Glass revenue mix and spending related to our Beijing facility transition efforts created incremental headwinds during the quarter. Beijing relocation expenses in the quarter were approximately $340,000, similar to the prior quarters spend levels. On the non-GAAP basis, which takes into consideration adding back FAS 123R expenses as well as asset retirement obligations, our non-GAAP gross margins came in at 34.4%.

The total GAAP operating expenses for R&D and SG&A were $9.3 million, approximately $1.5 million higher than the prior quarter. SG&A increased by $0.6 million. The increase was driven by a $0.5 million in PPNE impairments, impairment charges related to the Beijing facility transition and $0.5 million in severance charges related to the same. These increases were offset by lower litigation expenses and audit-related activities. R&D increased by $0.9 million, driven by higher Fiber Optic Gyro R&D activities, higher payroll and related taxes and accruals. For further details, please see the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables in the press release. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the second quarter was $1.7 million, reflecting a decrease of $0.5 million over the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $3.7 million or 11.4% of revenue compared to $3.5 million or 11.5% of revenue in the prior quarter.
Making further adjustments for Beijing facility transition expenses, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter would have been closer to $4 million or 12.4% of revenues, very close to the Q4 FY17 operating profit margin objectives of 12.5% that we identified during our prior calls. Our GAAP pretax income from continuing operations was $1.8 million in Q2 or flat relative to the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP pretax income after taking into consideration certain adjustments, all of which are set forth in the non GAAP tables included in today's press release, was $3.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $3.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter -- in the prior quarter. Please note that we've included additional information regarding unique transactions, litigation-related expenditures, impairments, severance, stock compensation, amortization and other items in today's press release to provide further clarity of our results.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. At the end of Q2 FY17, the company's cash and cash equivalents were approximately $68.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million over the prior quarter.
Regarding our working capital metrics, DSOs were at 57 days, showing significant improvement from the prior quarter DSOs of 77 days. This performance was driven by an even loaded revenue profile in the quarter as well as solid collection efforts. Net inventory turns including noncurrent inventory was at 2.6X, holding steady compared to 2.7X in the prior quarter. Absolute value of net inventory declined $2 million quarter-over-quarter. In Q2 FY17, we invested $1.3 million in capital expenditures and recognized approximately $0.9 million in depreciation.
Capital expenditures declined from Q1 as we moved towards the completion of our Beijing facility transition. Overall, the company generated strong free cash flow of $5.2 million in the quarter.
In summary, we continued to make solid operational and financial progress towards our Q4 FY17 operational and financial objectives.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Thanks, Jikun, and good morning, everyone. As Jikun highlighted, we continued our momentum into the second fiscal quarter delivering sequential revenue growth of 8% in what is normally our seasonally softest quarter, and year-over-year growth of 51% coming in above the high end of our guidance.
More importantly, during the quarter, we again demonstrated our improving manufacturing efficiency and operating leverage by growing non-GAAP operating income sequentially by about 7%, coming in at the high end of the 9.5% to 11.5% guidance. Despite the unfavorable mix of our far higher expenses caused by the relocation of our China-based manufacturing operation and heavy R&D investment. With that said, I'd like to provide you with some additional color on the trends we're seeing in each of our served markets as well as the operations of our business.

Within the cable television market, in the second quarter we continued to see strong sequential growth, as our business grew roughly 9% from the first quarter and was up 100% -- 107% over the prior year. As we discussed on our last call, larger than planned RFoG shipments offset the typical seasonal softness we experience in our cable business in the second quarter. Additionally, in Q2, we saw a heavier one-time mix towards the low end of our RFoG product family, marking the end of a model changeover. Going forward, RFoG shipments will primarily consist of more sophisticated, higher-margin products which incorporate OBI mitigation technologies.
While Q2's RFoG heavy mix created an incremental headwind to the gross margins, we kept our operating expenses for those products below the corporate average, allowing them to contribute to operating profit and margin in the quarter. Looking into Q3 and beyond, we continue to see strength in the infrastructure side of cable television, with DOCSIS 3.1 product growth resuming in the June quarter. MSO's remain committed to deploying Fiber networks. In our most recent earnings call, Comcast stated that they expect capital intensity to remain flat year-over-year. However, they also stated that in the first calendar -- their first calendar quarter was about $150 million lighter than planned, and CPE spending would decrease going forward. This implies that the remainder of 2017 infrastructure spend should be stronger than planned.
A few weeks ago, Charter announced a $25 billion infrastructure investment pledge over the next four years. After backing out the estimated standard Charter and TWC annual CapEx spend, the $25 billion figure implies an increase of almost $1 billion a year. We believe we're still in the early innings of the network buildout and are poised to benefit from our new products such as our any LEML-based solutions, which are being integrated across our product lines.
Moving on to the chip market. Revenues grew 51% sequentially quarter-over-quarter and early indications from our customers remain very positive for our 10G parts while we continue product development work on parts to address data center markets. With our OST announcements, we marked the availability of 6.5 gigahertz 5G wireless devices, and expect to continue the development of those products.
We also received additional customer orders in the GPON market, which we can fill from stock, in Q3 and Q4. At a high-level, we expect our penetration into these markets will drive a higher blended margin for both our chip business and for the company overall. Within the Satcom and video market, EMCORE started restructuring its product line over a year ago and is starting to see the benefits from those actions.
We just completed the discontinuation of our video products, which carries excessive engineering costs and cut out over 60% of the product options for our Satcom product line as well. With the introduction of new low-cost L-Band links, technologies for 5G are -- 5G radio over Fiber DAS and are focused upon larger Satcom systems, we expect profits to grow faster than revenue in these product areas. With all that final testing transitioned to our EMS partners in the U.S. complete, we believe we are in a good position to realize incremental operating leverage in these product lines.
Within the Fiber Gyro market -- let's start with the production side of the Gyro business. Within the last week, we received notification that we were awarded Raytheon's Premier Supplier Excellence Award. Only the highest achieving Raytheon suppliers are awarded this distinction. I'm extremely proud of the work that our navigation team has done to earn this award for EMCORE. Our strong performance on the MTS-B program has opened up larger, new programs for EMCORE, which we are actively pursuing through product development. In our previous calls, I indicated that we have important shipment milestones to meet this summer.

As of today, we do expect to meet those delivery commitments, paving the way for production of these new products in FY18. These new products are developed to industry standard and will be sampled to several other customers during the summer and early fall. These are the largest navigation market opportunities that we pursue today, and we're very excited about our position in this business. We previously announced that we are negotiating a multiyear agreement which could eventually encompass our entire navigation product family. It goes without saying that this is a lengthy process, involving complex government contracting regulation. Consequently, these negotiations have been time-consuming, and will affect short-term Gyro shipments over the next quarter or two.
The most probable impact is some amount of delay in shipment volume, making it unlikely that we will hit the goal of our navigation business being 10% of revenue in Q4. Any movement in shipments should not represent a loss of business, only a delay. Typically, that is just the way the defense business works.
Shifting gears to the operations side of the business. All of our captive cable television manufacturing has been shifted to EMCORE Asia, our new automated facility inside the 5th Ring in Beijing. With this project complete, we've significantly transformed the operations of EMCORE from where they were nearly two years ago.
Over the next three months or so, additional automation equipment will be installed to bring our direct headcount down from about 370 at peak last December to about 100. This may cause us to incur some additional transition cost in the quarter, potentially at about half the level they were in Q2. Even as our Chinese facilities are being transformed, our U.S. operations shifted postcode simulation test and sort operations as well as Chip-On-Block assembly to EMS providers as well. When combined with the changes in our Satcom manufacturing strategy, these actions will result in our breakeven point declining by about $1 million to $1.5 million per quarter.
We should see some impact from these changes in our numbers this quarter, but will fully realize the benefits in Q4. It's important to understand that this manufacturing transformation is not really the end point for EMCORE. Our cable television transmitter manufacturing strategy is a terrific example of this. Over the past year, two of our Six Sigma Green Belt projects have given us the ability to automatically tune CATV transmitters with high accuracy and minimal touch time.
The deep learning project was particularly insightful in raising our understanding of profit dynamics. When combined with new automation techniques, we've achieved 90-plus-percent reduction in touch time per unit. This is now complete. We are going to move transmitter tuning to the EMS providers to eliminate transportation, inventory, carrying cost and to further improve cycle time.
Over the next year, we expect to devote a majority of our Six Sigma Green and Black belt projects to wafer fab operations, where we will not only improve our standard process controls but build the process nodes that will launch new generations of chip products for both captive and emerging markets. We see the fab as a key area for investments in both in terms of capital and the world-class technologist we need as we work to improve our ability to both execute and invent. In our August call, we'll update you all on the result of our 2016 Six Sigma project, just as we did last year with our 2015 actual result.
Turning now to the outlook for the business. In the third fiscal quarter, given the continued strength we're seeing in the cable TV business, we expect to see revenue in the $29 million to $31 million range, with non-GAAP operating margins about 11% to 13% This guidance eliminates over $3 million in low-end RFoG units that was a one-time event in Q2. Margins should also start to improve in Q3, depending on the final mix in the quarter.

Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital. Your line is open.
Timothy Savageaux
Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. Good morning, Tim.
Timothy Savageaux
Okay, great. Sorry, the weather seems muted or not [ph]. Couple of questions. First, congratulations on a real strong -- on March quarter. I did not quite catch what the drivers of upside on the chip side were? Wonder if you might mind running back through that? And also, I think the commentary was, business was as strong as it's been in a while. I don't know if you care to give any more detailed metrics about how much the merchant chip business represented for your business in fiscal Q2?
Jeffrey Rittichier
On the product mix side, was 10G APDs that we shipped out in larger numbers. Jikun, you want to cover the second part of the question?
Jikun Kim
Sure. So in general, I think, we talked about the chip business being increasing 51% quarter-over-quarter. So that's -- in terms of revenue mix for the Corporation, cable TV was about 80% to 85% of the business, Chips were 5% to 10% of the business, Satcom was 5% to 10% percent, and FOG was about 2.5%.
Timothy Savageaux
That is very helpful. And from a margin perspective, kind of came in right in line with where we thought despite a heavier RFoG mix. I gather, perhaps, you saw some offset from the chips strength in terms of overall margin levels, and as you look forward, I certainly understand the kind of one-time nature of the RFoG and not just Comcast based on your comments from ARRIS last night. I think it's fair to expect the current kind of DOCSIS cable TV infrastructure market to continue to grow for the year. But as you look into next quarter you expect continued growth in the chip side as well. And what sort of -- seems like you have a lot of the margin levers moving in the right direction as you head into Q3?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. I would that's right, Tim. We're just trying to be conservative until all the moving parts are settled on the final set of automation. Installations over at EA, but yes, we're -- I think, we're looking at a stronger quarter in terms of chips. Can't break it down any further than that for you. Cable TV, I think, ARRIS said they came in with a book-to-bill of something about 1.13 or something like that. So you know, overall, the signals look quite good. And we'll be at Angus in a couple of weeks, over in Europe, when we'll have a chance to see what Liberty Global's up to, more specifically. But right now, cable TV is still looking quite strong.
Timothy Savageaux
Good. And maybe 1 final question on the chip side. I don't know if you've made any comments on kind of the Datacom data center type opportunity. We've had other players in the market there, may come in particular. Kind of very nearly kind of shift the entire strategy of the corporation toward opportunities for 25 gig lasers in the data center talking about sort of multimillion unit type volume opportunities. We know you've been doing some developing work in that direction. I don't know if that's translating into any revenue yet, but I'd love to hear an update on what's happening on the data com side of the merchant chip business?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Don't have much more to say. I would say, if anything, our detector projects are ahead of the laser projects. We're still moving forward with a number of customers and we'll comment further when we actually have something to announce.
Timothy Savageaux
Okay. Well, congrats once again on a good quarter. And I'll pass it on.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Thank you, Tim.
Operator
And our next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.

Jaeson Schmidt
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on one of the previous questions. Jeff, wondering if you could talk about how your visibility might have improved over the last 30 months? Or kind of where your overall visibility is at this point?
Jeffrey Rittichier
With respect to cable television or other products?
Jaeson Schmidt
Yes, CATV.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Okay. Well, it's -- in cable television, typically by the time we announced the previous quarter's results and we are providing guidance going forward. We really have the bulk of the cable television orders in place, and there is really very minimal amounts of movement that are allowed based on the supply agreements we have in place. Almost nothing in 30 days, and then sort of depends from there out. And we try to accommodate customers wherever we can. But inside the 60 days, things are pretty firm. Beyond that, we look into the forecasting systems of our customers and we've got techniques for eliminating double counting and things like that. So it's really the combination of that information and indications about infrastructure spend in the MSOs that give us the insights beyond 90 days out, okay?
So not much has really changed as far as the way that we look at the information, I think with the most recent announcements from Comcast, Charter, you look at what ARRIS is now saying publicly, things look pretty good, in the second half of the year. But cable TV compared to say -- again, we commented about having a multiyear supply agreement. We're negotiating -- those 2 visibility situations are very different, right?
Jaeson Schmidt
No, that makes sense, and is very helpful. Just a clarification on the Beijing facility transition. Those costs will be concluded by the end of the June quarter. Is that correct?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. So essentially what we did is we moved everything from one facility into the other. The majority of it has have the automation installed. There are a couple of places where automation is being put in place, literally as we speak. Should be largely complete, end of May, beginning of June. So we'll see a little bit of transition costs. We expect it to be down quite a bit from where we've seen it.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. And given the strong margin performance you just posted, I assume that 12.5% pro forma operating margin exiting this year and 15% exiting '18. If those targets are still on track?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. We feel real good about that period.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. Perfect. And then just the last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue. Any change as far as how you're thinking about CapEx this year?
Jikun Kim
Yes -- go ahead, Jeff.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Go ahead, Jikun.
Jikun Kim
Yes, so I think we discussed $6 million to $7 million in CapEx at the beginning of the year. Q1 was high. Q2, you can see, it came down quite a bit from Q1. I think we're still on track and, obviously, many of our capital investment decisions are predicated on return on investment. So if we have opportunities where the payback is 12 to 18 months, we'll go ahead and invest.
Jeffrey Rittichier
The other thing to understand about CapEx is some of these, especially when you start talking about fab equipment, you're looking at lead times per equipment that could be nine months or more, right? So the date that we make commitments versus the dates they come in and get commissioned often times there is a called a phase lag.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Jo Maxa from Daughtry & Company. Your line is open.
Joseph Maxa
Thank you. I just wanted to touch base on the gyroscope business. You did mentioned a delay in some shipments in the second half of the year. I wanted to just to walk through that again. It sounded like it had a lot to do with the government contracts. Just maybe give us a little more color on what you're seeing and when you would expect those to start shipping?

Jeffrey Rittichier
Sure. I'd like to -- I'm going to defer to Jikun, because he's been involved with the contract negotiations, and I will say it's great to have a former Raytheon CFO as your CFO in these sorts of situations. So Jikun, if you wouldn't mind providing in some color on this.
Jikun Kim
Sure. So it's a multiyear agreement. It's a five-year agreement that we're negotiating, and given the size of the opportunity and the contract, there's extra government compliance regulations required, and as an organization, this is probably our first foray into a multiyear government contract. And so we're being very methodical and careful about how we understand the requirements and our ability to perform to the requirements. It's not necessarily the product qualifications or product quality requirements but it's all the terms and conditions that come along with taking a very large government contract, and that's just taking a little time.
Joseph Maxa
In that type of contract, how do you see that unfold? Is it more of a grow through the five years? I mean, may be the first year is the start, but is it more kind of a win here as, once you get up to a certain run rate?
Jikun Kim
No. The projections look like it's increasing over time, but the concern would be, the future is more certain in the next six months than five years out, right? so you've got to kind of discount some of the further out volumes that people project, and there's some business backing and involved in making that kind of a judgment call.
Joseph Maxa
Okay, that's helpful. On the chips business, your commentary about initial orders coming from the second half of the GPON market. Are you -- did you indicate that you expect the chip business to grow from Q2 levels in the back half?
Jikun Kim
Sure.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. I think we will.
Jikun Kim
Sorry Jeff, go ahead.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes. I think, it will. Again, the point that we -- had been made -- we had made in the past about GPON was that we really are only going to supply customers that are, let's call it, multigenerational with 2.5G product, and not for -- we're jumping back into it. It's just that we have some inventory, and so we'll continue to supply that. Maybe we'll make a little bit more for them. But it's really the 10G targets that are going to get 2.5G attention from us when and if they need it. Just to make it easier for them to do business with us.
Joseph Maxa
So in the quarter, was it the 10G product that drove the business or was it more of the 2.5G?
Jeffrey Rittichier
It was a combination of telecom parts, the 10G parts. 2.5G, we've got orders, Joe, that will build in Q3 and Q4.
Joseph Maxa
Okay, I see. And then, I wanted to ask on the SG&A line. Last year you had a big step up. And I'm wondering if you would expect to see something like that this June quarter? I think last year you said something about a large trade show.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Jikun?
Jikun Kim
Yes, the seasonally high trade show quarter was this past quarter. OFC is the big trade show. So we're past that. ANGA is a relatively smaller trade show. So we would anticipate, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A line to be steady.
Joseph Maxa
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lee Krowl with B. Riley and Company. Your line is open.
Lee Krowl
Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I think most of them have actually been covered but one question on the defense opportunity. In there -- is that contract does win, just given kind of the duration and magnitude of it, is that an incremental step up in CapEx when that, if and when that is announced?
Jikun Kim
Jeff, do you want to take that one or...
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes, sure. I wasn't sure if you meant backward or not. The CapEx necessary for that particular project is pretty much in place. We are going to be putting in addition CapEx for other Gyro products that can certainly be used in this contract, but we've been building these particular gyros for that customer for the better part of two years at about these sorts of rate. So it's not a big jolt to the system over on manufacturing CapEx.

Lee Krowl
Okay. And then just kind of as that flows through, is that -- is the margin structure of the larger contract like that comparable? Or do you have to concede to the fact that it's just a larger contract win? So there is some concessions there?
Jikun Kim
Yes...
Jeffrey Rittichier
Well, you know -- go ahead, Jikun.
Jikun Kim
All right. In general, when customers provide assured, longer and higher volumes, there's expectations there are concession on prices, right? So -- but I think we should be able to hold around here.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Yes, and the short version is, the margin would be above corporate average.
Lee Krowl
Okay. I was just -- the reason I was thinking it was, trying to think if guys got this big project online, if that changes the timing of the -- kind of the outlook on the overall operating margin targets. But I guess...
Jeffrey Rittichier
No. It really -- it won't. It won't, except in a positive way. It just might push some revenue around more than we would like. But the long-term feature on these products is excellent, and so we're really excited about where we are here.
Lee Krowl
Okay. And then on the GPON market, is that a function of kind of renewed CapEx? Or is there kind of incremental activity in the GPON market just because inventories have kind of been worked down and now are at more at a normalized level?
Jeffrey Rittichier
It's really more the latter than the former. And again, we're only going to supply major customers that are going to buy next-generation product from us. We're not going to be running around in China selling small amounts of this and that.
Lee Krowl
Got it, got it. Fair enough. And then, just on the last part. On these large CapEx projects from Charter -- I guess, the question is that, if these guys come in to you with a large order and kind of comes back to the margin standpoint, are these larger billion dollar run rate kind of CapEx budgets, do they require pricing concessions at all just because of the consolidation of customers?
Jeffrey Rittichier
Well, it's a very competitive market. And you've always got pricing pressure. I wouldn't say that the uptick is triggering unusual activity.
Lee Krowl
Got it. Fair enough. Alright…
Jeffrey Rittichier
I mean, it's a competitive world as it is over in telecom.
Lee Krowl
Right. Well, you've definitely covered my questions. Congrats on a great quarter and I'll get back in line.
Operator
And I'm showing no further courses. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff, the CEO, for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey Rittichier
Thank you. In closing, I just want to thank the team here at EMCORE for the hard work they put in every day. I believe I speak for everyone when I say how proud we are of the business we've built, the opportunity that lies ahead. And thank you all for your time today, especially those guys from the west Coast who have woken up early. Thanks, again, and we look forward to talking to you soon.
Operator
Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
