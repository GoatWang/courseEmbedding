Regulation G Statement


This web page includes financial results and guidance for NiSource Inc. with respect to net operating earnings and operating earnings, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC’s Regulation G. NiSource Inc. includes such measures because management believes they permit investors to view NiSource Inc.'s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate NiSource Inc.'s ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be differences between such measures and GAAP equivalents due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results. NiSource Inc. is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis. 


Forward-Looking Statements 


This web page contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Examples of forward-looking statements on this web page include statements and expectations regarding NiSource’s business, performance, growth, investment opportunities, and planned, identified, infrastructure or utility investments. All forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, forecasts, estimates, plans, expectations and strategic direction discussed on this web page include, among other things, NiSource’s debt obligations; any changes in NiSource’s credit rating; NiSource’s ability to execute its growth strategy; changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions; pension funding obligations; economic regulation and the impact of regulatory rate reviews; NiSource's ability to obtain expected financial or regulatory outcomes; any damage to NiSource's reputation; compliance with environmental laws and the costs of associated liabilities; fluctuations in demand from residential and commercial customers; economic conditions of certain industries; the success of NIPSCO's electric generation strategy; the price of energy commodities and related transportation costs; the reliability of customers and suppliers to fulfill their payment and contractual obligations; potential impairments of goodwill or definite-lived intangible assets; changes in taxation and accounting principles; potential incidents and other operating risks associated with our business; the impact of an aging infrastructure; the impact of climate change; potential cyber-attacks; construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks; extreme weather conditions; the attraction and retention of a qualified workforce; advances in technology; the ability of NiSource's subsidiaries to generate cash; uncertainties related to the expected benefits of NiSource's separation from Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. and other matters set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” section of NiSource’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NiSource expressly disclaims any duty to update, supplement or amend any of its forward-looking statements contained in this on this web page, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

NiSource Finance Corp. Enters into Fourth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd
Nov 28 16
On November 28, 2016, NiSource Finance Corp., as borrower, and NiSource Inc., as guarantor, entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., as Co-Syndication Agents, Citibank, N.A., Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents, and Barclays Bank PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The Agreement amends NiSource Finance’s existing $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement to increase the facility by $350 million to $1.85 billion and to extend the term from July 1, 2020 until November 28, 2021. Up to $150 million of the facility will be available in the form of standby letters of credit. NiSource Finance has the right to increase the facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions and the consent of the increasing lenders. The Agreement provides that revolving loans will bear interest at the option of the company at: a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate (which is a floating rate equal to the higher of the prime rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent from time to time, the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time + 0.50% and one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate + 1.0%) plus an applicable margin (which applicable margin would be 7.5 basis points, based on the Company’s current ratings), or a rate equal to the 1 week or 1, 2, 3 or 6-month Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin (which applicable margin would be 107.5 basis points, based on the Company’s current ratings). Other than increasing the size of the facility and extending the term, the Agreement substantially restates the existing Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, including representations and warranties, financial and other covenants and events of default. A copy of the Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing discussion of the Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.

In addition to the consideration amounts described above, holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date, which is expected to be May 26, 2017, in the case of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline, or June 9, 2017, in the case of Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline.
The Tender Offers are not conditioned upon any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and the Tender Offers may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn in whole or with respect to one or more series of the Notes. NiSource Finance will only accept for purchase Maximum Tender Notes up to the applicable Tender Caps.
NiSource Finance reserves the right to increase, decrease or eliminate the Tender Cap with respect to any series of Maximum Tender Notes. If Holders tender more Maximum Tender Notes in the Maximum Tender Offers than they expect to be accepted for purchase by NiSource Finance based on the applicable Tender Caps for the Maximum Tender Notes being tendered, and NiSource Finance subsequently accepts more than such Holders expected of such Maximum Tender Notes tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Withdrawal Deadline, such Holders will not be able to withdraw any of their previously tendered Maximum Tender Notes. Accordingly, Holders should not tender any Maximum Tender Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase.
Subject to the applicable Tender Caps, all Maximum Tender Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted before any Maximum Tender Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline are accepted in the Maximum Tender Offers.
The offers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, among other things, NiSource Finance receiving proceeds from the debt offering announced today sufficient to purchase all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase by the Company and to pay all fees and expenses in connection with the Tender Offers.
*          *          *
The complete terms and conditions of the offers are set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Holders of Any and All Notes and Maximum Tender Notes are urged to read these documents carefully before making any decision with respect to the tender offers.
None of NiSource or its affiliates, their respective boards of directors, the Dealer Managers, the tender and information agent or the Trustee with respect to the Notes is making any recommendation as to whether holders should tender any Notes in response to any of the Tender Offers, and neither NiSource nor any such other person has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to whether to tender any of their notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.

 (1) The applicable page on Bloomberg from which Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will quote the bid side prices of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security.

The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on June 2, 2015, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Expiration Time"). Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on May 18, 2015, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Early Tender Deadline") to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below) for their tendered Notes. After such time, the Notes may not be withdrawn except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. 
The "Total Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes of any series tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread specified for such series over the yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security specified for such series in the table above and on the front cover of the Offer to Purchase. Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration for such Notes, which includes an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase (the "Early Tender Premium"). Holders of Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and on or before the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Tender Consideration for such Notes, which equals the applicable Total Consideration for such Notes minus the Early Tender Premium. Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date for such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable settlement date. 
The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and the Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn in whole or with respect to one or more series of Notes. The amounts of each series of Notes that are purchased on any settlement date will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels set forth on the table above and the front cover of the Offer to Purchase (the "Acceptance Priority Levels"), with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 4 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level. In addition, no more than $275,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the series of Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 1 and no more than $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the series of Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 2 will be purchased in the Tender Offer (each such aggregate principal amount, a "Tender Cap" with respect to the applicable series of Notes). NiSource will only accept for purchase Notes up to a combined aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount"), subject to the applicable Tender Caps and Acceptance Priority Levels. 
NiSource reserves the right to increase or decrease the Maximum Amount, increase, decrease or eliminate any Tender Cap, or change the Acceptance Priority Level with respect to any series of Notes. If Holders tender more Notes in the Tender Offer than they expect to be accepted for purchase by NiSource based on a lower Acceptance Priority Level and/or any applicable Tender Cap for the Notes being tendered, and NiSource subsequently accepts more than such Holders expected of such Notes tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Withdrawal Deadline, such Holders will not be able to withdraw any of their previously tendered Notes. Accordingly, Holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase.
Subject to the applicable Tender Caps, all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer, and all Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer. However, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline, even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Deadline.
Notes of a series subject to a Tender Cap may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn is greater than the applicable Tender Cap. Furthermore, if purchasing all of the tendered Notes of a series of Notes of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any settlement date would cause the Maximum Amount or applicable Tender Cap to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that settlement date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that settlement date such that the Maximum Amount or applicable Tender Cap will not be exceeded. Furthermore, if the Tender Offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their Notes accepted for payment. If a series of Notes is fully subscribed up to the applicable Tender Cap as of the Early Tender Deadline, Holders who validly tender Notes of such series after the Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their Notes accepted for payment (absent any subsequent increase in the applicable Tender Cap).
Subject to applicable law, the Tender Offer may be amended, extended, terminated or withdrawn with respect to one or more series of Notes. If the Tender Offer is terminated with respect to any series of Notes without Notes of such series being accepted for purchase, Notes of such series tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer will promptly be returned to the tendering holders. Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer and not purchased due to the priority acceptance procedures or due to proration will be returned to the tendering holders promptly following the Expiration Time or, if the Tender Offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, promptly following the Early Tender Deadline.
The Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, among other things, the payment of a special dividend to NiSource by Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc., a business unit of NiSource that is expected to separate from NiSource and become a stand-alone publicly traded company, in accordance with the terms of the financing condition more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.
This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful. The Tender Offer is being made solely pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 134 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are serving as Dealer Managers for the Tender Offer. Questions regarding the Tender Offer may be directed to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at (800) 828-3182 (toll free) or (212) 902-6941 (collect) or to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC at (800) 624-1808 (toll free) or (212) 761-1057 (collect).

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

NiSource Announces Expiration And Final Results For Its Cash Tender Offers









PR Newswire




Jun 9, 2017 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  MERRILLVILLE, Ind., June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) announced today the expiration and final results of the previously announced cash tender offers made by its finance subsidiary, NiSource Finance Corp. for any and all of NiSource Finance's outstanding 6.125% Notes due 2022 (the "Any and All Notes") and up to a specified maximum aggregate principal amount of each of its 6.40% Notes due 2018, 6.80% Notes due 2019 and 5.45% Notes due 2020 (collectively, the "Maximum Tender Offer Notes" and, together with the Any and All Notes, the "Notes"). The consideration to be paid in the tender offer for each series of Notes was previously announced on May 25, 2017.     The tender offers expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 8, 2017 (the "Expiration Time"). On May 26, 2017 (the "Early Settlement Date"), NiSource purchased $319,308,000 aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes, $200,922,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.40% Notes due 2018, $244,883,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.80% Notes due 2019 and $224,887,000 aggregate principal amount of the 5.45% Notes due 2020, which were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the tender offers as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on May 24, 2017 (the "Early Tender Deadline"). As NiSource Finance purchased the maximum amount of each series of Maximum Tender Offer Notes on the Early Settlement Date, Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline were not accepted for purchase. As of the Expiration Time, $320,046,000 aggregate principal amount of the Any and All Notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the tender offers, of which $738,000 were tendered after the Early Tender Deadline, according to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the tender agent for the tender offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the tender offer for the Any and All Notes, NiSource Finance will accept for purchase all of the Any and All Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time pursuant to the tender offer. The settlement for the Any and All Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase by NiSource Finance is expected to take place on June 9, 2017. Holders whose Any and All Notes were accepted for purchase will receive $1,139.25 per $1,000 principal amount, which excludes the $30 early tender premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the payment date. NiSource Finance's obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, any of the Any and All Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase pursuant to the tender offer is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase under the heading "Terms of the Tender Offers - Conditions to the Tender Offers." As previously announced, NiSource Finance has completed the sale of $2,000,000,000 of long-term debt securities, and the "Financing Condition" described in the Offer to Purchase has been satisfied. This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful. The tender offers were made solely pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 134 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Company operations[edit]
NiSource's natural gas utilities provide domestically produced supplies of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers via nearly 60,000 miles of pipeline and related facilities in seven states: Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
NiSource provides electric energy to nearly 500,000 customers, all located in northern Indiana. NiSource’s electric operations include power generation, transmission and local distribution, as well as wholesale and electric transmission transactions. NiSource uses both traditional and renewable generation sources, including natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and coal generated supplies, providing a total system operating net capability of more than 3,000 megawatts.
In 2015, NiSource was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability - North America Index for the second year in a row and for the ninth time since 1999.[1]
Internal organization[edit]
NiSource operates seven local utilities in its service region.

Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO)
Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (Previously Bay State Gas)
Columbia Gas of Ohio
Columbia Gas of Kentucky
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania
Columbia Gas of Maryland
Columbia Gas of Virginia

Recent corporate actions[edit]
On July 1, 2015, NiSource separated Columbia Pipeline Group (NYSE: CPGX) into a stand-alone publicly traded company. Each NiSource shareholder at the time of the separation received one share of Columbia Pipeline Group for each share of NiSource. The separation of Columbia Pipeline Group included Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Gulf Transmission, Columbia Midstream Group, its ownership in Columbia Pipeline Partners (NYSE: CPPL), and other natural gas pipeline, storage and midstream holdings.[2]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized NiSource for spending $1.83 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $227 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $1.4 billion, and increasing executive pay by 33% to $11.2 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[3] One rule NiSource, among other companies, benefitted from was a bonus depreciation rule that lowered the federal tax expense. NiSource stated, “This law, enacted by Congress, encouraged companies like NiSource to accelerate capital investments to spur economic recovery by permitting portions of these investments to be deducted at an accelerated rate. Only the timing of the deductions was changed, and not the amount that could be deducted. This means our income tax expense will likely be higher in the future.” [4]

NiSource, Inc. is one of the largest fully regulated utility companies in the United States, serving approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and 500,000 electric customers across seven states through its local Columbia Gas and NIPSCO brands. The company, based in Merrillville, Indiana, United States, has more than 7,000 employees.

Company operations[edit]
NiSource's natural gas utilities provide domestically produced supplies of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers via nearly 60,000 miles of pipeline and related facilities in seven states: Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
NiSource provides electric energy to nearly 500,000 customers, all located in northern Indiana. NiSource’s electric operations include power generation, transmission and local distribution, as well as wholesale and electric transmission transactions. NiSource uses both traditional and renewable generation sources, including natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and coal generated supplies, providing a total system operating net capability of more than 3,000 megawatts.
In 2015, NiSource was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability - North America Index for the second year in a row and for the ninth time since 1999.[1]
Internal organization[edit]
NiSource operates seven local utilities in its service region.

Columbia Gas of Virginia

Recent corporate actions[edit]
On July 1, 2015, NiSource separated Columbia Pipeline Group (NYSE: CPGX) into a stand-alone publicly traded company. Each NiSource shareholder at the time of the separation received one share of Columbia Pipeline Group for each share of NiSource. The separation of Columbia Pipeline Group included Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Gulf Transmission, Columbia Midstream Group, its ownership in Columbia Pipeline Partners (NYSE: CPPL), and other natural gas pipeline, storage and midstream holdings.[2]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized NiSource for spending $1.83 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $227 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $1.4 billion, and increasing executive pay by 33% to $11.2 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[3] One rule NiSource, among other companies, benefitted from was a bonus depreciation rule that lowered the federal tax expense. NiSource stated, “This law, enacted by Congress, encouraged companies like NiSource to accelerate capital investments to spur economic recovery by permitting portions of these investments to be deducted at an accelerated rate. Only the timing of the deductions was changed, and not the amount that could be deducted. This means our income tax expense will likely be higher in the future.” [4]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
