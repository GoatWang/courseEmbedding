Career[edit]
Smith made her screen debut with small role in the 1994 film Twin Sitters.[3] From 1996 to 1997, she starred in the NBC sitcom, Boston Common. Later in 1997, she was cast alongside Tom Arnold in another short-lived sitcom, The Tom Show on The WB.[3] In 2000, she was supporting role in the critically acclaimed HBO miniseries, The Corner in which she played a drug addict.[3] In the 2000s, Smith had guest starring roles on The Parkers, Without a Trace, Nip/Tuck and Girlfriends. She has made number of supporting performances in films such as Playas Ball (2003), The Whole Ten Yards (2004) and ATL (2006).
Smith has played roles in multiple Tyler Perry projects. In 2007, she appeared as the main antagonist in the romantic comedy-drama film, Daddy's Little Girls. She played the role of Angela Williams in the Why Did I Get Married? (2007) and its sequel Why Did I Get Married Too? (2010). This role she later played in the comedy series based on films, Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse.
Smith co-starred opposite Ice Cube and Keke Palmer in the family comedy-drama film, The Longshots (2008). She had supporting role in the romantic comedy film Couples Retreat (2009), and co-starred alongside Salli Richardson in Pastor Brown (2010). In 2011, she appeared in the comedy-drama film Jumping the Broom, and in 2014 played psychotherapist in the erotic thriller, Addicted.[4] In 2014, she also was cast as recurring in the Fox drama series Empire as Carol Hardaway, Cookie Lyon's younger sister.[5] In 2015, Smith made her directorial debut with Boxed In, that premiered during the 19th Annual American Black Film Festival.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Smith was born in Camden, New Jersey, and was raised by a single mother.[2] She has an identical twin sister named Sidra Smith, who currently lives in Harlem.[2]
Smith is a Christian.[7][8] In an interview with EURweb.com, Smith discussed her conversion from atheism to Christianity: "When I was 25 I had an encounter with God because my father had gotten sick. I had a time where I really challenged God, like, if you're really God you'll show me such-and-such'. I was going through this whole thing where I questioned whether God was real or not. I really needed God to be real because I was feeling so depressed and so unhappy, I felt like if there isn't a God [then] I have no reason to live. It was just a bad time in my life and God really showed up and met me where I was."
In December 2010, Smith married her boyfriend of one year Keith Douglas, who was also her manager.[9] In November 2014, Smith appeared in court to request a restraining order against Douglas, who in documents filed prior to the court appearance, she said accused her of having affairs with other women. Smith's friend Tisha Campbell-Martin acted as a character witness.[10] The final divorce decree was issued in March 2015.[11] However, Smith contested the divorce by alleging that Douglas concealed information from her that she should have known before the marriage. Smith alleged that Douglas was not "man of the cloth" that he presented himself to be during their courtship.[1] She also said that, if she had known about Douglas' background, she would not have married him. The allegations about Douglas' background included five marriages before he married Smith, multiple children that he did not claim and disclose to Smith, and non-payment of income taxes for nearly a decade. The judge in the case granted Smith an annulment of the marriage in December 2015 on the basis of fraud committed by Douglas.[1]
Smith is involved in some off-screen ventures, such as an organic perfume line titled "US", which she launched in 2011 with Keith Douglas, who, at the time, was her then-husband and manager.[12]

Smith alleged that Douglas was not "man of the cloth" that he presented himself to be during their courtship.[1] She also said that, if she had known about Douglas' background, she would not have married him. The allegations about Douglas' background included five marriages before he married Smith, multiple children that he did not claim and disclose to Smith, and non-payment of income taxes for nearly a decade. The judge in the case granted Smith an annulment of the marriage in December 2015 on the basis of fraud committed by Douglas.[1]
Smith is involved in some off-screen ventures, such as an organic perfume line titled "US", which she launched in 2011 with Keith Douglas, who, at the time, was her then-husband and manager.[12]

Career[edit]
Smith made her screen debut with small role in the 1994 film Twin Sitters.[3] From 1996 to 1997, she starred in the NBC sitcom, Boston Common. Later in 1997, she was cast alongside Tom Arnold in another short-lived sitcom, The Tom Show on The WB.[3] In 2000, she was supporting role in the critically acclaimed HBO miniseries, The Corner in which she played a drug addict.[3] In the 2000s, Smith had guest starring roles on The Parkers, Without a Trace, Nip/Tuck and Girlfriends. She has made number of supporting performances in films such as Playas Ball (2003), The Whole Ten Yards (2004) and ATL (2006).
Smith has played roles in multiple Tyler Perry projects. In 2007, she appeared as the main antagonist in the romantic comedy-drama film, Daddy's Little Girls. She played the role of Angela Williams in the Why Did I Get Married? (2007) and its sequel Why Did I Get Married Too? (2010). This role she later played in the comedy series based on films, Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse.
Smith co-starred opposite Ice Cube and Keke Palmer in the family comedy-drama film, The Longshots (2008). She had supporting role in the romantic comedy film Couples Retreat (2009), and co-starred alongside Salli Richardson in Pastor Brown (2010). In 2011, she appeared in the comedy-drama film Jumping the Broom, and in 2014 played psychotherapist in the erotic thriller, Addicted.[4] In 2014, she also was cast as recurring in the Fox drama series Empire as Carol Hardaway, Cookie Lyon's younger sister.[5] In 2015, Smith made her directorial debut with Boxed In, that premiered during the 19th Annual American Black Film Festival.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Smith was born in Camden, New Jersey, and was raised by a single mother.[2] She has an identical twin sister named Sidra Smith, who currently lives in Harlem.[2]
Smith is a Christian.[7][8] In an interview with EURweb.com, Smith discussed her conversion from atheism to Christianity: "When I was 25 I had an encounter with God because my father had gotten sick. I had a time where I really challenged God, like, if you're really God you'll show me such-and-such'. I was going through this whole thing where I questioned whether God was real or not. I really needed God to be real because I was feeling so depressed and so unhappy, I felt like if there isn't a God [then] I have no reason to live. It was just a bad time in my life and God really showed up and met me where I was."
In December 2010, Smith married her boyfriend of one year Keith Douglas, who was also her manager.[9] In November 2014, Smith appeared in court to request a restraining order against Douglas, who in documents filed prior to the court appearance, she said accused her of having affairs with other women. Smith's friend Tisha Campbell-Martin acted as a character witness.[10] The final divorce decree was issued in March 2015.[11] However, Smith contested the divorce by alleging that Douglas concealed information from her that she should have known before the marriage. Smith alleged that Douglas was not "man of the cloth" that he presented himself to be during their courtship.[1] She also said that, if she had known about Douglas' background, she would not have married him. The allegations about Douglas' background included five marriages before he married Smith, multiple children that he did not claim and disclose to Smith, and non-payment of income taxes for nearly a decade. The judge in the case granted Smith an annulment of the marriage in December 2015 on the basis of fraud committed by Douglas.[1]
Smith is involved in some off-screen ventures, such as an organic perfume line titled "US", which she launched in 2011 with Keith Douglas, who, at the time, was her then-husband and manager.[12]

CelebrityTasha Smith Gets Married – in Her Living Room    By Alison Schwartz•@alisonbrookePosted on December 24, 2010 at 3:30pm EDT

Michael Williams/Startraks



There’s no place like home – for your wedding.  
When actress Tasha Smith exchanged vows with husband Keith Douglas earlier this month, the couple kept the ceremony low-key, holding the affair in the living room of their Los Angeles house.  
“We discussed having a small wedding with close family and friends, but instead, we decided to hold a very simple, intimate ceremony with just us and our pastor,” Smith, 39, tells Essence. “We prayed about it, and it just felt right for us.” 
Smith and Douglas, an entrepreneur, announced their engagement six months ago.  
For Smith – who next appears on the big screen alongside Angela Bassett and Paula Patton in romantic comedy  – the wedding is a fairytale ending to a less-than-perfect past.  
“I’ve been to the worst place I could ever be,” she told PEOPLE in 2007 of her childhood in Camden, N.J., where she grew up in a city wrought with gangsters, drugs and poverty – and one of the highest murder rates in the nation. “But I always had a dream.”  
Smith was previously married to a youth counselor, who she divorced in 2007. Now back from her Sin City honeymoon at the Lake Las Vegas resort, she says her wedding was the best way to cap off the year.  
“It was a beautiful, blessed moment that we will remember forever,” she says.

She claimed Douglas flies into jealous rages and calls her a "f***ing d**e" while accusing her of sleeping with other women."When he's in a rage, I feel that he is capable of killing me," Smith claimed.The Tyler Perry star, who is a former atheist, shared her struggles with faith in an interview earlier this year."There was definitely a time where I did not believe in the Lord. I needed to understand the love of God. You hear so many people always telling you what you should or shouldn't do, telling you you're a sinner, telling you how bad you are, all those things about yourself. I was lacking the understanding of the love of God. I didn't know there was a God that loved me," she said."I think that it's the love of God that brings man into repentance. Once you embrace that love and have that fellowship with God, all those things that you shouldn't be doing will go away. He said no flesh is going to glory in His presence. Once we spend time in the presence of God and fellowship with him, all that stuff that we thought was so great, that we idolized, that we made so big in our lives become so small and insignificant in the presence of God," she noted."To be honest, I am so grateful about where I am in my life right now. Based on where I've come from, every day is a blessing. I'm human and there are definitely times when I get down, but I try not to focus on that," she added.YouTube Contact: leonardo.blair@christianpost.com; follow me on Twitter @leoblair   Share on facebook Share on twitter   Share  Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit  Free sign up cp newsletter!Sign up        Most Popular   Smartphone Technology Causing Mental Health Crisis; Parents Urged to Place Limits      Christian Rocker Brian Welch of Korn Says Linkin Park's Chester Bennington Chose 'Cowardly Way Out'      Pastor Forced to Move After Receiving Threats for Opposing Facebook's Rainbow Flag Emoji      Joanna Gaines Asks for Help From Fans After False Rumor Spreads About 'Fixer Upper' Stars      'I Never Felt Qualified' to Preach, Perry Noble Tells NewSpring Leaders Who Declared Him Biblically Unfit      Sponsored Article     'I'm Not Ashamed' Movie Star on Playing Rachel Scott, Her New Devotional, and Texting Sadie Robertson (Interview)      Former Atheist Lee Strobel on 'The Case for Christ' Film and Why He's Encouraged Amid Post-Modern Society (Interview)       Former Atheist Lee Strobel: Here's How to Encourage Non-Christians to See 'The Case for Christ' Film      'Good Luck Charlie' Actress Leigh-Allyn Baker on Heartwarming New PureFlix Film 'Wish for Christmas' (Interview)      Pure Flix Founder David A.R.

She claimed Douglas flies into jealous rages and calls her a "f***ing d**e" while accusing her of sleeping with other women."When he's in a rage, I feel that he is capable of killing me," Smith claimed.The Tyler Perry star, who is a former atheist, shared her struggles with faith in an interview earlier this year."There was definitely a time where I did not believe in the Lord. I needed to understand the love of God. You hear so many people always telling you what you should or shouldn't do, telling you you're a sinner, telling you how bad you are, all those things about yourself. I was lacking the understanding of the love of God. I didn't know there was a God that loved me," she said."I think that it's the love of God that brings man into repentance. Once you embrace that love and have that fellowship with God, all those things that you shouldn't be doing will go away. He said no flesh is going to glory in His presence. Once we spend time in the presence of God and fellowship with him, all that stuff that we thought was so great, that we idolized, that we made so big in our lives become so small and insignificant in the presence of God," she noted."To be honest, I am so grateful about where I am in my life right now. Based on where I've come from, every day is a blessing. I'm human and there are definitely times when I get down, but I try not to focus on that," she added.YouTube Contact: leonardo.blair@christianpost.com; follow me on Twitter @leoblair   Share on facebook Share on twitter   Share  Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit  Free sign up cp newsletter!Sign up        Most Popular   Smartphone Technology Causing Mental Health Crisis; Parents Urged to Place Limits      Christian Rocker Brian Welch of Korn Says Linkin Park's Chester Bennington Chose 'Cowardly Way Out'      Pastor Forced to Move After Receiving Threats for Opposing Facebook's Rainbow Flag Emoji      Joanna Gaines Asks for Help From Fans After False Rumor Spreads About 'Fixer Upper' Stars      'I Never Felt Qualified' to Preach, Perry Noble Tells NewSpring Leaders Who Declared Him Biblically Unfit      Sponsored Article     'I'm Not Ashamed' Movie Star on Playing Rachel Scott, Her New Devotional, and Texting Sadie Robertson (Interview)      Former Atheist Lee Strobel on 'The Case for Christ' Film and Why He's Encouraged Amid Post-Modern Society (Interview)       Former Atheist Lee Strobel: Here's How to Encourage Non-Christians to See 'The Case for Christ' Film      'Good Luck Charlie' Actress Leigh-Allyn Baker on Heartwarming New PureFlix Film 'Wish for Christmas' (Interview)      Pure Flix Founder David A.R.

Tyler Perry Star Tasha Smith -- Ditching My Scrub Husband Is Costing Me a Fortune

EXCLUSIVE

Actress Tasha Smith will think twice about getting hitched again -- the now ex-husband she calls a glorified assistant just scored a fat settlement in their divorce.  
According to the court docs ... the "Why Did I Get Married?" star has been ordered to hand over nearly $7k/month in spousal support to Keith Douglas. That's on top of the $50k she already shelled out to him in December.
As we previously reported ... their rocky marriage took some crazy twists, including mutual restraining orders, and both saying they feared for their lives.
The settlement wasn't a total loss for Tasha ... Keith had to give back her Mercedes.  
Unfortunately her friends all drive Porsches, but she'll make amends.

Tasha Smith & Keith Douglas OUT And ABOUT In LA + Ne-Yo's "R.E.D." Disc Gets September 18th RELEASE DATE!  
Jul 12 | by _YBF




Tasha Smith and her gorgeous husband, businessman Keith Douglas, were spotted out and about in LA yesterday.  See their pics inside and find out when Ne-Yo's next CD drops.
 

 Actress Tasha Smith and her husband, businessman/author Keith Douglas were spotted at a Starbucks in Los Angeles yesterday.


 Tasha is on break from filming 'Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse', which returns on Friday, July 13th at 9 pm ET/PT on TBS.


 Also, Tasha and her husband recently launched their own unisex fragrance, 'Us'.
 
 
 
And in music news......

Ne-Yo and Motown Records have announced that the singer's next disc, R.E.D. (Realizing Every Dream) will hit stores Sept. 18.
The title, said Ne-Yo, “came from me stepping outside myself, looking at my life as it is today and realizing that every dream I’ve had from the day I decided I wanted to do music, every dream that I’ve had from then til now, I’m definitely on the way to realizing it.” 
The album will feature production work from Phat Boize, Salaam Remi, and a cameo from Fabolous.  And Ne-Yo also dedicated "Alone With You" to his two-year old daughter Maddy (Madilyn Grace) who upon being brought home from the hospital as a newborn, cried and cried until this song was randomly played.

Will you get it?

    I'm not really sure who this Tasha Smith lady is but i heard she's a co-star on B.E.T's "The Game" or in a couple Tyler Ferry movies. Anyhoo.....I refuse to get FLEECED by any Tyler Ferry "Movie" which actually belongs on cable channel numbers 120 thru 199. His next movie should be called:  Tyler Perry & Madea Take You (and your wallet) To The Cleaners <----------------

    I am waiting to see whatelse Tasha can play beside loud, ghetto, street. She needs to step away from Tyler if she wants to diversify herself, I know TP is cutting checks but I am sure she will want to grow as an artist and I don't see that happening if she continues to ride the TP gravy train.

Actress Tasha Smith and her husband Keith Douglas live in the same house, but they can’t get too close, according to a new court order.
Tasha must reportedly stay two yards away from Douglas when they’re home together and 100 yards away when they’re not.
Douglas claims the Why Did I Get Married star has threatened him on multiple occasions, sometimes even in front of the children. The TMZ report claims Douglas once feared falling asleep because of what Smith “might do.”

The report also claims Smith’s ‘threats’ are often accompanied by alcoholic rages.
The judge who heard Douglas’ case did not want to force Smith to leave the home until after a hearing, so the restraining order requires a minimum of two yards distance when they are in the house.
Someone call Tyler Perry – things are getting out of control.
