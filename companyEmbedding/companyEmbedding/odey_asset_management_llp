Odey


















To be a successful long term investor you must think like an owner - know when to take risk and when to preserve capital.

I launched Odey Asset Management in 1991 with this 'owners' approach and have worked hard to build an investment team and a client base who share these beliefs. Today we manage c. $6.0bn* for many of the world's leading investors and have an exceptional performance record across our conventional and hedge fund portfolios (* as at 30 June 2017).

If you would like to learn more about us, please do get in touch.

States unless those persons or entities are existing investors in

Accordingly, all persons who access this site are required to
inform themselves of and to comply with all applicable sales
restrictions in their home country. 
Sales Restrictions
United Kingdom: certain of the funds referred to in the
restricted part of this site (the "Restricted Area") more commonly
known as hedge funds are not recognised collective investment
schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 of the United Kingdom (the "Act"). The promotion of such funds
and the distribution of offering materials in relation to such
funds in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law.

available to and directed only at persons to whom such funds may
lawfully be promoted by a person authorised under the Act (an
"authorised person") by virtue of Section 238(5) of the Act and

The hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not regulated under
the UK's financial services regulations and investors in those

the Act for the protection of investors or from the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme.
Shares in the hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not dealt
in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the
purposes of the Act, nor is there a market maker in such shares,

shares.

this site should only be made having read fully the relevant

on this site, you should contact your financial adviser.
Risk Factors

performance. The value of investments and the income from them may
go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount
invested. Consequently, you are not certain to make a profit on
your investments and you may lose money.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area may be subject to higher
risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.
Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and
the income arising from them to rise or fall.
The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change.
Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their
value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor.
Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to
understand any applicable tax consequences.

Company Description


OAM is an active, research-oriented manager which aims to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in listed securities issued by companies based in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany. They do not limit themselves to a specific investment style and exit positions and convictions when necessary in order to do 'what is right now'.The firm relies on both fundamental and technical analysis. They believe that fundamental analysis is necessary but that its importance is limited by the fact that markets are very efficient in absorbing and valuing information. They therefore rely on technical analysis to complement their fundamental research, aiming to identify attractive investment opportunities ahead of the market.In-house research, is supplemented by a network of London-based and international brokers, proprietary industry sources, analytical databases and contacts with senior management.

Robin Crispin William Odey (born January 1959)[2][3] is a London-based hedge fund manager and the founding partner of Odey Asset Management. In April 2011 the firm had $6.5 to $7 billion under management, with Odey personally running $4 billion of assets.[4]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
