History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

	Excerpts from Transcript of Liberty Media Corporation Earnings Call Held on November 8, 2016






	 





	Jeffrey Wlodarczak, Analyst, Pivotal Research Group LLC





	 




	. . . I wanted to focus on F1. Greg, I was hoping you could comment on the potential for you all to create an F1 OTT product. At least to me it seems like something that could generate very attractive potential upside. Is that something you could roll out fairly quickly in the context of your F1 broadcast current rights? And then, Ive got a follow-up.




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Liberty Media Corp.





	 




	Thanks, Jeff. I think were also very excited about the idea to try and utilize the massive amounts of video feed and data that we have in a premium-type product. And given the global nature and extremely dedicated fan base we have, it would seem like an OTT product is something that makes a lot of sense for them and us.




	 




	We do have some things to work through on rights. I dont think theyre impenetrable, but therere things to be worked through. And we also just need to do  work out relationships with the teams and how we handle it all. So, theres not only some work on the product side, but there is some licensing work, but I dont think its insurmountable. How exactly the form of any product may take or what we may do, Im not yet sure, were still at early days. But I agree, theres a lot of potential.




	 





	Jeffrey Wlodarczak





	 




	Thanks. And then more broadly at this point, is it reasonable to assume at F1 that perhaps you may have to take a step back financially before two steps forward as youre investing or can you accelerate financial growth while youre investing?




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	I think were still trying to get a handle on that exactly. I dont anticipate massive reduction in operating performance. There are some positives coming in including incremental broadcast revenue in some cases. But I do think well be making some investments, but part of its in management, part of its in areas like the OTT product that you just mentioned. I dont think those are going to be massively dilutive, but I do think we will be making investments.




	 




	. . .




	 





	Bryan Kraft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.





	 




	. . . [W]hen would . . . Formula 1 become [an] ATB?




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	. . . Formula 1 is a long way away.




	 





	Barton Crockett, Analyst, FBR Capital Markets & Co.





	 




	. . . First, on the arrangements with third-parties for the Formula 1 investment. Could you just give me the rationale for that? Is this mainly a way to help the owners of Formula 1 get cash quicker without having to be subject to a lock up or is there some idea that by using these third-parties that you might get people who would be longer term investors potentially than the core holders of Formula 1?




	 












	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	. . . One is, yeah, the CVC group, the legacy owners, have been in for a long time. We did give them some cash and they made the bet that the continued ownership stake that they hold would grow under the management of Chase and Liberty. Theyve gotten some of that bounce already. But I think they see more upside. Theyre talking about potentially selling something like a third of what they have left, which will leave them still with about half of what they had when we started being involved. Well see how those exact numbers shake out.




	 




	Importantly, one of the groups thats being discussed as an investor to take some of their stake, instead of the minority of their stake, is the teams themselves. And we would consider that quite a positive in terms of anchoring our relationship and aligning our interest with the teams. I also think everybody is interested in getting long-term shareholders who are potentially additive to the business but certainly expect to be in for the long positive ride that we are anticipating. So, I think CVC and we are aligned on that.




	 




	. . .




	 





	Benjamin Daniel Swinburne, Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC





	 




	. . . I wanted to come back to Formula 1, maybe for Mark. At this point with the margin loan I think closing next couple of days, is the financing all in place to close the second piece of the transaction, and any thoughts on permanent financing for the margin loan piece? I assume thats something youre going to keep sort of in perpetuity.




	 





	Mark D. Carleton, Chief Financial Officer, Liberty Media Corp.





	 




	Yeah, I think the financing is all in place right now. We, obviously, as we do with all of our companies, look at financing alternatives and different ways to be more efficient at our financing and more efficient and focused with our leverage, but everything is in place now to do what we need to do, and well keep our eye on the markets and whats happening. And when the time comes, certainly when we get to closing this transaction, well be able to have a lot more direct involvement in that financing and what we do with it. But were paying attention.




	 





	Benjamin Daniel Swinburne





	 




	And then on just on tax. The tax position at Formula 1 as it gets folded into Liberty, very free cash flow generative business, I noted there are some tax assets  well, not tax assets but some tax losses in your proxy filing. What do you expect if any leakage in terms of up-streaming cash flow out of Formula 1 to the parent over time? Should we be assuming thats sort of tax free? Are we looking at a UK tax rate? Any helpful thoughts would be helpful.




	 





	Albert E. Rosenthaler, Chief Corporate Development Officer, Liberty Media Corp.





	 




	. . . With respect to Formula 1, we retain their tax NOLs and position with respect to taxability in the UK. As we noted earlier, there are some changes anticipated in the UK tax rates and with respect to the utilization of losses and interest deductions. So, that will have a modest increase in the UK taxes. We were able to set up the acquisition structure such that we do not believe there is any incremental tax on the repatriation of earnings back to the U.S., though.




	 




	. . .




	 




	[T]hat should have been able to replicate their structure.




	 





	Benjamin Daniel Swinburne





	 




	. . . And then lastly, just the FIA, can you just maybe spend a minute on the relationship between the FIA and Formula 1, and whether you  Im assuming you do, but just any color on the approval of the FIA for this transaction. I think the deal closing is subject to their approval.




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	Youre correct, it is subject to their approval. Chase Carey and I have met with the FIA, in particular, Jean Todt, the head of the FIA, several times and had good conversations with him. Were proceeding forward with the necessary processes they have for change of control, and I have every reason to believe well have a favorable outcome.




	 












	 




	. . .




	 





	Thomas W. Eagan, Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group LLC





	 




	And then, separately on Liberty Media. With the investment in F1, what does that mean regarding the Live Nation investment? Is that still fit in the current vehicle and are there operational synergies between F1 and Live Nation?




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	I think there are  Ill handle the second part first, I think there are places where Live Nation can be helpful to Formula 1. There are some involvements already. For example, Live Nation has helped organize concerts around some of the racing events. Live Nation has helped with some of the general venue and set up and event processes and event ticketing and the like, for example, in Singapore. And there are places I think that they can be positive for each other but particularly where Live Nation can help Formula 1. F1 and Live Nation are not in the same business. I think that stake is important, but obviously, the stake in Live Nation is smaller than the stake in F1. Well see where the  or what the eventual size of our F1 business will be, well see where the right place for that is.




	 




	. . .




	 





	Jason Boisvert Bazinet, Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.





	 




	. . . [W]hen you announced the Formula 1 transaction, I dont remember you guys ever sort of explicitly citing the value of tax assets. We just got that the tax rate would be low and you could repatriate it back to the U.S., I remember that. But is there an explicit value that were missing when we think about the value of this asset?




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	. . . [T]here is no explicit tax asset other than I think we have, as we said, an attractive low tax rate structure and a full basis in our ability to repatriate capital.




	 





	Albert E. Rosenthaler





	 




	There are some losses.




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	There are - Albert, theres some losses . . .




	 





	Albert E. Rosenthaler





	 




	Theres some losses, but its not as large as - the overall rate is quite low given the structure that we have.




	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	Theres not a significant tax asset at all.




	 




	. . .




	 





	Matthew J. Harrigan, Analyst, Wunderlich Securities, Inc.





	 




	. . . Youve got so much going on over at F1 as well, and I know theyre working with Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight and all that on some of these new toys. How do you feel about how the rights for new technologies and new modes of viewing and experience get divvied up between the teams and the leagues, is that something that  I mean, the ownership structure over at F1 is so complicated . . . I know its kind of a fuzzy question, but theres just so much potential there.




	 












	 





	Gregory B. Maffei





	 




	Yeah. I dont think we have so much of an issue at F1 where I think we have much clearer title and much clearer path on rights.




	 





	Forward-Looking Statements





	 




	The foregoing communication includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the proposed acquisition by Liberty Media Corporation (Liberty) of Delta Topco Limited (Delta Topco) and its Formula 1 business (the proposed acquisition), the realization of expected synergies and benefits from the proposed acquisition, market potential, future third party investments in Formula 1, future financial prospects, matters relating to changes in UK tax law, business strategies relating to Formula 1 (including with respect to content distribution), new opportunities for commercial partnerships, and other matters that are not historical facts.  These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of conditions to the proposed acquisition.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the foregoing communication, and Liberty expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Libertys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Liberty, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for risks and uncertainties related to Libertys business which may affect the statements made in this communication.




	 





	Additional Information





	 




	Nothing in the foregoing communication shall constitute a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of Libertys Series C Liberty Media common stock or any other series of its common stock.  Liberty stockholders and other investors are urged to read the proxy statement (a preliminary filing of which has been made with the SEC) because it will contain important information relating to the proposed acquisition.  Copies of Libertys SEC filings are available free of charge at the SECs website (http://www.sec.gov).  Copies of the filings together with the materials incorporated by reference therein will also be available, without charge, by directing a request to Investor Relations, (720) 875-5420.




	 





	Participants in a Solicitation





	 




	The directors and executive officers of Liberty and other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of any proposals relating to the proposed acquisition.  Information regarding the directors and executive officers of Liberty is available in its definitive proxy statement, which was filed with the SEC on July 8, 2016, and certain of its Current Reports on Form 8-K. Other information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be available in the proxy materials regarding the proposed acquisition (a preliminary filing of which has been made with the SEC).  Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
