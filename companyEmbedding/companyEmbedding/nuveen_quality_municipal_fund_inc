The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Please see the end notes for expense ratio and other important disclosures. Category expense ratios represent category averages for all funds in the corporate bond category as defined by Morningstar. The average net expense ratio for ETFs in the category is 19 bps and for active and passive mutual funds combined, I-Shares only, it is 57 bps.

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale."

Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale."

One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%.

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale."

Nuveen Announces Updates to Closed-End Fund Product Line






October 06, 2014 09:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nuveen Investments, a leading global provider of investment services to 
      institutions as well as individual investors, today announced the 
      addition of several closed-end funds to the Nuveen platform. Minnesota 
      Municipal Income Portfolio Inc. (NYSE: MXA) and First American Minnesota 
      Municipal Income Fund II, Inc. (NYSE: MXN) have merged into a newly 
      organized closed-end fund, now known as the Nuveen Minnesota Municipal 
      Income Fund (NYSE: NMS), managed by Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC and 
      sub-advised by Nuveen Asset Management, LLC. The Nuveen Minnesota 
      Municipal Income Fund will have an initial net asset value (NAV) equal 
      to that of MXA. A summary regarding the NAV and the exchange ratios at 
      which common shares of each fund were exchanged for common shares of NMS 
      can be found in the tables below:

The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
