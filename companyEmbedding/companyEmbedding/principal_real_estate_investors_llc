Set up a family trust, using tax and investment strategies that are well suited to help meet your goals
Leverage beneficiary designation options that can help reduce estate taxes and help your loved ones get the maximum value of your estate

 
We can also help address some of the more unique and sophisticated needs of our clients through our Delaware based affiliate, BMO Delaware Trust Company.

Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

What we do       




How does BMO Wealth Management protect my personal information?


To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.




How does BMO Wealth Management collect my personal information?


We collect your personal information, for example, when you:
			 

open an account or seek financial advice about your investments
make deposits or withdrawals from your account
enter into an investment advisory contract
provide account information updates upon request from us


			We may also collect your personal information from affiliates and other companies.




Why can't I limit all sharing?


Federal law gives you the right to limit only: 
			 

sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes-information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you


			State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more information on your rights under state law.




What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?


If you have a joint account, your choices will apply to everyone on your account – unless you tell us otherwise.




 
 




Definitions

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations
CFP

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

Principal Real Estate Investors is the dedicated real estate investment group within Principal Global Investors. We build on a vertically integrated platform that incorporates all disciplines of commercial real estate. By providing access to opportunities across the spectrum of public and private equity and debt investments, our clients are able to customize their real estate portfolios to their specific objectives, including sustainability and risk management guidelines.

Specialized expertise across four real estate quadrants
Our capabilities are backed by more than 60 years of real estate investment experience, when we started as part of the real estate investment department of Principal Life Insurance Company.
Since then, we’ve built a top-tier investment platform that provides comprehensive, specialized capabilities across all four quadrants of commercial real estate—public equity, private equity, public debt, and private debt. This platform gives us a unique perspective on real estate space and capital markets, allowing us to deliver solutions that meet your investment goals. 

Our platform offers:
Broad market access
Our diverse investment teams, located in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia, have deep relationships within the industry, giving us preferred access to commercial real estate investment opportunities. This broad access also contributes to our research, allowing us to continuously incorporate real-time data and information into our underwriting and investment decisions.

Research-based investing
Our investment process is team-oriented, multi-disciplined, and research-based. Research is fundamental to our ability to assess relative value both within and across quadrants, and to deliver on your investment goals. The foundation for our investment decisions is a combination of top-down economic and sector analysis with bottom-up asset analysis, providing our investment professionals with the insights they need to successfully execute strategies.

Consistent, risk-adjusted performance
Our goal is to deliver consistent, risk-adjusted performance and superior service. Our market reach and research are vital to achieving this goal—and so is our commitment to innovation, whether it be sustainable investing or the “next generation” investment strategy or solution.

                        It took 21 days from signing our contract to having our system deployed to our investors. All we had to do was give the Juniper Square team access to our spreadsheets and systems, and they took care of the rest. The team is professional, they know real estate and our business, and they make the process painless. I can highly recommend Juniper Square.

OUR APPROACH




A well thought out estate plan is critical to helping protect and transition your wealth for the next generation.

Our trust and estate professionals can work with your legal advisors to help you:

Manage your estate plan1, helping to ensure a smooth transition of wealth to the next generation
Set up a family trust, using tax and investment strategies that are well suited to help meet your goals
Leverage beneficiary designation options that can help reduce estate taxes and help your loved ones get the maximum value of your estate

 
We can also help address some of the more unique and sophisticated needs of our clients through our Delaware based affiliate, BMO Delaware Trust Company. 
 
Whether we are helping you manage a comprehensive trust and estate plan, providing trust and estate administrative services or delivering guidance and support to your advisors, we offer advice that integrates within your overall financial picture, helping you make the best decisions about the future of your wealth.

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

How does CTC | myCFO
collect my personal information?


We collect your personal information, for example, when you:
 

open an account or give us your contact information


provide account information or seek advice about your investments
enter into an investment advisory contract

 
We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.

sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes-information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you


			State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more information on your rights under state law.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

What we do       




How does BMO Wealth Management protect my personal information?


To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.




How does BMO Wealth Management collect my personal information?


We collect your personal information, for example, when you:
			 

open an account or seek financial advice about your investments
make deposits or withdrawals from your account
enter into an investment advisory contract
provide account information updates upon request from us


			We may also collect your personal information from affiliates and other companies.




Why can't I limit all sharing?

sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes-information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you


			State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more information on your rights under state law.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations
CFP

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
