The Legal Proceedings section in your prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following:     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     We and our subsidiaries, like other life insurance companies, are subject to regulatory and legal proceedings in     the ordinary course of our business. Certain of the proceedings we are involved in assert claims for substantial     amounts. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of any pending or future case,     legal proceeding or regulatory action, we do not expect the ultimate result of any of these actions to result in a     material adverse effect on the Separate Account, our ability to meet our obligations under the Policies, or AIC's     ability to perform its obligations. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of     these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain     matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on any or all of the above.All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus as previously supplemented.

We have filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") seeking an orderapproving the substitution of shares of the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial Class for shares of theCalvert VP Money Market Portfolio.The effect of the substitution would permit us to replace the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio (\"Existing Fund\")with the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio (\"Replacement Fund\") as an investment option under the Policies.The Existing Fund and Replacement Fund are described in their respective summary prospectuses, which areavailable at no charge by contacting Customer Service at 1-800-745-1112, or by logging into your account on theinternet service center at Ameritas.com.Until the date of the substitution, Policy value currently allocated to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio mayremain invested in the corresponding Subaccount, and transfers of Policy value into and out of that Subaccount willbe allowed. Any allocation to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio pursuant to an asset allocation model willcontinue according to the model until the date of any substitution unless we receive different allocation instructionsfrom you.We anticipate the substitution will occur on or around November 15, 2013. From the date of this supplement to thedate of the substitution, if you have allocations to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio Subaccount, you maytransfer such allocations to any other available Subaccount without any charge or limitation (except potentiallyharmful transfers (see “Disruptive Trading Procedures” in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer counting towardthe number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year.If carried out, the proposed substitution would result in any Policy value you have allocated to the Subaccountfunded by the Existing Fund being, in effect, transferred at relative net asset value to a Subaccount investing in theReplacement Fund. We will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution. There would be no taxconsequences resulting from this exchange. After the substitution, the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund willno longer be available for investment under the Policy.Once the substitution occurs, unless you instruct us otherwise, any existing or future instruction that designates theSubaccount funded by the Existing Fund will be deemed to be an instruction for the Subaccount funded by theReplacement Fund. This includes, but is not limited to, instructions for purchase payments, partial withdrawals,and transfer instructions (including instructions under any automatic or systematic transfer option). All references inyour prospectus to the Existing Fund will be replaced with a reference to the Replacement Fund.From the date of the substitution, until at least thirty (30) days after the substitution, you are permitted to transferPolicy value out of the Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund to one or more other Subaccounts or thefixed account (if available) within the Policy without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers(see “Disruptive Trading Procedures” in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer being treated as one of a limitednumber of free transfers allowed under your Policy. If you would like to make a transfer of Policy value, pleasecontact Customer Service at 1-800-745-1112, or log into your account on the internet service center atAmeritas.com.Information about the Replacement Fund, its investment policy, risks, fees and expenses and other aspects of itsoperations, can be found in its prospectus, which you should read carefully. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THATANY NEW FUND WILL ACHIEVE ITS STATED OBJECTIVE.If you have any questions about this proposed substitution, please contact a Customer Service representative at1-800-745-1112.All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus, as previously supplemented.

You can allocate your premiumsamong a wide spectrum of investments and transfer money from one underlying investment portfolio to anotherwithout tax liability.

The investmentoptions are described on this prospectus' cover and the INVESTMENT OPTIONS section.

Some restrictions may apply to transfers (especiallyto transfers out of the Fixed Account). Withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge, income tax and apenalty tax.

We may also deduct awithdrawal charge from Policy value on the date annuity income payments begin from amounts applied to provideannuity payments. We do not assess a withdrawal charge on premiums after the second year since receipt that areapplied to the Life or Joint and Last Survivor annuity income options. This charge partially covers our distributioncosts, including commissions and other promotional costs. Any deficiency is met from our general account,including amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charge.          The amount of a partial withdrawal you request plus any withdrawal charge is deducted from the Policyvalue on the date we receive your withdrawal request. Partial withdrawals (including any charge) are deducted fromthe Subaccounts and the Fixed Account on a pro rata basis, unless you instruct us otherwise. The oldest premium isconsidered to be withdrawn first, the next oldest premium is considered to be withdrawn next, and so on (a \"first-in,first-out\" basis). All premiums are deemed to be withdrawn before any earnings.           Optional Withdrawal Charge Features          The optional withdrawal charge features carry the following additional current fees which are deductedmonthly from Policy value to equal this annual percentage of Policy value: 0.35% for the Optional 7-YearWithdrawal Charge (guaranteed to never exceed 0.40%), and 0.50% for the Optional 5-Year Withdrawal Charge(guaranteed to never exceed 0.60%). These fees continue as long as the Policy is in force. Your election of one ofthe optional withdrawal charge features must be made at issue of the Policy, and only if you are not older than age70 at issue of the Policy.           Optional Free Withdrawal Features          The base Policy does not have any free withdrawal features (allowing withdrawals not subject to awithdrawal charge). Two optional free withdrawal features are available: See the prospectus’ POLICYDISTRIBUTIONS: Withdrawals section of this prospectus for details about these features. These optionalfeatures have current fees which are deducted monthly from Policy value to equal this annual percentage of Policyvalue: 0.10% for the Optional 10% Free Withdrawal Privilege (guaranteed to never exceed 0.15%), and 0.35% forthe Enhanced Free Withdrawal Privilege (guaranteed to never exceed 0.40%). MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE          ¾ We impose a daily fee to compensate us for the mortality and expense risks we have under the Policy.This fee is equal to an annual rate of 0.75% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account, and is guaranteedto never exceed an annual rate of 0.85%. This fee is reflected in the Accumulation Unit values for each Subaccount.          Our mortality risk arises from our obligation to make annuity payments and to pay death benefits prior tothe Annuity Date. The mortality risk we assume is that annuitants will live longer than we project, so our cost inmaking annuity payments will be higher than projected. However, an Annuitant's own longevity, or improvement inDESIGNER ANNUITY                        -7-general life expectancy, will not affect the periodic annuity payments we pay under your Policy. Another mortalityrisk we assume is that at your death the death benefit we pay will be greater than the Policy value.          Our expense risk is that our costs to administer your Policy will exceed the amount we collect throughadministrative charges.          If the mortality and expense risk charge does not cover our costs, we bear the loss, not you. If the chargeexceeds our costs, the excess is our profit. If the withdrawal charge does not cover our Policy distribution costs, thedeficiency is met from our general account assets, which may include amounts, if any, derived from this mortalityand expense risk charge. ADMINISTRATIVE FEES          Administrative fees help us cover our cost to administer your Policy.          Administrative Expense Fee          ¾ This fee is equal to an annual rate of 0.20% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account, andis guaranteed to never exceed an annual rate of 0.25%. This fee is reflected in the Accumulation Unit values foreach Subaccount.          Annual Policy Fee          ¾ We reserve the right to charge an annual Policy fee not to exceed $40.           The optional Minimum Initial Premium feature has a current annual Policy fee of $40.          Any Policy Fee (currently only levied under the optional Minimum Initial Premium feature) is deductedfrom your Policy value on the last Business Day of each Policy Year and upon a complete surrender. This fee islevied by canceling Accumulation Units and making deductions from the Fixed Account. It is deducted from eachSubaccount and the Fixed Account in the same proportion that the value in each Subaccount or the Fixed Accountbears to the total Policy value. We currently waive any Policy Fee if the Policy value is at least $50,000 on a PolicyAnniversary. TRANSFER FEE          ¾ The first 15 transfers per Policy Year from Subaccounts or the Fixed Account are free. A transfer feeof $10 may be imposed for any transfer in excess of 15 per Policy Year. The transfer fee is deducted pro rata fromeach Subaccount (and, if applicable, the Fixed Account) in which the Owner is invested. TAX CHARGES          Some states and municipalities levy a tax on annuities, currently ranging from 0% to 3.5% of yourpremiums. These tax rates, and the timing of the tax, vary and may change. Presently, we deduct the charge for thetax in those states with a tax either (a) from premiums as they are received, or (b) upon applying proceeds to anannuity income option.          No charges are currently made for taxes other than premium taxes. We reserve the right to levy charges inthe future for taxes or other economic burdens resulting from taxes that we determine are properly attributable to theSeparate Account. FEES CHARGED BY THE PORTFOLIOS          ¾ Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio has investment advisory fees and expenses. They are set forthin this prospectus' CHARGES section and described in more detail in each fund's prospectus. A portfolio's fees andexpenses are not deducted from your Policy value. Instead, they are reflected in the daily value of portfolio shareswhich, in turn, will affect the daily Accumulation Unit value of the Subaccounts. These fees and expenses help topay the portfolio's investment advisory and operating expenses. OPTIONAL FEATURES’ FEES           Each of the optional features is principally described in the prospectus sections noted below:Optional Feature       Prospectus Section Where It Is Covered optional Minimum Initial Premium feature ..................................

Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options          We do not control the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios, so we cannot guarantee that any of the portfolioswill always be available.          We retain the right to change the investments of the Separate Account, and to eliminate the shares of anySubaccount's underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another series fund portfolio, if the shares of theunderlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if, in our judgment, investment in the portfolio wouldbe inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Separate Account. We may add new Separate Account underlyingportfolios or eliminate existing underlying portfolios, when, in our sole discretion, conditions warrant a change. Inall of these situations, we will receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making any such change.          Our Separate Account may be (i) operated as an investment management company or any other formpermitted by law, (ii) deregistered with the SEC if registration is no longer required, or (iii) combined with one ormore other separate accounts. To the extent permitted by law, we also may transfer assets of the Separate Accountto other accounts. Where permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to remove, combine or add Subaccounts.Subaccounts may be closed to new or subsequent premium payments, transfers or premium allocations. We willreceive any necessary SEC and state approval before making any of these changes.We will notify you of any changes to the variable investment options.■ Resolving Material Conflicts – Underlying Investment Interests          In addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the Subaccounts, the portfolios are available to registeredseparate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. Wedo not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fundother products. However, there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between Policy Ownersand the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios.Shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying undersection 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arisebetween the interests of Owners or owners of other contracts (including contracts issued by other companies), andsuch retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans. In the event of a material conflict, we will take anynecessary steps to resolve the matter, including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of theSeparate Account. The Board of Directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify anymaterial conflicts that may arise and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to those events orconflicts. See the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information. (Also see the Transferssection, Omnibus Orders.) FIXED ACCOUNT INVESTMENT OPTION          There is one fixed interest rate option (\"Fixed  All amounts allocated to the Fixed Account becomeAccount\"), where we bear the investment risk.

Assetsin the Fixed Account are subject to claims by creditors of the company. The focus of this prospectus is to disclosethe Separate Account aspects of the Policy. TRANSFERS          The Policy is designed for long-term investment, not for use with professional \"market timing\" services oruse with programmed, large or frequent transfers. Excessive transfers could harm other Policy Owners by having adetrimental effect on investment portfolio management. We reserve the right to reject any specific premiumallocation or transfer request, if in the judgment of a Subaccount portfolio fund advisor, a Subaccount portfoliowould be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies, or if Policy ownerswould otherwise potentially be adversely affected.           Subject to restrictions during the \"right to examine period\" and prior to the Annuity Date, you may transferPolicy value from one Subaccount to another, from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account, or from the FixedAccount to any Subaccount, subject to these rules:DESIGNER ANNUITY                             - 11 -Transfer Rules:          $ A transfer is considered any single request to move assets from one or more Subaccounts or the Fixed             Account to one or more of the other Subaccounts or the Fixed Account.          $ We must receive notice of the transfer B either Written Notice, an authorized telephone transaction, or by             Internet when available.          $ The transferred amount must be at least $250, or the entire Subaccount or Fixed Account value if it is             less. (If the value remaining after a transfer will be less the $250 in a Subaccount or $100 in the Fixed             Account, we will include that amount as part of the transfer.)             B If the Dollar Cost Averaging systematic transfer program is used, then the minimum transfer amount                   out of a Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the balance in the Subaccount or                   Fixed Account. Under this program, the maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed                   Account each month is 1/36th of the value of the Fixed Account at the time the Dollar Cost                   Averaging program is established. While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in effect, elective                   transfers out of the Fixed Account are prohibited.             B The Portfolio Rebalancing and Earnings Sweep systematic transfer programs have no minimum                   transfer limits.          $ The first 15 transfers each Policy Year are free. Thereafter, transfers may result in a $10 charge for each             transfer. This fee is deducted on a pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed             Account; it is not subtracted from the amount of the transfer. Transfers under any systematic transfer             program do count toward the 15 free transfer limit.          $ A transfer from the Fixed Account (except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program):             B may be made only once each Policy Year;             B may be delayed up to six months;             B is limited during any Policy Year to the greater of:                   B 25% of the Fixed account value on the date of the initial transfer during that year;                   B the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the Fixed Account during the previous 13                         months; or                   B $1,000.          $ We reserve the right to limit transfers, or to modify transfer privileges, and we reserve the right to change             the transfer rules at any time.          $ If the Policy value in any Subaccount falls below $100, we may transfer the remaining balance, without             charge, proportionately to the remaining investment options you selected in your latest allocation             instructions. We will notify you when such a transfer occurs. You may, within 60 days of the date of             our notice, reallocate the amount transferred, without charge, to another investment option.          $ In the event you authorize telephone or Internet transfers, we are not liable for telephone or Internet             instructions that we in good faith believe you authorized. We will employ reasonable procedures to             confirm that instructions are genuine.          Omnibus Orders          Purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are \"omnibus\" orders fromintermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibusorders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants andindividual owners of variable insurance products. The omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of theportfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures. We cannot guarantee that theportfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies thatmay invest in the portfolios. These other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and proceduresregarding frequent transfer activity. If their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transferactivity, it will affect other owners of portfolio shares, as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variableannuity contracts, including ours, whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios. Inaddition, if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests fromOwners engaged in disruptive trading, the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or preventus from implementing your request. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES          Where permitted and subject to our rules, we may accept your authorization to have a third party (such asyour sales representative or someone else you name) exercise transfers or investment allocations on your behalf.Third-party transfers and allocations are subject to the same rules as all other transfers and allocations. You canmake this election on the application or by sending us Written Notice. Please note that any person or entity youauthorize to make transfers or allocations on your behalf, including any investment advisory, asset allocation, moneymanagement or timing service, does so independently from any agency relationship they may have with us for thesale of the Policies. They are accountable to you alone for such transfers or allocations. We are not responsible forsuch transfers or allocations on your behalf, or recommendations to you, by such third-party services. You shouldbe aware that fees charged by such third parties for their service are separate from and in addition to fees paid underthe Policy.DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 12 - DISRUPTIVE TRADING PROCEDURES          The Policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in      Organizations or individualsresponse to short-term fluctuations in the market. Such frequent trading,               that use market timingprogrammed transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of a  investment strategies andSubaccount’s underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a Subaccount’sunderlying portfolio and raise expenses. This in turn can hurt performance of an make frequent or otheraffected Subaccount and therefore hurt your Policy’s performance.                       disruptive transfers shouldPolicy Owners should be aware that we are contractually obligated to not purchase the Policyprovide Policy Owner transaction data relating to trading activities to theunderlying funds on written request and, on receipt of written instructions from a fund, to restrict or prohibit furtherpurchases of transfers by Policy Owners identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions thatviolate the trading policies of the fund.          We reserve the right to reject or restrict, in our sole discretion, transfers initiated by a market timingorganization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions. We further reserve the right toimpose restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially hurt therights or interests of other Policy Owners. Restrictions may include changing, suspending or terminating telephone,on-line and facsimile transfer privileges. We will also enforce any Subaccount underlying portfolio manager’s ownrestrictions imposed upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive. Our disruptive trading proceduresmay vary from Subaccount to Subaccount, and may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contractprovisions. Any Subaccount restrictions will be uniformly applied.          There is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in preventing market timing or otherexcessive transfer activity. Our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptivetrading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations. The discretionary nature ofour disruptive trading procedures may result in some Policy Owners being able to market time, while other PolicyOwners bear the harm associated with timing. Also, because other insurance companies and retirement plans mayinvest in Subaccount underlying portfolios, we cannot guarantee that Subaccount underlying portfolios will not sufferharm from disruptive trading within contracts issued by them.Excessive TransfersWe reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are engaging in a pattern of transfers that maydisadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we will consider, among other things: the total dollar amount being transferred; the number of transfers you make over a period of time; whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations,     particularly within certain Subaccount underlying portfolios; whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of individual     Policy Owners in the group; and the investment objectives and/or size of the Subaccount underlying portfolio.          Third Party Traders          We reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transferson behalf of multiple Policy Owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a pattern of transfers thatmay disadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we may, among other things:      reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one          Policy Owner, or      reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual Policy Owners who have executed transfer forms          which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Policy Owner.          We will notify affected Policy Owners before we limit transfers, modify transfer procedures or refuse tocomplete a transfer. Transfers made pursuant to participation in a dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, orearnings sweep program are not subject to these rules, nor are they subject to a transfer fee. See the sections of theProspectus describing those programs for the rules of each program. SYSTEMATIC TRANSFER PROGRAMS          We offer several systematic transfer programs. We reserve the right to alter, assess a charge, or terminatethese programs upon thirty days advance written notice.! Dollar Cost Averaging Program          Dollar Cost Averaging allows you to automatically transfer, on a periodic basis, a set dollar amount orpercentage from the Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account to any other Subaccount(s) or the FixedAccount. Requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount. You can begin Dollar Cost Averaging when youpurchase the Policy or later. You can increase or decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue theprogram at any time. Dollar Cost Averaging is intended to limit loss by resulting in the purchase of moreAccumulation Units when a portfolio's value is low, and fewer units when its value is high. However, there is noguarantee that such a program will result in a higher Policy value, protect against a loss, or otherwise achieve yourinvestment goals.DESIGNER ANNUITY                           - 13 -Dollar Cost Averaging Rules:          $ There is no additional charge for the Dollar Cost Averaging program.          $ We must receive notice of your election and any changed instruction B either Written Notice, by             telephone transaction instruction, or by Internet when available.          $ Automatic transfers can only occur monthly.          $ The minimum transfer amount out of the Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of             $250 or the balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program, the maximum amount that             may be transferred from the Fixed Account each month is 1/36th of the Fixed Account value at the time             Dollar Cost Averaging is established. While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in effect, elective             transfers out of the Fixed Account are prohibited. There is no maximum transfer amount limitation             applicable to any of the Subaccounts.          $ Dollar Cost Averaging program transfers cannot begin before the end of a Policy's \"right to examine\"             period.          $ You may specify that transfers be made on the 1st through the 28th day of the month. Transfers will be             made on the date you specify (or if that is not a Business Day, then on the next Business Day). If you do             not select a date, the program will begin on the next Policy month anniversary following the date the             Policy's \"right to examine\" period ends.          $ You can limit the number of transfers to be made, in which case the program will end when that number             has been made. Otherwise, the program will terminate when the amount remaining in the Money Market             Subaccount or the Fixed Account is less than $100.          $ Dollar Cost Averaging is not available when Portfolio Rebalancing is elected.! Portfolio Rebalancing Program          The Portfolio Rebalancing program allows you to rebalance your Policy value among designatedSubaccounts only as you instruct.

The change will apply to premiums received on or after the date we receive your Written             Notice or authorized telephone transaction.          $ All premiums will be allocated pursuant to your instructions on record with us, except your initial             premium and any additional premiums received during your Policy's \"right to examine\" period may be             subject to special requirements. YOUR POLICY VALUE          On your Policy's date of issue, the Policy value equals the initial premium less any charge for applicablepremium taxes. On any Business Day thereafter, the Policy value equals the sum of the values in the SeparateAccount variable investment options and the Fixed Account. The Policy value is expected to change from day today, reflecting the expenses and investment experience of the selected variable investment options (and interestearned in the Fixed Account options) as well as the deductions for fees under the Policy.! Separate Account Value          Premiums or transfers allocated to Subaccounts are accounted for in Accumulation Units. The Policy valueheld in the Separate Account Subaccounts on any Business Day is determined by multiplying each Subaccount'sAccumulation Unit value by the number of accumulation units held in the Subaccount allocated to the Policy. EachSubaccount's Accumulation Unit value is calculated at the end of each Business Day as follows:DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 15 -(a) the per share net asset value of the Subaccount's underlying portfolio as of the end of the current     Business Day plus any dividend or capital gain distribution declared and unpaid by the underlying     portfolio during that Business Day, times the number of shares held by the Subaccount, before the     purchase or redemption of any shares on that date; minus(b) the daily administrative expense fee; minus(c) the daily mortality and expense risk charge; and this result divided by(d) the total number of Accumulation Units held in the Subaccount on the Business Day before the     purchase or redemption of any Accumulation Units on that day.          When transactions are made to or from a Subaccount, the actual dollar amounts are converted toAccumulation Units. The number of Accumulation Units for a transaction is equal to the dollar amount of thetransaction divided by the Accumulation Unit value on the Business Day the transaction is made.          An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Therecan be no assurance that the funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.! Fixed Account Value          The Policy value of the Fixed Account (the fixed interest rate investment option) on any Business Dayequals:          (a) the Policy value of the Fixed Account at the end of the preceding Policy month; plus          (b) any net premiums credited since the end of the previous Policy month; plus          (c) any transfers from the Subaccounts credited to the Fixed Account since the end of the previous Policy                month; minus          (d) any transfers and transfer fee from the Fixed Account to the Subaccounts since the end of the previous                Policy month; minus          (e) any partial withdrawal and withdrawal charge taken from the Fixed Account since the end of the                previous Policy month; minus          (f) the Fixed Account's share of the annual Policy fee on the Policy Anniversary; minus          (g) the Fixed Account’s share of the charges for any optional features; plus          (h) interest credited on the Fixed Account balance. TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONSTelephone Transactions Permitted                              Telephone Transaction Rules:$ Transfers among investment options.                         $ Must be received by close of the New York Stock$ Establish systematic transfer programs.$ Change of premium allocations.

Owners.We are not liable for following telephone transaction instructions we reasonably believe to be genuine. DEATH OF ANNUITANT          Upon the annuitant’s death prior to 30 days before the Annuity Date, you may generally name a newannuitant. If any Owner is the annuitant, then upon that Owner’s death, the Policy’s applicable death benefitbecomes payable to the named beneficiary(ies). However, if the beneficiary is the deceased Owner’s spouse, thenupon that Owner’s death the spouse may be permitted under federal tax law to become the new Owner of the Policyand to name an annuitant and different beneficiaries. DELAY OF PAYMENTS          We will usually pay any amounts requested as a full surrender or partial withdrawal from the SeparateAccount within 7 days after we receive your Written Notice. We can postpone such payments or any transfers outof a Subaccount if: (i) the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday closings; (ii) trading on theNYSE is restricted; (iii) an emergency exists as determined by the SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonablypractical to dispose of securities, or not reasonably practical to determine the value of the net assets of the SeparateAccount; or (iv) the SEC permits delay for the protection of security holders. The applicable rules of the SEC willgovern as to whether the conditions in (iii) or (iv) exist.          We may defer payments of full surrender or partial withdrawals from the Fixed Account for up to 6 monthsfrom the date we receive your Written Notice.DESIGNER ANNUITY                                      - 16 - BENEFICIARY          You may change your beneficiary by sending Written Notice to us, unless the named beneficiary isirrevocable. Once we record and acknowledge the change, it is effective as of the date you signed the WrittenNotice. The change will not apply to any payments made or other action taken by us before recording. If the namedbeneficiary is irrevocable you may change the named beneficiary only by Written Notice signed by both you and thebeneficiary. If more than one named beneficiary is designated, and you fail to specify their interest, they will shareequally.          If there are joint Owners, the surviving joint Owner will be deemed the beneficiary, and the beneficiarynamed in the Policy application or subsequently changed will be deemed the contingent beneficiary. If both jointOwners die simultaneously, the death benefit will be paid to the contingent beneficiary.          If the beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the spouse may elect either to receive the death benefit, inwhich case the Policy will terminate, or to continue the Policy in force with the spouse as Owner.          If the named beneficiary dies before you, then your estate is the beneficiary until you name a newbeneficiary. MINOR OWNER OR BENEFICIARY          A minor may not own the Policy solely in the minor's name and cannot receive payments directly as aPolicy beneficiary. Contrary to common belief, in most states parental status does not automatically give parents thepower to provide an adequate release to us to make beneficiary payments to the parent for the minor's benefit. Aminor can \"own\" a Policy through the trustee of a trust established for the minor's benefit, or through the minor'snamed and court appointed guardian, who owns the Policy in his or her capacity as trustee or guardian. Where aminor is a named beneficiary, we are able to pay the minor's beneficiary payments to the minor's trustee or guardian.Some states allow us to make such payments up to a limited amount directly to parents. Parents seeking to have aminor's interest made payable to them for the minor's benefit are encouraged to check with their local court todetermine the process to be appointed as the minor's guardian; it is often a very simple process that can beaccomplished without the assistance of an attorney. If there is no adult representative able to give us an adequaterelease for payment of the minor's beneficiary interest, we will retain the minor's interest on deposit until the minorattains the age of majority. POLICY CHANGES          Any change to your Policy is only effective if on a form acceptable to us, and then only once it is receivedat our Service Office and recorded on our records. Information on how to contact us to determine what informationis needed and where you can get various forms for Policy changes is shown on this Prospectus' first two pages andlast page.  SPENDTHRIFT PROTECTION          An optional Spendthrift Protection Endorsement can be added to your Policy, at no extra cost, beforeannuity income benefits begin. Under this Endorsement, we will pay annuity benefits only to the Owner or to apayee named by the Owner before annuity benefits begin. The Endorsement seeks to protect annuity benefits fromattachment by the Owner’s or other payee’s creditors, and in doing so restricts the Owner’s or other payee’s rights toanticipate, assign, commute, transfer or otherwise alienate the proceeds of the annuity benefits. POLICY TERMINATION          We may treat any partial withdrawal that leaves a Policy value of less than $1,000 as a complete surrenderof the Policy. See this prospectus' POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS: Withdrawals section for more information.          If you have paid no premiums during the previous 36-month period, we have the right to pay you the totalvalue of your Policy in a lump sum and cancel the Policy if (i) the Policy value is less than $1,000 (does not apply toIRAs), or (ii) the paid-up life-time income annuity benefit at maturity, based on an accumulation of the Policy valueto maturity, would be less than $20 per month. We will not impose a withdrawal charge on involuntaryterminations.  OPTIONAL FEATURES      This Policy allows you the opportunity to select, and pay for, only those variable annuity policy features youwant by \"unbundling\" features that are often incorporated into a base variable annuity policy. Except for theoptional Spendthrift Protection feature, these optional features are currently only available at Policy issue, and mostare only available if you are then not older than age 70. Check with your sales representative or us before selectingan optional feature, as some may not be available in your state. Each of the optional features is principally describedin the prospectus sections noted below:DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 17 -Optional Feature              Prospectus Section Where It Is Covered optional Minimum Initial Premium feature ..................................

POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS: Withdrawals optional Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit features ................ POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS: Death BenefitsCharges for each of the optional features are shown in this prospectus’ CHARGES section.POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS  (= Optional Feature)          There are several ways to take all or part of your investment out of your Policy, both before and after theAnnuity Date. Tax penalties and withdrawal charges may apply to amounts taken out of your Policy before theAnnuity Date. Your Policy also provides a death benefit (including, for an additional charge, an optional featureguaranteed minimum death benefit) that may be paid upon your death prior to the Annuity Date. All or part of adeath benefit may be taxable. WITHDRAWALS          You may withdraw, by Written Notice, all or part of your         Withdrawals may be subject to:Policy's Cash Surrender Value prior to the Annuity Date. Amounts                ­ Income Taxwithdrawn (except for optional feature \"free\" partial withdrawals you           ­ Penalty Taxmay have elected, described below) are subject to a withdrawal charge.          ­ Withdrawal ChargeFollowing a full surrender of the Policy, or at any time the Policy valueis zero, all your rights in the Policy end. Total surrender requires you   Even so called \"free\" withdrawalsto return your Policy to us.                                               may be subject to the tax charges.          For purposes of the withdrawal charge only, premiums are deemed to be withdrawn before any earnings;this means that there may be no withdrawal charge if the amount of the withdrawal is less than or equal to premiumsreceived at least \"x\" years prior to the withdrawal and not considered having been previously withdrawn, where \"x\"is the number of years in the withdrawal charge period. Of premium considered withdrawn, the oldest premium isconsidered withdrawn first, the next oldest premium is considered withdrawn next, and so on (a \"first-in, first-out\"procedure). (This is different than taxation order, which generally considers the last premium withdrawn first – a\"last-in, first-out\" procedure.)Withdrawal Rules$ We will accept a withdrawal request signed by you on our form of Written Notice by mail or facsimile.$ A request for a systematic withdrawal plan must specify a date for the first payment, which must be the  1st through 28th day of the month.$ Minimum withdrawal is $250.$ We may treat any partial withdrawal that leaves a Policy value of less than $1,000 as a complete  surrender of the Policy.$ Withdrawal results in cancellation of Accumulation Units from each applicable Subaccount and  deduction of Policy value from any Fixed Account option. If you do not specify which investment  option(s) from which to take the withdrawal, it will be taken from each investment option in the  proportion that the Policy value in each investment option bears to the total Policy value.$ The total amount paid to you upon total surrender of the Policy (taking any prior partial withdrawals into  account) may be less than the total premiums made, because we will deduct any charges owed but not yet  paid (including withdrawal charges), a premium tax charge may apply to withdrawals, and because you  bear the investment risk for all amounts you allocate to the Separate Account.$ Unless you give us Written Notice not to withhold taxes from a withdrawal, we must withhold 10% of  the taxable amount withdrawn to be paid as a federal tax, as well as any amounts required by state laws  to be withheld for state income taxes.DESIGNER ANNUITY      - 18 -! Systematic Withdrawal Plan          The systematic withdrawal plan allows you to automatically withdraw payments of a pre-determined dollaramount or fixed percentage of Policy value from a specified investment option monthly, quarterly, semi-annually orannually. We can support and encourage your use of electronic fund transfer of systematic withdrawal planpayments to an account of yours that you specify to us. The fixed dollar amount of systematic withdrawals may becalculated in support of Internal Revenue Service minimum distribution requirements over the lifetime of theAnnuitant. No systematic withdrawal may be established after the 28th of each month. Although this plan mimicsannuity payments, each distribution is a withdrawal that may be taxable and subject to the charges and expensesdescribed above; you may wish to consult a tax advisor before requesting this plan.!  Optional \"Free\" Withdrawal Features          You may elect one of two optional \"free\" withdrawal features, for a charge. For information about thecharge for these features, see this prospectus’ CHARGES and CHARGES EXPLAINED sections. Your electionmust be made at issue of the Policy, and only if you are then not older than age 70.           Optional 10% \"Free\" Withdrawal Feature.          This optional feature allows you to withdraw, each Policy Year, up to 10% of your Policy value withoutdeduction of a withdrawal charge. Under this option, Policy value is considered withdrawn on the same basis as inthe base Policy (first premiums on a first-in first-out basis, then earnings). (This is different than taxation order,which generally considers the last premium withdrawn first – a \"last-in, first-out\" procedure.) The 10% amount isdetermined at the time the withdrawal is made and is reduced by all prior free withdrawals in that Policy Year. Ifyou do not withdraw the 10% amount in a Policy Year, you may not carry forward the unused \"free\" withdrawalamount into the next Policy Year.           Optional Enhanced \"Free\" Withdrawal Feature.          This optional feature allows you to withdraw, without a withdrawal charge, each Policy Year, up to thegreater of a stated percentage of your Policy value or any of your accumulated Policy earnings, minus prior \"free\"withdrawals taken since Policy issue. (Accumulated Policy earnings are the excess of the Policy value over the netof premiums paid less any previous withdrawals of premium.) Under this option, for purposes of the withdrawalcharge only, earnings are considered withdrawn before premium, and premium is considered withdrawn on a first-infirst-out basis. (This is different than taxation order, which generally considers the last premium withdrawn first – a\"last-in, first-out\" procedure.) The stated percentage of Policy value available as a \"free\" withdrawal each PolicyYear is 15% the first year, 30% the second year, and 45% the third and subsequent years. The percentage amount isdetermined at the time the withdrawal is made. LOANS (403B PLANS ONLY)          Loans are only available if your Policy is a Tax Sheltered Annuity (sometimes called a \"TSA\" or \"403(b)plan\") under federal tax law and your Policy value is at least $5,000. We do not charge any loan fee. These Ownerscan take loans from the Policy value beginning one year after the Policy is issued up to the Annuity Date, and cannottake out more than one loan each Policy year. Loans are subject to the terms of the Policy, the plan, and federal taxlaw. We reserve the right to modify the terms of a loan to comply with changes in applicable law, or to reject anyloan request if we believe it may violate the terms of the plan or applicable law. (We are not responsible forcompliance of a loan request with plan requirements.)          Minimum and Maximum Loan Amounts          Minimum - $1,000. Each loan must individually satisfy this minimum amount.          Maximum - We will calculate the maximum nontaxable loan amount based upon information provided bythe plan participant or the employer. Loans may be taxable if a participant has additional loans from other plans.The total of all your outstanding TSA loans must not exceed the lesser of (i) $50,000 reduced by the highestoutstanding balance owned during the previous 12 months, or (ii) 50% of your Policy value.          How Loans are Processed          We will accept a loan request signed by you on our form of Written Notice by mail or facsimile. All loansare made from our general account. We transfer Policy value to our general account as security for the loan. Thetransfer is made in proportion to assets in and among the Subaccounts and in the Fixed Account, unless you give usdifferent allocation instructions. No withdrawal charge is levied upon Policy value transfers related to loanprocessing. We are usually able to process a loan request within 7 Business Days.          Loan Interest          Interest rate charged on loan balance: currently 7% effective annual rate; guaranteed maximum rate is 8%.          Interest rate credited to Policy value that is collateral for the loan: currently 4.5% effective annual rate;guaranteed minimum rate is 3%.          Specific loan terms are disclosed at the time of loan application or issuance.DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 19 -Loan Repayment          Loans must be repaid within 5 years, or 20 years if the loan is used to purchase your principal residence.Loan repayments must be identified as such; if they aren’t, we’ll treat them as additional premium payments andthey will not reduce the outstanding loan. Loan repayments must be substantially level and made at least quarterly.Loan repayments will consist of principal and interest in amounts set forth in the loan agreement. Repayments areallocated to the Subaccounts and Fixed Account pursuant to your then current investment option allocationinstructions. Any repayment due under the loan that is unpaid for 90 days will cause the loan balance to becomeimmediately due without notice. The loan will then be treated as a deemed Policy distribution and reported asincome to be taxed to the Owner.          Policy Distributions, including Annuity Income Payments          While a loan is outstanding, any Policy distributions made, including annuity income payments, will bereduced by the amount of the outstanding loan plus accrued interest.          Transferring the Policy          We reserve the right to restrict any transfer of the Policy while a loan is outstanding. DEATH BENEFITS          We will pay the death benefit after we receive Due Proof of Death of an Owner’s death or as soonthereafter as we have sufficient information about the beneficiary to make the payment. Death benefits may bepaid pursuant to an annuity income option to the extent allowed by applicable law and any settlement agreement ineffect at your death. If the beneficiary does not make an annuity income option election within 60 days of ourreceipt of Due Proof of Death, we will issue a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary.          Until we receive satisfactory proof of death and instructions, in the proper form, from your beneficiaries,your Policy will remain allocated to the Subaccounts you chose, so the amount of the death benefit will reflect theinvestment performance of those Subaccounts during this period. If your Policy has multiple beneficiaries, deathbenefit proceeds will be calculated once we receive satisfactory proof of death and when we receive instructions, inproper form, from each beneficiary. The death benefit proceeds still remaining to be paid to other beneficiarieswill continue to fluctuate with the investment performance of the Subaccounts you chose, until each beneficiary hasprovided us instructions in the proper form.          If an Owner of the Policy is a corporation, trust or  A death benefit is payable upon:other non-individual, we treat the primary annuitant as an         ­ Your Policy being in force;Owner for purposes of the death benefit. The \"primary              ­ Receipt of Due Proof of Death of the firstannuitant\" is that individual whose life affects the timing or           Owner to die;the amount of the death benefit payout under the Policy. A         ­ Election of an annuity income option; andchange in the primary annuitant will be treated as the death       ­ Proof that the Owner died before anyof an Owner.                                                             annuity payments begin.                                                                \"Due Proof of Death\" is a certified copy of aIf the annuitant is an Owner or joint Owner, the death certificate, a certified copy of a decree ofannuitant’s death is treated as the Owner’s death.              a court of competent jurisdiction as to the finding          If the annuitant is not an Owner and the annuitant    of death, a written statement by the attendingdies before the Annuity Date, the Owner may name a new          physician, or any other proof satisfactory to us.annuitant if such Owner(s) is not a corporation or other non-individual or if such Owner is the trustee of an InternalRevenue Code Section 401(a) retirement plan. If the Owner does not name a new annuitant, the Owner willbecome the annuitant.          If your spouse is the Policy beneficiary, annuitant, or a joint Owner, special tax rules apply. See the IRSRequired Distribution Upon Owner’s Death section below.We will deduct any applicable premium tax not previously deducted from the death benefit payable.          In most cases, when death benefit proceeds are paid in a lump sum, we will pay the death benefit proceedsby establishing an interest bearing account for the beneficiary, in the amount of the death benefit proceeds payable.The same interest rate schedule and other account terms will apply to all beneficiary accounts in place at any giventime. We will send the beneficiary a checkbook within 7 days after we receive all the required documents, and thebeneficiary will have immediate access to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the amount ofthe death benefit proceeds payable. The account is part of our general account. It is not a bank account and it is notinsured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As part of our general account, it is subject to the claims ofour creditors. We receive a benefit from all amounts left in the general account.DESIGNER ANNUITY                                    - 20 -• Standard Death Benefit          Upon any Owner’s death before the Annuity Date, the Policy will end, and we will pay a death benefit toyour beneficiary. The death benefit equals the larger of:          B your Policy value (without deduction of the withdrawal charge) on the later of the date we receive                Due Proof of Death or an annuity payout option election less any charge for applicable premium                taxes; or          B the sum of net premiums, less partial withdrawals.          Upon any Owner’s death on or after the Annuity Date and before all proceeds have been paid, no deathbenefit is payable, but any remaining proceeds will be paid to the designated annuity benefit payee based on theannuity income option in effect at the time of death.• IRS Required Distribution Upon Death of Owner          Federal law requires that if your Policy is tax non-qualified and you die before the Annuity Date, then theentire value of your Policy must be distributed within 5 years of your death. The 5-year rule does not apply to thatportion of the proceeds which (a) is for the benefit of an individual beneficiary; and (b) will be paid over the lifetimeor the life expectancy of that beneficiary as long as payments begin not later than one year after the date of yourdeath. Special rules may apply to your surviving spouse. The Statement of Additional Information has a moredetailed description of these rules. Other required distribution rules apply to tax-qualified Policies and are describedin this prospectus' APPENDIX B.• Table Illustrating Benefits Upon Death          The following tables illustrate benefits payable, if any, upon death of a party to the Policy for most, but notnecessarily all, situations.

Yourelection must be made when the Policy is issued, and only if you and the Annuitant are then not older than age 70.Your election cannot be changed or revoked. Each feature ends at your age 85. Under these features, if the Owneris not a natural person, you cannot change the annuitant after the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature iselected. Each of the options provides the opportunity to enhance the Policy’s death benefit if Subaccount underlyingportfolios should sharply decrease in value. See this prospectus’ CHARGES and CHARGES EXPLAINEDsections for information on the charge for these optional features.           Optional \"Periodic Step-Up\" Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit          At Policy issue, the guaranteed minimum death benefit amount is the amount of the initial premium.Thereafter, the guaranteed minimum death benefit amount for a given Policy Year is equal to the greater of:                (a) the Policy value at the time Due Proof of Death is received,                (b) the sum of premiums paid less withdrawals, or                (c) the guaranteed minimum death benefit on the Policy Anniversary when the most recent death                    benefit \"step-up occurred.The \"step-up\" interval is stated in your Policy’s schedule page for this feature.

You will receive the annuity benefits unless youdesignate another payee(s). The level of annuity payments ­ may be subject to a withdrawal charge.is determined by your Policy value, the annuitant's sex ­ may be taxable and, if premature,                                                           subject to a tax penalty.(except where prohibited by law) and age, and the annuityincome option selected. All or part of your Policy CashSurrender Value may be placed under one or more annuity income option.          Annuity payments may be subject to a withdrawal charge. A withdrawal charge is not applied on theAnnuity Date for premiums applied after the second year since receipt to the Life or Joint and Last Survivor annuityincome options. However, the withdrawal charge does apply to Policy value placed under other annuity incomeoptions.          Annuity payments must be made to individuals receiving payments on their own behalf, unless otherwiseagreed to by us. Any annuity income option is only effective once we acknowledge it. We may require initial andongoing proof of the Owner's or annuitant's age or survival. Unless you specify otherwise, the payee is the Owner.          Payments under the annuity income options are fixed annuity payments based on a fixed rate of interest ator higher than the minimum effective annual rate which is guaranteed to yield 3% on an annual basis. We have solediscretion whether or not to pay a higher interest rate for annuity income options 1, 2, or 3 (see below). Currentimmediate annuity rates for options 4 or 5 for the same class of annuities are used if higher than the guaranteedamounts (guaranteed amounts are based upon the tables contained in the Policy). The guaranteed amounts are basedDESIGNER ANNUITY        - 22 -on the 1983 Table \"a\" Individual Annuity Table projected 17 years, and an interest rate which is guaranteed to yield3% on an annual basis. Current interest rates, and further information, may be obtained from us. The amount ofeach fixed annuity payment is set and begins on the Annuity Date, and does not change.! When Annuity Income Payments Begin          You select the Annuity Date by completing an election form that you can request from us at any time. Thisdate may not be any earlier than the fifth Policy anniversary. If you do not specify a date, the Annuity Date will bethe later of the Policy Anniversary nearest the annuitant's 85th birthday or the fifth Policy Anniversary. Tax-qualified Policies may require an earlier Annuity Date. You may change this date by sending Written Notice for ourreceipt at least 30 days before the then current Annuity Date.! Selecting an Annuity Income Option                                           The longer the guaranteed or          You choose the annuity income option by completing an election       projected annuity income option                                                                               period, the lower the amount ofform that you can request from us at any time. You may change your             each annuity payment.selection during your life by sending Written Notice for our receipt at least30 days before the date annuity payments are scheduled to begin. If noselection is made by then, we will apply the Policy Cash Surrender Valueto make annuity payments under annuity income option 4 providinglifetime income payments.          If you die before the Annuity Date (and the Policy is in force), your beneficiary may elect to receive thedeath benefit under one of the annuity income options (unless applicable law or a settlement agreement dictateotherwise).! Annuity Income Options          Once fixed annuity payments under an annuity income option begin, they cannot be changed. (We mayallow the beneficiary to transfer amounts applied under options 1, 2 or 3 to option 4, 5 or 6 after the Annuity Date.However, we reserve the right to discontinue this practice.) When the Owner dies, we will pay any unpaidguaranteed payments to your beneficiary. Upon the last payee's death, we will pay any unpaid guaranteed paymentsto that payee's estate.          Note: Unless you elect an annuity income option with a guaranteed period or option 1, it is possible thatonly one annuity payment would be made under the annuity option if the annuitant dies before the due date of thesecond annuity payment, only two annuity payments would be made if the annuitant died before the due date of thethird annuity payment, etc.          Part or all of any annuity payment may be taxable as ordinary income. If, at the time annuity paymentsbegin, you have not given us Written Notice to not withhold federal income taxes, we must by law withhold suchtaxes from the taxable portion of each annuity payment and remit it to the Internal Revenue Service. (Withholdingis mandatory for certain tax-qualified Policies.)          We may pay your Policy proceeds to you in one sum if they are less than $1,000, or when the annuityincome option chosen would result in periodic payments of less than $20. If any annuity payment would be orbecomes less than $20, we also have the right to change the frequency of payments to an interval that will result inpayments of at least $20. In no event will we make payments under an annuity option less frequently than annually.          The annuity income options are:                         (4) Lifetime Income Annuity. Proceeds are paid(1) Interest Payment.

It is NOT intended as tax  advice. All information is subject to change without notice. We make no attempt to review any state or local laws,  or to address estate or inheritance laws or other tax consequences of annuity ownership or receipt of distributions.  You should consult a competent tax adviser to learn how tax laws apply to your annuity interests.             Section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\") governs taxation of annuities  in general and Code Section 817 provides rules regarding the tax treatment of variable annuities. Other Code  sections may also impact taxation of your variable annuity investment and/or earnings.   Tax Deferrals During Accumulation Period             An important feature of variable annuities is tax-deferred treatment of earnings during the accumulation  phase. An individual Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of a Policy until a withdrawal occurs, either in  the form of a non-periodic payment or as annuity payments under the settlement option selected.  ■ Taxation of Withdrawals             Withdrawals are included in gross income to the extent of any allocable income. Any amount in excess of  the investment in the Policy is allocable to income. Accordingly, withdrawals are treated as coming first from the  earnings, then, only after the income portion is exhausted, as coming from principal.          If you make a withdrawal, not only is the income portion of such a distribution subject to federal incometaxation, but a 10% penalty may apply. However, the penalty does not apply to distributions:              after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2;              upon the death of the Owner;              if the taxpayer is defined as totally disabled;              as periodic withdrawals that are a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least                   annually for the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or for the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)                   of the taxpayer and the beneficiary;              under an immediate annuity; or              under certain other limited circumstances.  ■ Taxation of Annuity Payments             Earnings from a variable annuity are taxable only upon withdrawal and are treated as ordinary income.  Generally, the Code provides for the return of your investment in an annuity policy in equal tax-free amounts over  the annuity payout period. Fixed annuity payment amounts may be excluded from taxable income based on the ratio  of the investment in the Policy to the total expected value of annuity payments. If you elect variable annuity  payments, the amount excluded from taxable income is determined by dividing the investment in the Policy by the  total number of expected payments. The balance of each payment is taxable income. After you recover your  investment in the Policy, any payment you receive is fully taxable. (If a variable payment is less than the excludable  amount you should contact your tax adviser to determine how to report any investment not recovered.) The taxable  portion of any annuity payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.  ■ Taxation of Death Proceeds             A death benefit paid under the Policy may be taxable income to the beneficiary. The rules on taxation of an  annuity apply. Estate taxes may also apply to your estate, even if all or a portion of the benefit is subject to federal  income taxes. To be treated as an annuity, a Policy must provide that: (1) if an annuitant dies: (a) on or after the  annuity starting date, and (b) before the entire interest in the Policy is distributed, the balance will be distributed at  least as rapidly as under the method being used at the date of death, and (2) if the annuitant dies before the annuity  starting date, the entire interest must be distributed within five years of death. If distributed in a lump sum, the death  benefit amount is taxed in the same manner as a full withdrawal. If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the  owner, it is possible to continue deferring taxes on the accrued and future income of the Policy until payments are  made to the surviving spouse.DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 24 -■ Tax Treatment of Assignments and Transfers          An assignment or pledge of an annuity Policy is treated as a withdrawal. Also, the Code (particularly fortax-qualified plans) and ERISA in some circumstances prohibit such transactions, subjecting them to income taxpenalties and additional excise tax. Therefore, you should consult a competent tax adviser if you wish to assign orpledge your Policy.■ Tax Treatments by Type of Owner          A Policy held by an entity other than a natural person, such as a corporation, estate or trust, usually is nottreated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes. The income on such a Policy is taxable in the year received oraccrued by the owner. However, this rule does not apply if the owner is acting as an agent for an individual or is anestate that acquired the Policy as a result of the death of the decedent. Nor does it apply if the Policy is held bycertain qualified plans, is held pursuant to a qualified funding trust (structured settlement plan), or if an employerpurchased the Policy under a terminated qualified plan. You should consult your tax adviser before purchasing aPolicy to be owned by a non-natural person.■ Annuity Used to Fund Qualified Plan          The Policy is designed for use with various qualified plans including.           Tax Sheltered Annuities, Code Section 403(b);           Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs), Code Section 408(b);           Simplified Employee Pension (SEP IRA), Code Section 408(k);           Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE IRA), Code Section 408(p); and           Roth IRAs, Code Section 408A.          The Policy will not provide additional tax deferral benefits if it is used to fund a tax-deferred qualified plan.However, Policy features and benefits other than tax deferral may make it an appropriate investment for a qualifiedplan. You should review the annuity features, including all benefits and expenses, prior to purchasing a variableannuity. Tax rules for qualified plans are very complex and vary according to the type and terms of the plan, as wellas individual facts and circumstances. Each purchaser should obtain competent tax advice prior to purchasinga Policy issued under a qualified plan.          The Company reserves the right to limit the availability of the Policy for use with any of the plans listedabove or to modify the Policy to conform to tax requirements. Some retirement plans are subject to requirementsthat we have not incorporated into our administrative procedures. Unless we specifically consent, we are not boundby plan requirements to the extent that they conflict with the terms of the Policy.          On July 26, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") published new regulations for tax sheltered annuitycontracts under Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b). While most of these provisions became effective January 1,2009, the new regulations on tax-free exchanges of contracts became effective September 24, 2007. The new 403(b)regulations allow for the exchange of annuity contracts if the plan sponsor (employer) and the contract provider(insurance company) agree to share certain information. This contrasts with prior rules, when a contract Owner(employee) and the insurer(s) could complete an exchange without directly involving the plan sponsor.          Therefore, Ameritas is suspending 403(b) exchanges (both incoming and outgoing) and 403(b) trustee-to-trustee transfers until we have an information sharing agreement with the 403(b) plan sponsors that is consistentwith the new regulations. We will follow the IRS Regulations to help assure that the steps we and your plansponsors take will maintain the tax-deferred nature of your 403(b) contract. If you must discontinue your 403(b)annuity while exchanges are suspended, you may submit paperwork to initiate a withdrawal or a rollover to an IRAor to another qualified plan, if a distributable event has occurred (such as attainment of age 59½, severance fromemployment, death, disability, or qualified reservist distribution and circumstances allow). Our Service Center isavailable to assist you with any of your contract needs.■ Tax Impact on Account Value          Certain Policy credits are treated as taxable \"earnings\" and not \"investments\" for tax purposes. Taxableearnings are considered paid out first, followed by the return of your premiums (investment amounts).DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 25 -MISCELLANEOUS ABOUT OUR COMPANY          Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. issues the Policy described in this prospectus and is responsible forproviding each Policy's insurance and annuity benefits. Prior to May 1, 2007, AVLIC issued the Policy. EffectiveMay 1, 2007, AVLIC merged with and into Ameritas (\"Merger\"). AVLIC was a wholly-owned subsidiary ofAmeritas. On the date of the Merger, Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. acquired from AVLIC all of AVLIC’s assets,and became directly liable for AVLIC’s liabilities and obligations with respect to all policies issued by AVLIC thenoutstanding.          The Merger was approved by the boards of directors of Ameritas and AVLIC. The Merger also receivedregulatory approval from the State of Nebraska Department of Insurance, the state of domicile of Ameritas andAVLIC. The Merger did not affect the terms of, or the rights and obligations under your Policy, other than to reflectthe change to the company that guarantees your Policy benefits from AVLIC to Ameritas. You will receive a Policyendorsement from Ameritas that reflects the change from AVLIC to Ameritas. The Merger also did not result in anyadverse tax consequences for any Policy owners.          On April 1, 2002 AVLIC entered into an Assumption Reinsurance Agreement with our affiliate AcaciaNational Life Insurance Company (\"Acacia National\"), which included the Designer Annuity Policies issued byAcacia National. Under the Assumption Reinsurance Agreement, upon receipt of required approval AVLICassumed all obligations under the Policies. Your rights and benefits under the Policy with AVLIC, and now withAmeritas, remain identical to the rights and benefits you had with Acacia National.          Ameritas is a stock life insurance company organized under the insurance laws of the State of Nebraska, inbusiness since 1887. We are an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of UNIFI Mutual Holding Company. Our homeaddress is 5900 \"O\" Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68510. (See the TABLE OF CONTENTS page of this prospectus, orthe cover page or last page for information on how to contact us.)          We are engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuities, group dental and eye and hearinginsurance, retirement plans and 401(k) plans throughout the United States (except New York). The UNIFIcompanies are a diversified family of financial services businesses offering the above-listed products and services aswell as mutual funds and other investments, financial planning, banking, and public financing.          Ameritas relies on the exemption provided by Rule 12h-7 to file reports under the Securities Exchange Actof 1934. DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICIES          Ameritas Investment Corp. (\"AIC\"), 5900 \"O\" Street, Lincoln, Nebraska 68510, a direct majority ownedsubsidiary of ours, is the principal underwriter of the Policies. AIC enters into contracts with various broker-dealers(\"Distributors\") to distribute Policies. All persons selling the Policy will be registered representatives of theDistributors, and will also be licensed as insurance agents to sell variable insurance products. AIC is registered withthe Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer and is a member of the Financial Industry RegulatoryAuthority (\"FINRA\"). Commissions paid to all distributors may be up to a total of 7% of premiums. We may alsopay other distribution expenses such as production incentive bonuses. The list of broker-dealers to whom we payconference sponsorship fees (typically ranging from $5,000 to $25,000) and marketing support allowances maychange from time to time. In calendar year 2009, we paid no conference sponsorship fees. We paid marketingsupport allowances to certain agencies affiliated with Centralife Annuities Service, Inc., the minority owner (20%)of AIC. These distribution expenses do not result in any additional charges under the Policy other than thosedescribed in this prospectus' CHARGES and CHARGES EXPLAINED sections. VOTING RIGHTS          As required by law, we will vote the Subaccount shares in the underlying portfolios at regular and specialshareholder meetings of the series funds pursuant to instructions received from persons having voting interests in theunderlying portfolios. The underlying portfolios may not hold routine annual shareholder meetings. If you send uswritten voting instructions, we will follow your instructions in voting the Portfolio shares attributable to your Policy.If you do not send us written instructions, we will vote the shares attributable to your Policy in the same proportionsas we vote the shares for which we have received instructions from other Policy Owners. It is possible that a smallnumber of Policy owners can determine the outcome of a voting proposal. We will vote shares that we hold in thesame proportions as we vote the shares for which we have received instructions from other Policy Owners. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS          As of the date of this Prospectus, there are no proceedings affecting the Separate Account, or that arematerial in relation to our total assets.DESIGNER ANNUITY  - 26 -APPENDIX A: Accumulation Unit Values          The following table shows Accumulation Unit values (\"AUVs\") for the Subaccounts that fund obligationsof Ameritas Variable Separate Account VA (the \"Registrant\") under variable annuity Policies offered by thisprospectus. Designer Annuity AUVs are shown as of the close of business each December 31, which marks thebeginning and end of each fiscal period. The table also provides the number of Accumulation Units outstanding foreach Subaccount variable investment option portfolio as of the end of the periods indicated for the DesignerAnnuity, as well as accumulation units for the Registrant's Allocator 2000 Annuity policies, which are also nolonger offered for sale, but for which the Registrant may continue to accept payments. Policy expenses vary foreach of the Registrant's variable annuities; therefore, Designer Annuity AUVs are not representative of values forthe Allocator 2000 Annuity.

Under the Plan, the merger will involve the transfer of all of the assets of the Merging Fund to the Surviving Fund in exchange for Surviving Fund shares having an aggregate net asset value equal to the value of the Merging Fund's net assets, the Surviving Fund's assumption of all the liabilities of the Merging Fund, the distribution of Surviving Fund shares to the shareholders of the Merging Fund and the dissolution of the Merging Fund. As such, on the closing date of the merger, Merging Fund shareholders will become shareholders of the Surviving Fund and receive shares of the Surviving Fund with a total net asset value equal to that of their shares of the Merging Fund on the closing date. The merger is designed to be tax-free to shareholders. The merger is expected to take place on or about November 6, As a result of the merger, November 4, 2015, will be the last day the Merging Fund will accept purchases of shares or exchanges into the Merging Fund. Until that date, you will be able to purchase and exchange shares in the Merging Fund indirectly through the subaccount corresponding to the Merging Fund (the "Merging Fund Subaccount"). Effective November 5, 2015, the Surviving Fund will be added as a variable investment option to your variable annuity Contract or variable life insurance Policy. Unless you inform us otherwise, effective November 5, 2015, any instruction to purchase or exchange shares to the Merging Fund Subaccount will be deemed to be an instruction for the Surviving Fund Subaccount. Effective November 6, 2015, all such instructions that designate the Merging Fund will be deemed to be an instruction for the Surviving Fund Subaccount. This includes, but is not limited to, instructions for purchase payments, partial withdrawals, and transfer instructions (including instructions under any automatic or systematic transfer option). If your Contract or Policy remains allocated to the Merging Fund Subaccount at the time the merger occurs, those units will be replaced by units corresponding to the Surviving Fund Subaccount, and thereafter the value of your Contract or Policy will depend on the performance of the Surviving Fund. The number of Surviving Fund Subaccount units you receive as a result of the merger will depend on the value of your Merging Fund Subaccount units at the time the merger occurs. Effective November 5, 2015, your prospectus is revised by adding the following: FUND NAME INVESTMENT ADVISER Portfolio Name Subadviser(s) Portfolio Type / Summary of Investment Objective Neuberger Berman Advisers Management Trust Neuberger Berman Management LLC Neuberger Berman AMT Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Seeks growth of capital.

The Legal Proceedings section in your prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We and our subsidiaries, like other life insurance companies, are subject to regulatory and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of the proceedings we are involved in assert claims for substantial amounts. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of any pending or future case, legal proceeding or regulatory action, we do not expect the ultimate result of any of these actions to result in a material adverse effect on the Separate Account, our ability to meet our obligations under the Policies, or AIC's ability to perform its obligations. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on any or all of the above.

Subadvisers: (1) Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. and (2) other investment advisers serve as sub-advisers for the fund. IN /1312 Portfolio Substitution 3. We have filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") seeking an order approving the substitution of shares of the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial Class for shares of the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio. The effect of the substitution would permit us to replace the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio ("Existing Fund") with the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio ("Replacement Fund") as an investment option under the Policies. The Existing Fund and Replacement Fund are described in their respective summary prospectuses, which are available at no charge by contacting Customer Service at , or by logging into your account on the internet service center at Ameritas.com. Until the date of the substitution, Policy value currently allocated to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio may remain invested in the corresponding Subaccount, and transfers of Policy value into and out of that Subaccount will be allowed. Any allocation to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio pursuant to an asset allocation model will continue according to the model until the date of any substitution unless we receive different allocation instructions from you. We anticipate the substitution will occur on or around November 15, From the date of this supplement to the date of the substitution, if you have allocations to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio Subaccount, you may transfer such allocations to any other available Subaccount without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. If carried out, the proposed substitution would result in any Policy value you have allocated to the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund being, in effect, transferred at relative net asset value to a Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund. We will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution. There would be no tax consequences resulting from this exchange. After the substitution, the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will no longer be available for investment under the Policy. Once the substitution occurs, unless you instruct us otherwise, any existing or future instruction that designates the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will be deemed to be an instruction for the Subaccount funded by the Replacement Fund. This includes, but is not limited to, instructions for purchase payments, partial withdrawals, and transfer instructions (including instructions under any automatic or systematic transfer option). All references in your prospectus to the Existing Fund will be replaced with a reference to the Replacement Fund. From the date of the substitution, until at least thirty (30) days after the substitution, you are permitted to transfer Policy value out of the Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund to one or more other Subaccounts or the fixed account (if available) within the Policy without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer being treated as one of a limited number of free transfers allowed under your Policy. If you would like to make a transfer of Policy value, please contact Customer Service at , or log into your account on the internet service center at Ameritas.com. Information about the Replacement Fund, its investment policy, risks, fees and expenses and other aspects of its operations, can be found in its prospectus, which you should read carefully. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY NEW FUND WILL ACHIEVE ITS STATED OBJECTIVE. If you have any questions about this proposed substitution, please contact a Customer Service representative at All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus, as previously supplemented.

Approval by the IRS is to form only and does not represent a determination of the merits of the Regular IRA or Roth IRA.Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.  -B:4-                                                    Tax Qualified Plan DisclosureDISCLOSURE SUMMARY                    For annuity policies issued as a:                                             TAX SHELTERED ANNUITYAMERITAS LIFE INSURANCE CORP.                Under IRC Section 403(b)The Policy may be purchased by your employer as part of a retirement plan under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 403(b). Thissection provides a summary of benefits afforded a tax-qualified retirement plan under IRC 403(b), and the prospectus' CHARGES andCHARGES EXPLAINED sections describe applicable costs. You should refer to the Policy and Riders for a full description of thebenefits and charges of purchasing the Policy for an IRC 403(b) plan.NOTICE REGARDING EXCHANGESOn July 26, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") published new regulations for tax sheltered annuity contracts under InternalRevenue Code Section 403(b). Please see the FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS section of this prospectus for more information.CONTRIBUTIONSContributions under the Policy must be remitted by the employer. You may, if permitted by the applicable 403(b) plan documents andwith our agreement, (i) transfer to the Policy any amount held under a contract or account that meets the requirements of IRC Section403(b) (\"Transferred Funds\"), or (ii) roll over contributions from a contract or account that meets the requirements of IRC Sections403(b) or 408(d)(3)(A)(iii). If you make a transfer as described in (i) above, you must tell us the portion, if any, of the Transferred Fundswhich are (a) exempt from the payment restrictions described below and (b) eligible for delayed distribution under the RequiredMinimum Distribution provision below. If you do not tell us, then we will treat all such amounts as being subject to the applicable taxrestrictions. Any Transferred Funds from a contract not issued by us will be reduced by the amount of any tax charge that applies, as wedetermine.Contributions to the Policy are limited to your exclusion allowance for the year computed as required by IRC Sections 403(b), 415, and402(g), which is $16,500 for 2010. Unless this Policy is purchased under an ERISA Plan and \"employer contributions\" may be made, allcontributions are made by your employer under a salary reduction agreement you enter into with your employer. Your salary reductioncontributions are \"elective deferrals\" and cannot exceed the elective deferral limitations under IRC Section 402(g) which apply to thisPolicy and all other 403(b), 401(k), or SIMPLE plans, contracts or arrangements with your employer. If contributions to the Policyinadvertently cause the excess deferral limit to be violated, such deferrals must be distributed by April 15 of the following calendar year,subject to any Policy withdrawal charge that may be applicable.In the case of an individual who is 50 or older, the annual cash contribution limit is increased by $5,500 for 2009. This amount may beincreased for inflation in future years.Notwithstanding any provision of the Policy to the contrary, contributions will be permitted with respect to qualified military service inaccordance with the requirements of IRC Section 414(u), if applicable, and limited to limits imposed by IRC Section 403(b).We reserve the right to reject or refund any contributions when we believe doing so is necessary for the Policy to comply with IRCSection 403(b) or the Plan.LOANSFor 403(b) TSA Policies issued after January 1, 2002, we may charge a reasonable fee (currently $25; guaranteed maximum is $40) foreach loan as loan origination expenses; however, this fee will be waived if loan repayment is established on an automatic basis.Other loan provisions are described in this Prospectus' DISTRIBUTION section Loans provision.DISTRIBUTIONSWhen Annuity Income Payments BeginYour selection of an Annuity Date for annuity income payments to begin is subject to the maximum maturity age, if any, stated in thePolicy Data pages. If you choose an Annuity Date later than age 70½, you must withdraw at least the required minimum distributionrequired by tax regulations that apply, unless you elect to satisfy these requirements through other 403(b) arrangements you may have.Permitted DistributionsDistributions of Policy value in the case of salary reduction contributions will only be permitted:             upon the Owner's severance of employment;             after the Owner's age 59½;             due to disability within the meaning of IRC Section 72(m)(7);             due to financial hardship;             qualified reservist distribution.Distributions may be further restricted if we are notified of more restrictive Plan limits. Withdrawal charges may apply to distributions.Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.  -B:5-  Tax Qualified Plan DisclosureDespite the distribution restrictions stated above, we will permit distributions of salary deferrals in excess of IRC limits contributed tothe Policy, and any allocable gain or loss, including that for the \"gap period\" between the end of the taxable year and distribution date,provided you notify us in writing by March 1 of the year following the taxable year of the excess deferral and certify the amount of theexcess deferral.Distributions attributable to contributions transferred from a custodial account qualified under IRC Section 403(b)(7) or from an annuityunder IRC Section 403(b)(1) shall be subject to the same or, where there has been more than one transfer, more stringent distributionrequirements as they were subject to prior to the transfer, unless otherwise permitted by law or regulation.Trustee-to-trustee transfers to another 403(b) qualified plan are not considered a distribution and are not restricted. However, theapplicable plans document must both permit the transfer.If the Owner's employer has established an ERISA plan under IRC Section 403(b), any distributions under this Policy will be restricted,as provided in IRC Sections 401(a)(11) and 417.Direct Rollover OptionA distributee under the Policy, or the distributee's surviving spouse, or the spouse of the distributee's former spouse who is an alternatepayee under a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in IRC Section 414(p)) (collectively, the \"distributee\" for purposes of thisparagraph), may elect to have any portion of an eligible distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by thedistributee as a direct rollover. (For purposes of a direct rollover, an eligible retirement plan includes 403(b) annuity policies, qualifiedretirement plans under 401(a), 401(k) plans, IRAs and 457 governmental plans.) The direct rollover option is not available to the extentthat a minimum distribution is required under IRC Section 401(a)(9). The direct rollover option also does not apply to Policydistributions permitted and made on account of a hardship. We reserve the right to determine the amount of the required minimumdistribution.If Policy annuity payments have already begun, a direct rollover option does not apply to those payments being paid: (a) in substantiallyequal periodic payments for a period of ten years or more; or, (b) as part of a life annuity.Required Minimum DistributionsDistributions under the Policy made on or after January 1, 2003 will be subject to Required Minimum Distribution requirements of IRCSection 401(a)(9) pursuant to final and temporary regulations issued by the IRS in 2002.Required Minimum Distribution payments for this Policy must be computed for the calendar year you turn age 70½ and for each yearthereafter. The Required Minimum Distribution payments you compute must start no later than April 1 of the calendar year after youturn age 70½, except as otherwise noted below, and except that if your employer is a church or government organization, the start date isthe later of this date or April 1 of the calendar year after you retire.Payments of your annual Required Minimum Distribution calculated for this Policy may be made from this Policy or from another403(b) arrangement that you maintain, if permitted by Internal Revenue Service rules. These payments may be made under any methodpermitted for 403(b) Plans and acceptable to us; several of your Policy's annuity income options fulfill the IRC requirements.If you die after Required Minimum Distribution payments have begun, the remaining amount of your Policy value must continue to bepaid at least as quickly as under the calculation and payment method being used before your death.If you die before Required Minimum Distribution payments begin, payment of your Policy value must be completed no later thanDecember 31 of the calendar year in which the fifth anniversary of your death occurs, except to the extent that a choice is made toreceive death benefit payments under (a) and (b) below:            (a) If payments are to be made to a beneficiary, then the Policy value may be paid over the life or life expectancy of the                   named beneficiary. Such payments must begin on or before December 31 of the calendar year which follows the year of                   your death.            (b) If the named beneficiary is your spouse, the date that payments must begin under (a) above will not be before (i)                   December 31 of the calendar year which follows the year of your death or, if later, (ii) December 31 of the calendar year                   in which you would have reached age 70½.CONVERSION OF A 403(b) POLICY TO A NON-403(b) QUALIFIED POLICY            The IRC only permits you to maintain a 403(b) Policy while you are covered under a 403(b) Plan. Upon no longer beingcovered under a 403(b) plan, you may \"roll over\" some or all of your 403(b) Policy assets into another tax-qualified annuity policy,including an Individual Retirement Annuity policy. Should you need to exercise such a rollover, you may elect to convert your existing403(b) Policy with us into an IRA Policy. Because certain distributions are permitted under IRC Section 403(b) that are not permittedfor IRAs, any conversion may result in a loss of certain benefits (such as 403(b) permitted hardship withdrawals). Upon such aconversion, your 403(b) Tax Sheltered Annuity Endorsement (and related charges) will be replaced with an Individual RetirementAnnuity Endorsement (and any related charges) to assure continued compliance of your Policy with applicable tax law. You will receivefull disclosure about the effect of any such conversion prior to making your election.Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.  -B:6-  Tax Qualified Plan Disclosure STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL                                                                    INFORMATION TABLE OF                                                                    CONTENTS                       THANK YOU                                    A Statement of Additional Informationfor reviewing this Prospectus.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Life Insurance Companies, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective separate accounts, propose to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolio for shares of the Current Portfolio held by the Accounts to fund the Contracts.
2. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life Accounts. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life of NY Accounts. The Union Central Life Insurance Company is the depositor and sponsor of the Carillon Life Account.
3. Each Account is a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act, and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust. Security interests under the Contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). The application sets forth the registration statement file numbers for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts.
4. Each Account is divided into subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding investment portfolio (a “Portfolio”) of a series-type management investment company, including CVSI.
5. Pursuant to the Contracts, the Life Insurance Companies reserve the right to substitute shares of one Portfolio for shares of another. The prospectuses for the Contracts also disclose that the Life Insurance Companies reserve this right.
6. CVSI is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-03591) that currently consists of six investment portfolios, including the Current Portfolio, and issues a separate series of shares in connection with each. CVSI has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 002-80154).
7. Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (“CIM”) serves as the investment adviser to each CVSI Portfolio. CIM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AMHC.
8. The VIPFV is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-05361) that currently consists of 32 investment portfolios, one of which, the Replacement Portfolio, is the subject of the proposed Substitution. VIPFV issues a separate series of shares in connection with each Portfolio and has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 033-17704).
9. Fidelity Management & Research Company (“FMR”) serves as the manager of each Portfolio of VIPFV. FMR receives an investment management fee from each Portfolio. Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (“FIMM”) and other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio. FIMM has the day-to-day responsibility of choosing investments for the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio and may provide investment research and advice for the Replacement Portfolio. None of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM, or other affiliates of FMR are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated person) of any of the Applicants. Likewise, none of the Applicants are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated persons) of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM or other affiliates of FMR.
10. The Applicants state that Replacement Portfolio's and Current Portfolio's respective investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same. A comparison of the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Replacement Portfolio and the Current Portfolio is included in the application.
11. The following table compares the fees and expenses of the Current Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio as of the year ended December 31, 2012:
 Current portfolioReplacement portfolioCalvert Variable Series, Inc., Calvert VP Money Market PortfolioVariable Insurance Products Fund V, VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial ClassManagement Fee0.25%0.17%.Distribution and Service (12b-1) FeeNoneNone.Other Expenses0.14%0.09%.Total Operating Expenses0.39%0.26%.Fee Waivers and Expense ReimbursementsNone 1None.Net Operating Expenses0.39% 20.26%.1 The Investment Advisor, CIM, has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through April 30, 2014 to 0.40%. Under the terms of the contractual expense limitation, operating expenses do not include interest expense, brokerage commissions, taxes and extraordinary expenses. Only the Board of Directors of CVSI may terminate a Portfolio's expense cap before the contractual period expires.2 The Advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of $88,900 or 0.11%, for Net Operating Expenses of 0.28% to maintain a positive yield during the year ended December 31, 2012.
12. The Applicants state that the proposed Substitution is in response to a decision by the Board of Directors for CVSI, at a meeting held on June 5, 2013, to approve the dissolution of the Current Portfolio on or about November 15, 2013 (the “Liquidation Date”). The board's decision to liquidate the Current Portfolio requires the Life Insurance Companies to transfer accumulated Contract value invested in the Current Portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the Contracts on or before the Liquidation Date. Currently, the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the Contracts is the Current Portfolio. Accordingly, the proposed Substitution is necessary in order to provide the Contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option. Consequently, the Life Insurance Companies have determined to replace the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio via the Substitution.
13. The Life Insurance Companies submit that the Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate alternative for Contract owners for several reasons. First, its investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the Current Portfolio. Second, it is substantially larger than the Current Portfolio, has had lower overall expense levels than the Portfolio in recent years, and has had higher yields in recent years than the Current Portfolio. Third, the Contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the Life Insurance Companies currently offer one or more VIPFV portfolios (other than the Replacement Portfolio).
14. The Applicants believe that Contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the Replacement Portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the Replacement Portfolio, as contrasted Start Printed Page 65395with the size and recent yields of the Current Portfolio. The yield for the Current Portfolio for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.01%. The net asset value of the Current Portfolio was $85,913,000 as of December 31, 2012. The yield for the Replacement Portfolio Initial Class shares for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.08%. The net asset value of the Replacement Portfolio supporting Initial Class shares was $889,797,000 as of December 31, 2012.
15. The Applicants believe that Contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the Replacement Portfolio as compared to the Current Portfolio. Specifically, the management fee, other expenses, and total operating expenses are less than those of the Current Portfolio. Both Portfolios have no charge for Rule 12b-1 distribution and services fees. The total annual operating expense of the Replacement Portfolio is less than that of the Current Portfolio. Given this decrease, the Applicants believe that the Substitution would benefit Contract owners by reducing the overall level of Portfolio expenses.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitution. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust.
2. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution is not the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Section 26(c) was intended to provide for Commission scrutiny of a proposed Substitution which could, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both, as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption. Consequently, the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holder's only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security, or to elect a costly and, in effect, forced redemption.
3. Applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide Contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include Section 26(c).
4. Applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. All redemptions of shares of the Current Portfolio and purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolio will be effected in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The Substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the Substitution (“Effective Date”) with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable Account.
5. Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge. Contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the Life Insurance Companies' respective obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way and the Substitution will not change Contract owners' insurance benefits under the Contracts. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitution, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by the Life Insurance Companies. In addition, the Substitution will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners.
6. The Applicants also represent that the Substitution will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Life Insurance Companies will not exercise any right they may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the Contracts for the period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date.
7. Existing Contract owners will be notified of the proposed Substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the Contracts (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Date. New purchasers of the Contracts will be provided the Pre-Substitution Notice, the Contract prospectus, and the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
8. The Pre-Substitution Notice will: (i) State that the Applicants filed the application seeking approval of the Substitution; (ii) set forth the anticipated Effective Date; (iii) explain that the Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio would be attributable to the Replacement Portfolio as of the Effective Date; (iv) state that, from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice until the Effective Date, Contract Owners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Current Portfolio sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contract; (v) advise Contract owners that any contract value remaining in the Current Portfolio sub-account on the Effective Date will be transferred to a sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio, and that the Substitution will take place at relative net asset value; (vi) inform Contract owners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the applicable Life Insurance Company will permit Contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio to any other available sub-accounts offered under their Contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees, if any, that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contracts; and (vii) inform Contract owners that, except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus, the applicable Life Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio for at least thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.
9. All Contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitution. In addition, within five (5) days following the Substitution, Contract owners affected by the Substitution will be notified in writing that the Substitution was carried out. This notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice, and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio were transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge Start Printed Page 65396(including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge.
10. The Applicants represent that the Life Insurance Companies will not receive, for three (3) years after the Effective Date, any direct or indirect benefits from the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), in connection with assets attributable to the Contracts affected by the Substitution, at a higher rate than the Life Insurance Companies had received from the Current Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), including without limitation 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements. The Applicants further represent that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a Life Insurance Company or its affiliates by the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter, or their affiliates.
11. Applicants submit that the replacement of the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio is consistent with the protection of Contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and, thus, meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to Substitutions that have been approved in the past.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application, the Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and should therefore be granted.
