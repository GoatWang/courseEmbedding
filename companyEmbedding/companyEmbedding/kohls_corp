The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

Stock market finishes little changed as investors await earnings deluge

Apparel retailer shares rise after analyst comment on improved traffic
Apparel retailer shares rose in Monday trading led by companies like Guess Inc.  (up 5.1%), Macy's Inc.  (up 3.7%) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  (up 4.5%) after a Cowen & Company note said traffic at clothing stores has improved. "Large declines in national traffic have overshadowed consistently better traffic trends at apparel stores," Cowen wrote in a Monday note. The second week in July saw traffic decline 9.7% year-over-year, according to national traffic devices, compared with a 5.6% decline last week. But apparel traffic was down just 5.3%. Electronics traffic was down 26.2%. Year-to-date apparel traffic is down 4% versus a 19.7% decline for electronics. Other shares on the rise Monday include Kohl's Corp.  (up 3%), Michael Kors Holdings Ltd.  (up 2.2%), J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (up 2.8%) and Ralph Lauren Corp.  (up 2%). The SPDR S&P Retail ETF is down 8.6% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 9.9% for the period.

The Kohl's Corporation is an American department store retailing chain. The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

The Kohl's Corporation is an American department store retailing chain. The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

KOHL'S CORPORATION Company Profile

   Kohl's wants its prices to be easy on shoppers and tough on competition. The clothing retailer operates about 1,160 department stores in 49 states, with nearly half of stores in the Midwest and West. Competing with discount and mid-level department stores, it sells moderately priced name-brand and private-label apparel, shoes, accessories, and housewares through centrally located cash registers designed to speed checkout and keep staff costs down. Merchandising relationships allow Kohl's to carry top brands (NIKE, Levi's, OshKosh B'Gosh) not always available to discounters; it's able to sell them for lower prices by controlling costs. A typical store spans 88,000 sq. ft., and serves markets with 150,000 to 200,000 people.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.

KOHL'S CORPORATION Revenue and Financial Data

   Kohl's wants its prices to be easy on shoppers and tough on competition. The clothing retailer operates about 1,160 department stores in 49 states, with nearly half of stores in the Midwest and West. Competing with discount and mid-level department stores, it sells moderately priced name-brand and private-label apparel, shoes, accessories, and housewares through centrally located cash registers designed to speed checkout and keep staff costs down. Merchandising relationships allow Kohl's to carry top brands (NIKE, Levi's, OshKosh B'Gosh) not always available to discounters; it's able to sell them for lower prices by controlling costs. A typical store spans 88,000 sq. ft., and serves markets with 150,000 to 200,000 people.

The Kohl's Corporation is an American department store retailing chain. The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

Privacy Policy
(Privacy Policy Legal Notices - Terms & Conditions of Site Use
Updated as of July 1, 2014) 
 
Welcome to www.kohlscareers.com.  By using the web site, its related subdomains and microsites, mobile web site and other tools and applications expressly linked to this Privacy Policy, if any (collectively, the "Site")), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and Kohl's Corporation's (and its affiliates') use of your information as described in this Policy, and you expressly agree to comply with the Terms & Conditions of Site Use ("Terms of Use").
 
SECURITY & PRIVACY 
 
Please take a moment to read our Policy which explains what type of information is collected through the Site, how that information is used, to whom it is disclosed and how it is safeguarded.
 
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT 
 
When you visit the Site, we do not automatically collect personally identifiable or other personal information.  However, depending upon how you use this Site, you may choose to provide us with information about yourself, including personally identifiable information, such as:
 

Your Name;
Address;
Your E-mail Address;
Phone Number;
Social Security Number;
Date of Birth;
Your Education Information;
Your Anticipated Graduation Date;
Degree Information;
Employment History;
Your Area of Interest;
Other Information Relevant to your Prospective Candidacy at Kohl's.


HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION 
 
We use the information you provide to us through this Site for purposes of determining your qualifications for employment and to potentially correspond with you.  
 
INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES 
 
We do not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone except as expressly authorized by you or to companies that provide support services to us for purposes of this Site and for purposes of determining your qualifications for employment. For example, we use Kenexa to host and maintain this Site on behalf of Kohl's.
 
You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Site, the site or the public.
 
In the event that Kohl's and/or its affiliates would merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business entity as well as (or portions through) an asset sale, some or all of the personal information collected about you could be shared, as well as retained by Kohl's.  
 
SITE TRAFFIC INFORMATION 
 
For the purpose of analyzing site traffic and improving this Site, we collect navigational information when you visit the various pages of our Site through a computer or mobile device. This information is largely anonymous because it does not directly identify you, but instead includes data such as, browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Because this type of information does not specifically personally or directly identify you, it is largely anonymous; however, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.  
 
COOKIES 
 
We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data."  Kohl's and Kenexa may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better service.
We collect non-identifiable information through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Site pages use cookies or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Site pages may not work properly.  You should be aware that our Site may not recognize Do Not Track header information from some or all browsers.
We also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies that will be saved on your computer and which allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information provided by the cookie concerning your use of the website (including your IP-address) will be transferred to a Google server in the United States and saved there. Google will use this information to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports about the website activities for the website operator and to provide additional services concerning the website and internet utilization. Google may transfer this information to third parties, if this is a legal requirement or if third parties are commissioned by Google to process the information. Google will in no event connect your IP-address with other Google data. Through your use of this Site, you expressly agree to the processing of your data by Google in the way described above and for the purpose stated above, in addition to all of the other terms set forth in this Policy.
 
WEB BEACONS 
Site pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
 
CHILDREN UNDER 13 
 
The Site, including its mobile applications and tools, if any, is not marketed to, and does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from, children under the age of 13.  
 
LINKS
 
For your convenience, our Site may contain links to outside web sites. Kohl's is not responsible for the web practices of those sites, and we expressly disclaim liability and responsibility for those links. Please view the respective privacy policies and terms of service provided on those sites if you have any questions about their web practices which Kohl's has neither reviewed or endorsed.  
 
CHANGES IN POLICY 
 
As we continue to offer new and different types of content and services, Kohl's may modify our collection and use practices covered by this Policy. Should there be a material change to our information practices, it will be applied only to information collected on a going forward basis, and we will update this privacy policy statement. For this reason, Kohl's encourages you to review this Policy statement each time you visit this Site.

The Kohl's Corporation is an American department store retailing chain. The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]

The Kohl's Corporation is an American department store retailing chain. The first Kohl's store was a corner grocery store opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1927 by Maxwell Kohl.[3][4] The company's first department store opened in September 1962.[5] British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972, and in 1979, the Kohl family left the management of the company. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British-American Tobacco and took it public in 1992. Kohl's is the second-largest department store by retail sales in the United States.

Company overview[edit]
The company is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, operating 1,162 stores in 49 states.[6] Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores as of February 2013[update]—surpassing its biggest competitor, J. C. Penney in May 2012.[7] In 1998, it entered the S&P 500 list, and is also listed in the Fortune 500 (#146 in 2012).[8] The chain was the 20th-largest retailer in the United States in 2013 in terms of revenue.[9] As of 2013, Kohl's was the second largest U.S. department store company by retail sales.[10]
History[edit]
1940s to 1970s[edit]

Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl's Food Stores.[11] In 1962, after building Kohl's Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store, Kohl's Department Store, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl's between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.[12]
In 1972 the British-American Tobacco Company's U.S. retail division, BATUS Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl's Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores and three liquor stores.[13][14] The Kohl family, led by Allen and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. The family left the management in 1979,[15] and Herbert Kohl became a United States Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl's presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983,[16][17] operating under the name Kohl's Food Store, and later Kohl's Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&P put the Kohl's Food Stores up for sale,[18] as part of an effort to reduce debt. In 2003, A&P closed all Kohl's Food Stores locations.[19][20]
1980s to present[edit]
A group of investors led by the senior management, purchased the company consisting of 40 department stores, in 1986.[21] The company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from Chicago-based MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago's suburbs, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and parts of Michigan.[22][23] Kohl's completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.[24][25]
During the 2000s, Kohl's expanded nationwide to have a presence in 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl's expanded into California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008.[26]
To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl's sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion.[27] In 2011, Kohl's replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum.[28]
In 2007, Kohl's began selling a diffusion line from designer Vera Wang called Simply Vera.[29] Since then, it has also sold diffusion lines from other high-end designers including Narciso Rodriguez and Peter Som.[30][31]
Newsweek magazine ranked Kohl's 18th out of 500 overall and first in its industry in its 2009 "Green Rankings",[32] an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. Newsweek remarked that Kohl's had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. In 2008, Kohl's started to sell reusable shopping bags.[33]
In 2012, Kohl's was awarded 62.5 million dollars in tax credits the same year from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473.[34] In the same year, Kohl's requested financing from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin to finance the building of a new headquarters in the municipality. Kohl's received 2 million dollars, the first of five installments that would equal a total payout of 12 million dollars, and then backed out of the transaction.[35]
In 2015, Kohl's opened a test store built around selling only returned, yet as new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories. The store, called Off/Aisle by Kohl's, sells items at a marked down price. The stores have a restrictive return policy different from regular Kohl's stores.[36]
In early January 2017, Kohl's shares fell 19% in value, in what The Wall Street Journal said was "the stock's worst day on record."[37]
Stores[edit]
Kohl's uses a "racetrack" aisle that circles the entire store, a technique borrowed from discount stores.[38] In 2011, Kohl's announced plans to remodel 100 of its 1,100 locations. Changes included redone store sections, fitting rooms, and newer merchandise displays.[39] In 2012, a consumer investigation by CBS News discovered that Kohl's had engaged in the practice of marking up products in the weeks before a sale in order to make products appear as if they were being sold at discounted prices and artificially inflating the amount of the price mark-down.[40]
Private brands[edit]
Kohl's private brands, which include Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, and Apt.9 generate nearly half of the firm's $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's has plans to re-launch and reimagine the billion-dollar Sonoma brand for apparel and home goods.[41]

Croft & Barrow, men's and women's clothing and shoes.
Apt. 9, stylish clothing and shoes for young men and women.
Sonoma (since 1994), casual clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.
American Beauty, men's and women's patriotic clothing.
Tony Hawk, men's and boy's clothing and shoes.
Urban Pipeline, (since 2006[42]), casual clothing and shoes for men and boys.
Daisy Fuentes, women's clothing and shoes.
Jumping Beans, baby and children's clothing and shoes.
Tek Gear, active and athletic clothing and shoes for men, women, and children.

Marketing[edit]
In 2009, Kohl's hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi to strengthen the Kohl's brand via a series of national television and online/social media campaigns. One of the brand campaigns featured American professional athletes.[43][44]
