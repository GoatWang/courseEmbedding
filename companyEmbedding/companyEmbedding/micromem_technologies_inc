INDUSTRIES –  Micromem Technologies Inc.






















































































INDUSTRIES









 












 





MASTInc’s innovative HCS technology has application across a broad industry base – both as an improvement over current technologies and as a genesis of next-generation solutions. MASTInc’s combination of superior sensitivity, robust structure, cost effectiveness and small size enables a wide variety of applications within each industry sector, both unique and overlapping.
In addition, recognizing that each industrial sector has unique commercial and technical requirements, MASTInc has developed a flexible business model that optimizes the application of HCS technology within each industry and even down to the application level.

 
 
Among the many applications currently being explored by MASTInc and its partners:
• Radiation-hardened, environmentally robust solutions for Defense
• Cost effective solutions for consumer-oriented devices
• Highly sensitive solutions for life science and natural resource applications
• High temperature applications for the automotive industry



 
Oil & Gas Industry

  
MAST’s expertise in nanoparticle design and detection piqued the interest of two leading companies in the oil industry and has resulted in a long term development relationship on a number of industry issues.  Fracking has brought new growth, but also new challenges to oil exploration.  Concerns about the environmental impacts of fracking led our clients to work with us to develop particle detection instruments that both enhance the recovery of fossil fuels from existing wells, and also provide a method for insuring the purity of water in nearby water tables. MAST has also developed new minimally-invasive techniques for corrosion detection and monitoring within plants and pipelines, reducing the chance for spills and the costs of regular maintenance.
 
 

Automotive Industry



 
 
 
MAST, Inc’s robust MEMS technology is the foundation for numerous advanced solutions for the automotive industry, including detection and monitoring of engine oil and fluid impurities to prolong engine life, reduce maintenance costs and optimize performance.
In addition to traditional automotive applications (rotational and position sensing), our sensor technologies can be embedded within the engine to provide “real time” and continuous fluid analysis, including flow, temperature, pressure, and contaminant levels. MAST’s patented MEMs solution for real time measurement of wear materials in lubricating fluids also has broad application in marine, industrial, and alternative power sources – anywhere the quality of the lubricating fluid is critical to continuing operation of equipment.


 
Power Generation and Distribution

  
Technologies and solutions developed by MAST for the oil industry have been recently applied to challenges in the power utility industry. MAST has developed a patented technology that allows for MEMS sensors to float inside power transformers and reliably detect the magnitude and location of partial discharges. Partial discharges, if left unchecked, result in potentially dangerous levels of explosive gases that can result in transformer fires.  Our technology alerts operations and proactively suggest actions to prevent the loss of the transformer.
 
 

  
MAST has also developed a cost effective power line monitoring sensor platform that provides situational awareness along distribution feeders enabling utilities to operate and respond to potential problems based on prevailing conditions.  Additionally, MAST has partnered with Bright Energy Technologies to deploy innovative and low cost storage solutions to the utilities industry.

Toronto, Ontario and New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July
17, 2017) - Micromem Technologies Inc. (CSE: MRM) (OTCQB: MMTIF)
("Micromem") ("the Company") through its wholly owned subsidiary
Micromem Applied Sensor Technologies Inc. (MAST), announces it has
executed a product supply agreement with Repsol S.A. ("Repsol")
(MSE: REP) (OTCQX: REPYY) (
www.repsol.energy/en/).
Repsol is an integrated global energy company based in Madrid,
Spain, that carries
out upstream and downstream activities
worldwide and employs more than 24,000 people. Repsol is a
vertically integrated company and operates in all areas of the oil
and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining,
distribution,marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and
trading.
Repsol's business strategy now includes selling more of their
products by offering their clients real time condition monitoring
of their vehicle lubricants. Micromem and Repsol have agreed to
develop new innovative technology that will be of service to their
clients.
Repsol has become one of our early adopter partners acquiring
one of the RT-Lube analyzer fieldable units, as recently announced
on June 26, 2017, to be installed and evaluated on a large
stationary compressor which we anticipate to be a significant
global market for this MAST product. Repsol will now have a
priority position in the first manufacturing lot of our MEMS real
time condition monitoring platform.
The agreement allows for expansion of our relationship from the
current 500 buses to a target Repsol Market of over 30,000 buses
spread over several countries. Repsol, once meeting certain
targets, may acquire rights to several countries. The financial
terms of the agreement are not released at this time.
The Industrial Internet of Things is growing globally and as
adoption of this technology continues, Micromem's partnerships are
leading the way in providing analytics solutions to market segments
now striving to catch up to the 21st century.

spread over several countries. Repsol, once meeting certain
targets, may acquire rights to several countries. The financial
terms of the agreement are not released at this time.
