Vestar Capital Partners is a leading middle-market private equity firm specializing in management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity investments.
Headquartered in New York, with offices in Denver and Boston, we invest in companies with valuations from $100 million to $1 billion.  Our target equity investment is $50 million to $200 million.
Since our founding in 1988, Vestar has maintained a prudent, long-term approach to investing that has served us well throughout numerous business and economic cycles.  We have completed 79 investments, in companies with a total value of more than $40 billion.
We credit much of our success to a strong culture of partnership both within the firm and with our portfolio company management teams.  We value transparency and collaborative decision-making.  And with four founders continuing to manage the firm, we know first-hand the entrepreneurial spirit that drives our management teams to want to run a business as their own.
Supporting that spirit has been the business of Vestar for 30 years.
