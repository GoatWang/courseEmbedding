With more than 14 years of experience in the digital advertising space, Clark is a well-known advertising technology expert and digital marketing thought leader. Clark works closely with Marchex executives as well as with our sales and client-development teams to dig into what he is most passionate about – driving world-class service for customers.
Previously, Clark was Chairman of Razorfish, one of the largest digital marketing agencies in the world. He also held the roles of CEO and President during his tenure there. Clark’s background in shepherding offline advertisers into the online world in the late ‘90s and through the next decade transformed advertising performance for marketers. He sees the same parallel happening now with the rapid shift from desktop to mobile and believes that Marchex is uniquely positioned to meet this need.
