PALO ALTO, Calif., March 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vivo Capital, a healthcare investment firm with offices in Palo Alto, California, Beijing, and Shanghai, China, announced the final closing of Vivo Capital Fund VIII ("Vivo VIII") at $750 million, which brings the firm's total funds under management to more than $1.7 billion. 
Vivo plans to invest the capital primarily in later development stage pharmaceutical and medical device companies in the U.S. and in revenue stage healthcare companies in greater China.  Vivo plans to continue assisting companies in both countries in their efforts to forge cross-border partnerships, enabling companies to acquire new products and expand the market for their existing products.  Vivo also intends to continue its successful strategies of building companies from scratch, identifying later stage products with a high probability of FDA approval, and investing directly in public companies. 
Investors in Vivo VIII include pension funds, financial institutions, endowments, foundations, family offices, and fund of funds. In addition to limited partners that participated in Vivo's earlier funds, Vivo VIII added a number of new institutional investors from the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
