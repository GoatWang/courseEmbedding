Thilo Semmelbauer: Well, I think leadership always starts with a vision, a plan, I think. It can come from great inspiration or it can come from hard analytical and strategic work but it always starts with clarity of vision.
Thilo Semmelbauer: And I think the second part is getting other people on board. And that ultimately, I think, great leaders have a way of getting to know the people around them and motivating them.
Thilo Semmelbauer: You can’t motivate people who are all motivated by different things unless you get to know them, which requires listening, learning, observing, communicating–all those things to really connect so you can’t do it by yourself.
Thilo Semmelbauer: So I think it’s that combination of knowing where you want to go and being able to, at the end of the day, get others to follow. I think that’s what leadership is all about.
Thilo Semmelbauer: There’s a deeper thing perhaps underlying leadership that I didn’t mention and you’re making me think about it now. I think it’s kind of at the basic level of caring. So what does that mean?
Thilo Semmelbauer: I mean, caring about people. The people are going to help you. The people, together, are going to make it happen. And if you don’t care about them, it’s not going to work as well. It’s only going to work for a short time period.
Thilo Semmelbauer: So there’s something I don’t know quite to how to put words around it. But the teams that I have built and the people I’ve worked with, it’s like a relationship. I care about them, I want them to succeed, they want me to succeed, and there’s a bond there, I think, that makes it special and sometimes makes it work and you can build magic together.
Dave Carvajal: And it’s amazing how that leadership, Thilo, has inspired so many people in their own leadership growth and how they choose to lead and the active decision that they make in understanding how to be a better leader, creating value in the world.
Thilo Semmelbauer: I hope so. There’s a lot of people that I’ve worked with over the years that I’m still in touch with that are in leadership positions and they call me and ask for advice and I give them what I can.
Thilo Semmelbauer: Most of it is within them and they maybe need some help bringing it out. And that’s very gratifying, to see people move on and do amazing things. That’s part of the fun for me.
Thilo Semmelbauer: Yeah, it’s building great products and having impact on people’s lives but it’s also the relationships with the people you work with that is very gratifying.

Thilo Semmelbauer: Two experiences worth mentioning when I started Weight Watchers online business, there was no revenue. It grew to a peak of about 400 million in revenue with, probably more importantly, millions of users. Many of them satisfied and some of them having had significant life changes, which was very gratifying.
Thilo Semmelbauer: Shutterstock is probably one of the things I’m most proud of in my career and during my time there, it grew from 50 million to 350 million in revenue over the course of five years.
Dave Carvajal: Yeah, and there was an IPO in there as well.
Thilo Semmelbauer: There was an IPO, which was I think a great confirmation for this sort of staying power in the company and the impact that it has on the industry.
Dave Carvajal: Thilo, what is the impact of some of your greatest achievements? What are you most proud of?
Thilo Semmelbauer: Yeah, well I mean, I think at Weight Watchers, the whole brand is around helping people so that’s something I really connected with. I mean, helping people lead healthier lives, lose weight, make personal transformations.
Thilo Semmelbauer: Weight Watchers had been doing that for 40 years but we were trying to bring that into the online experience as well and I think one of the most exciting things that happened after we built and launched the product was seeing people purchase it online. I mean, watching the ticker that people were actually buying what we built.
Thilo Semmelbauer: But, I think that paled in comparison to hearing stories of people months later and over the years that had success with it, with either right in or…
Thilo Semmelbauer: I would meet users, after having millions of users, it was not so hard to people who would just come up to me and say, “Wow, you were involved with Weight Watchers online. It really helped me, I lost 30 pounds. I became healthier. This happened, that happened.” And to hear those stories that people’s lives changed in some way, that made me feel great.
Thilo Semmelbauer: It happened at Shutterstock as well, although in different ways. I mean, even before I got there, the concept behind the Shutterstock subscription offering was very appealing.
Thilo Semmelbauer: But once we blew it out and got a lot more users on the platform and made the product better and improved the content, one woman came up to me who’s a customer who said, “We used Shutterstock so much we’ve turned it into a verb. In office, when we have a creative problem we say, ‘Hey, let’s Shutterstock it.’
Thilo Semmelbauer: And they go on the site and they got lots of ideas. And I had never thought about Shutterstock that way but the fact that it was getting such heavy use and had such appeal for creative people. That was very powerful.
Thilo Semmelbauer: And I think Shutterstock, being a marketplace business, equally powerful where some of the stories on the contributor side. I mean, photographers, videographers all over the world.
Thilo Semmelbauer: One woman, I remember we invited her into the office, who worked from her home in a small town in Siberia halfway around the world selling her images and her illustrations to customers all over the world and she was making a living doing that.
Thilo Semmelbauer: And there’s probably no way she would be able to pursue that passion without Shutterstock, so again, maybe small ways but important ways of touching people’s lives. I mean, that’s exciting.

Email: tsemmelbauer@insightpartners.com Assistant: Erica Harris 



Thilo Semmelbauer joined Insight as a Venture Partner in 2015 and works with portfolio companies to accelerate growth, resolve key strategic and operational issues, and build scalable organizations. Thilo also supports new opportunities, with a focus on Internet, subscription, and marketplace businesses.
Thilo has been involved in technology ventures for over 25 years, most recently as President and COO of Shutterstock (NYSE: SSTK), a global marketplace for licensing images, videos, and music to businesses worldwide. Under Thilo’s leadership, revenue grew from $60M to over $300M, and the business expanded into new areas, including video, music, and premium imagery. Shutterstock completed a successful IPO in October 2012, and subsequently delivered eight consecutive beat-and-raise quarters as a public company.
In the early 1990s, Thilo worked for an internal startup at Motorola, where he launched Motorola’s first consumer wireless “communicator” (the Envoy), and then launched Motorola’s first cable modem for broadband Internet access. In 1996, Thilo joined The Boston Consulting Group, focused on Consumer and Technology strategy, including projects in medical imaging, digital printing, and online retail. While at BCG, he helped launch Sotheby’s online auction business. In 2000, Thilo co-founded and was President & COO of WeightWatchers.com, which became the global leader in online weight loss and was acquired in 2005 by the licensor, Weight Watchers International. Thilo then served as COO of the combined companies, where he oversaw revenue growth from $1.2B to $1.6B through 2008.
Thilo lives in NY with his wife, and enjoys traveling, sailing, and photography. He is on the Board of Action Against Hunger, a global humanitarian organization committed to ending world hunger.
Thilo holds a dual masters degree from MIT, in Management and Electrical Engineering, from the Leaders for Global Operations program, as well as a BA in Engineering and Computer Science from Dartmouth College, summa cum laude.
