RidgeWorth Investments Launches New Mutual Fund

Feb 22, 2016, 09:17 ET
		  		  					
						 from   RidgeWorth Investments 











 
















































 

 




















 


ATLANTA, Feb. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- RidgeWorth Investments today announced the launch of the RidgeWorth Capital Innovations Global Resources and Infrastructure Fund (INNNX), a mutual fund invested in a diversified portfolio of globally listed companies whose main operations are focused in the agribusiness, timber, and infrastructure industries. The Fund seeks to identify companies within these industries that are best positioned to capitalize on these sectors' fundamental strengths, and also seeks to provide investors with an income-generating portfolio through an indirect exposure to essential real assets. 
The Fund's portfolio managers can adapt to changing interest rate environments by utilizing a broad range of real asset-income investments including stocks, real estate investment trusts and master limited partnerships. "As income has decreased from traditional sources, we feel it's essential to seek higher yield through a broader global real asset strategy," says Michael D. Underhill, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Capital Innovations, LLC, subadviser to the RidgeWorth Capital Innovations Global Resources and Infrastructure Fund.
This new fund reflects RidgeWorth's mission to provide clients with access to quality asset managers who offer well-defined, proven investment solutions. "We are enthusiastic about this new relationship and to bring Capital Innovations' unique talents to our clients," said Ashi Parikh, CEO and CIO of RidgeWorth Investments. "Capital Innovations provides a distinct benefit through its focus on identifying opportunities in real asset investing," he added.
Capital Innovations was founded in 2007 by partners Michael D. Underhill and Susan L. Dambekaln who each possess decades of experience working with institutional investors worldwide. Their management approach takes a long-term view, believing that macroeconomic forecasting, authoritative sector and security analysis, as well as rigorous risk management, effectively address the challenges of investing in volatile global markets. The firm provides precise engineering, competitive construction and unique ideas to investment solutions and invests with an approach anchored by a disciplined, risk-focused process.
"The Fund's systematic approach is complementary to the other strategies that reside within the RidgeWorth Investments product line. Income and growth are components of a successful portfolio and we're confident that this new fund will help RidgeWorth's clients address those needs," said Underhill. "We are excited about the opportunity to work with RidgeWorth Investments and believe our people, process and philosophy align well," he added.
"It's a priority for us to have an ongoing pipeline of innovative products to keep up with the ever-changing investing landscape," Parikh said. "Both of the Fund's managers are specialists in real assets with experience in a wide array of alternative-income opportunities. We are confident in the inherent advantages we see in Capital Innovations' investment strategy and believe our clients will benefit from their unique approach to investing."

About RidgeWorth Investments RidgeWorth Investments, a global investment management firm headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with $37.7 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015, offers investors access to a select group of boutique investment managers and subadvisers. RidgeWorth wholly owns three boutiques: Ceredex Value Advisors LLC, Seix Investment Advisors LLC and Silvant Capital Management LLC, and holds a minority ownership in Zevenbergen Capital Investments LLC. WCM Investment Management and Capital Innovations, LLC serve as subadvisers to the RidgeWorth Funds. Through these six investment managers, RidgeWorth offers a wide variety of fixed income and equity disciplines, providing investment management services to a growing client base that includes institutional, individual and high net worth investors. For more information about RidgeWorth, its boutiques and its subadvisers, visit www.ridgeworth.com.
All investments involve risk. There is no guarantee a specific investment strategy will be successful. Equity securities (stocks) may be more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments, including investments in high-grade, fixed-income securities. The net asset value per share of a fund will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes. International investing involves increased risk and volatility due to currency fluctuations, economic and political conditions, and differences in financial reporting standards. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries, the Fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. Individual investors are advised to consult with their investment professional about their specific financial needs and goals before making any investment decisions.
Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus or summary prospectus and consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please call 1-888-784-3863 or visit www.Ridgeworth.com to obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, which contains this and other information about the funds.

Investment Risks: Bonds offer a relatively stable level of income, although bond prices will fluctuate providing the potential for principal gain or loss. Intermediate-term, higher-quality bonds generally offer less risk than longer-term bonds and a lower rate of return. Generally, a strategy’s fixed income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and vice versa. Although a strategy’s yield may be higher than that of fixed income strategies that purchase higher-rated securities, the potentially higher yield is a function of the greater risk that the fund’s share price will decline. Mortgage-backed investments involve risk of loss due to prepayments and, like any bond, due to default. Because of the sensitivity of mortgage-related securities to changes in interest rates, a strategy’s performance may be more volatile than if it did not hold these securities. U.S. Government guarantees apply only to the underlying securities of a strategy's portfolio and not the strategy’s shares. Floating rate loans are typically senior and secured, in contrast to other below investment grade securities. However, there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral will not decline, causing a loan to be substantially unsecured. Loans generally are subject to restrictions on resale. Certain types of loans may limit the ability of a strategy to enforce its rights and may involve assuming additional credit risks. The geographical concentration of portfolio holdings in a strategy may involve increased risk.

RidgeWorth Investments Launches New Mutual Fund






Feb 22, 2016, 9:17am EST














ATLANTA, Feb. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- RidgeWorth Investments today announced the launch of the RidgeWorth Capital Innovations Global Resources and Infrastructure Fund (INNNX), a mutual fund invested in a diversified portfolio of globally listed companies whose main operations are focused in the agribusiness, timber, and infrastructure industries. The Fund seeks to identify companies within these industries that are best positioned to capitalize on these sectors' fundamental strengths, and also seeks to provide investors with an income-generating portfolio through an indirect exposure to essential real assets. 
The Fund's portfolio managers can adapt to changing interest rate environments by utilizing a broad range of real asset-income investments including stocks, real estate investment trusts and master limited partnerships. "As income has decreased from traditional sources, we feel it's essential to seek higher yield through a broader global real asset strategy," says Michael D. Underhill, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Capital Innovations, LLC, subadviser to the RidgeWorth Capital Innovations Global Resources and Infrastructure Fund.
This new fund reflects RidgeWorth's mission to provide clients with access to quality asset managers who offer well-defined, proven investment solutions. "We are enthusiastic about this new relationship and to bring Capital Innovations' unique talents to our clients," said Ashi Parikh, CEO and CIO of RidgeWorth Investments. "Capital Innovations provides a distinct benefit through its focus on identifying opportunities in real asset investing," he added.
Capital Innovations was founded in 2007 by partners Michael D. Underhill and Susan L. Dambekaln who each possess decades of experience working with institutional investors worldwide. Their management approach takes a long-term view, believing that macroeconomic forecasting, authoritative sector and security analysis, as well as rigorous risk management, effectively address the challenges of investing in volatile global markets. The firm provides precise engineering, competitive construction and unique ideas to investment solutions and invests with an approach anchored by a disciplined, risk-focused process.
"The Fund's systematic approach is complementary to the other strategies that reside within the RidgeWorth Investments product line. Income and growth are components of a successful portfolio and we're confident that this new fund will help RidgeWorth's clients address those needs," said Underhill. "We are excited about the opportunity to work with RidgeWorth Investments and believe our people, process and philosophy align well," he added.
"It's a priority for us to have an ongoing pipeline of innovative products to keep up with the ever-changing investing landscape," Parikh said. "Both of the Fund's managers are specialists in real assets with experience in a wide array of alternative-income opportunities. We are confident in the inherent advantages we see in Capital Innovations' investment strategy and believe our clients will benefit from their unique approach to investing."

To learn more about Capital Innovations, LLC, visit www.capinnovations.com.
About RidgeWorth Investments RidgeWorth Investments, a global investment management firm headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with $37.7 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015, offers investors access to a select group of boutique investment managers and subadvisers. RidgeWorth wholly owns three boutiques: Ceredex Value Advisors LLC, Seix Investment Advisors LLC and Silvant Capital Management LLC, and holds a minority ownership in Zevenbergen Capital Investments LLC. WCM Investment Management and Capital Innovations, LLC serve as subadvisers to the RidgeWorth Funds. Through these six investment managers, RidgeWorth offers a wide variety of fixed income and equity disciplines, providing investment management services to a growing client base that includes institutional, individual and high net worth investors. For more information about RidgeWorth, its boutiques and its subadvisers, visit www.ridgeworth.com.
All investments involve risk. There is no guarantee a specific investment strategy will be successful. Equity securities (stocks) may be more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments, including investments in high-grade, fixed-income securities. The net asset value per share of a fund will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes. International investing involves increased risk and volatility due to currency fluctuations, economic and political conditions, and differences in financial reporting standards. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries, the Fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. Individual investors are advised to consult with their investment professional about their specific financial needs and goals before making any investment decisions.
Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus or summary prospectus and consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please call 1-888-784-3863 or visit www.Ridgeworth.com to obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, which contains this and other information about the funds.
