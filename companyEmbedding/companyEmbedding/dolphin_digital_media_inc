The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	42West became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the
	“42West Acquisition”). 42West is an entertainment
	public relations agency offering talent publicity, strategic
	communications and entertainment content marketing...




	 




	The
	consideration paid by the Company in connection with the 42West
	Acquisition was approximately $18.7 million in shares of common
	stock of the Company, par value $0.015 (the “Common
	Stock”), based on the Company’s 30-trading-day average
	stock price prior to the closing date of $4.61 per share (less
	certain working capital and closing adjustments, transaction
	expenses and payments of indebtedness), plus the potential to earn
	up to an additional $9.3 million in shares of Common Stock. As a
	result, the Company (i) issued 1,230,280 shares of Common Stock on
	the closing date (the “Initial Consideration”), (ii)
	will issue (a) 344,550 shares of Common Stock to certain employees
	within 30 days of the closing date, (b) 118,655 shares of Common
	Stock as bonuses during 2017 and (c) approximately 1,961,821 shares
	of Common Stock on January 2, 2018 (the "Post-Closing
	Consideration") and (iii) may issue approximately 1,963,126 shares
	of Common Stock based on the achievement of specified financial
	performance targets over a three-year period as set forth in the
	Purchase Agreement (the "Earn-Out Consideration", and together with
	the Initial Consideration and the Post-Closing Consideration, the
	"Consideration").




	 




	Each of
	Leslee Dart, Amanda Lundberg and Allan Mayer (the “Principal
	Sellers”) has entered into employment agreements with the
	Company and will continue as employees of the Company for a
	three-year term after the closing of the 42West Acquisition. Each
	of the employment agreements of the Principal Sellers contains
	lock-up provisions pursuant to which each Principal Seller has
	agreed not to transfer any shares of Common Stock in the first
	year, no more than 1/3 of the Initial Consideration and
	Post-Closing Consideration received by such Seller in the second
	year and no more than an additional 1/3 of the Initial
	Consideration and Post-Closing Consideration received by such
	Seller in the third year, following the closing date. The
	non-executive employees of 42West are expected to be retained as
	well. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations,
	warranties and covenants.




	 




	In
	connection with the 42West Acquisition, on March 30, 2017, the
	Company entered into put agreements (the “Put
	Agreements”) with each of the Sellers. Pursuant to the terms
	and subject to the conditions set forth in the Put Agreements, the
	Company has granted the Sellers the right, but not obligation, to
	cause the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,374,187 of
	their shares of Common Stock received as Consideration for a
	purchase price equal to $4.61 per share during certain specified
	exercise periods set forth in the Put Agreements up until December
	2020.




	 




	In
	addition, in connection with the 42West Acquisition, on March 30,
	2017, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with
	the Sellers (the “Registration Rights Agreement”)
	pursuant to which the Sellers are entitled to rights with respect
	to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
	(the “Securities Act”). All fees, costs and expenses of
	underwritten registrations under the Registration Rights Agreement
	will be borne by the Company. At any time after the one-year
	anniversary of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will
	be required, upon the request of such Sellers holding at least a
	majority of the Consideration received by the Sellers, to
	file a registration statement on Form S-1 and use its
	reasonable efforts to effect a registration covering up to 25% of
	the Consideration received by the Sellers. In addition, if the
	Company is eligible to file a registration statement on
	Form S-3, upon the request of such Sellers holding at least a
	majority of the Consideration received by the Sellers, the Company
	will be required to use its reasonable efforts to effect a
	registration of such shares on Form S-3 covering up to an
	additional 25% of the Consideration received by the Sellers. The
	Company is required to effect only one registration on Form S-1 and
	one registration statement on Form S-3, if eligible. The right to
	have the Consideration received by the Sellers registered on
	Form S-1 or Form S-3 is subject to other specified conditions
	and limitations.




	 




	The
	foregoing descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, the Form of Put
	Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to
	be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
	Purchase Agreement, Form of Put Agreement and Registration Rights
	Agreement that will be filed.

	Dolphin Digital Media Acquires PR
	Powerhouse 42West







	 




	New integrated entertainment and communications company
	combines




	content creation, marketing expertise, and digital savvy all under
	one roof




	 





	NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES

	– March 30, 2017 –
	/PRNewswire/ – Dolphin Digital Media (OTCBB: DPDM), a
	publicly-traded independent producer of premium feature films and
	digital content, today announced that it has acquired 42West, one
	of the largest independently-owned public-relations and marketing
	services firms in the entertainment industry. Under the terms of
	the transaction agreement, the aggregate consideration will be
	approximately $28 million, to be paid in shares of Dolphin common
	stock. The aggregate consideration includes performance-based
	contingent consideration of up to $9.3 million to be paid over a
	three year period.




	 




	“From
	the standpoint of content creation, having a quality marketing
	strategy and the ability to execute it are as important as the
	quality of the product itself,” said Dolphin Digital Media
	CEO Bill O’Dowd. “Simply put, you must be heard to be
	seen. In today’s highly competitive entertainment
	environment, with billions of dollars spent annually on the
	production and marketing of feature films and more than 500
	original scripted television and digital series available to the
	consumer each year, 42West’s experience and expertise are
	invaluable. Bringing them into the Dolphin family will give us the
	ability to evaluate any project’s marketing potential prior
	to its greenlight, and further allow us to develop its marketing
	strategy prior to the start of production.”




	 




	“Leslee,
	Amanda, and Allan are industry leaders at the top of their
	game,“ added Mr. O’Dowd, referring to 42West principal
	partners Leslee Dart, Amanda Lundberg, and Allan Mayer.
	“They, along with their senior management team, have built
	42West into a best-in-class entertainment marketing powerhouse that
	combines an unparalleled A-list celebrity client roster with an
	elite roll of corporate clients that includes virtually every major
	studio, pay television network, and important digital platform.
	This unique combination of individual and project marketing creates
	tremendous opportunities for strategic partnerships, from new
	content creation to consumer brands and beyond.”




	 




	“In
	Dolphin, we’ve found a kindred spirit as well as a strategic
	partner,” Dart, Lundberg, and Mayer said in a joint
	statement. “At a time of enormous innovation in the
	entertainment and media industries, we’re delighted to be
	joining up with a ground-breaking, accomplished organization that
	can provide us with the broad platform and ample resources to take
	full advantage of the many exciting opportunities before us. In
	particular, we look forward to developing our capabilities in
	content creation, which will enable us to create additional value
	for our clients. Bill O’Dowd and his team at Dolphin
	understand and appreciate what we do, and together we'll be able to
	execute at an even higher level.”




	 




	 “We
	believe this transaction also provides strong financial benefits
	for the combined company,” said Mr. O’Dowd.
	“We’ve been extremely impressed with 42West's
	profitability and consistent revenue growth, and with the
	significant percentage of recurring revenue from its large stable
	of loyal clients.”




	 




	As a
	wholly-owned subsidiary of Dolphin Digital Media, 42West will
	continue to focus on talent publicity; movie, TV, and digital
	content marketing; multi-cultural marketing; and strategic
	communications counsel for the entertainment industry, operating
	under its own name, led by its existing management team, out of its
	existing offices in New York and Los Angeles, with Dart, Lundberg,
	and Mayer serving as co-chief executive officers.


	Canaccord Genuity served as exclusive financial advisor to Dolphin
	Digital Media.  Greenberg Traurig LLP served as legal counsel
	to Dolphin Digital Media and Davis & Gilbert LLP served as
	legal counsel to 42West.






	 








	 










	 






	 




	This
	press release does not constitute an offer of any securities for
	sale. The shares of common stock to be issued in the acquisition
	have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent

	42West
	grew out of The Dart Group, which was launched by Leslee Dart in
	2004. Amanda Lundberg teamed up with Dart a few months later. In
	2006, after Allan Mayer joined the partnership, the company was
	rechristened 42West. Since then, the firm’s PR professionals
	have developed and executed marketing and publicity strategies for
	hundreds of movies, television shows, and digital productions as
	well as for countless individual actors, filmmakers, recording
	artists, and authors. In addition 42West has also provided
	strategic communications counsel to a wide variety of high-profile
	individuals and corporate clients — ranging from movie and
	pop stars to major studios and media conglomerates. This past
	December, the New York Observer listed 42West as one of the top six
	most powerful PR firms of any kind in the United
	States.

	control and the risk factors and other cautionary statements
	described in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including
	the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission
	on March 31, 2016 as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on
