IMPCO Light Weight RAPU2174 Rail Diesel APU 

Kitchener, ON –IMPCO Technologies, Inc., a global leader in the alternative fuel industry and a division of Westport Fuel Systems Inc., has reaffirmed the release of its new Heavy-Duty/Light Weight Rail Auxiliary Power Unit.
This innovative technology, developed in collaboration with the railroad industry expert Canadian Environmental Technologies ("CET"), was presented in March 2015 at the ASLRRA Show in Orlando. It then launched at the Rail Interchange Show in Minneapolis, in October 2015, where it was received very positively by the market.
IMPCO’s Light Weight Rail Auxiliary Power Unit generates great fuel savings, while guaranteeing engine heating, battery charge and cabin comfort. A Perkins/CAT 3 cylinder diesel engine powers a durable alternator capable of delivering up to 150A of 72V DC current, whilst providing the required heat to keep the locomotive engine warm, even in extreme cold weather.
The advanced control system and software allows safe operation of the unit and protects the locomotive by continuously monitoring the water temperature and state-of-charge of the batteries. The product is designed for minimized weight and footprint, low maintenance, minimum downtime and maximized fuel savings.
IMPCO’s new Auxiliary Power Unit is distributed globally and exclusively by Canadian Environmental Technologies ("CET") for all aftermarket applications.

Westport Expands MY2017 Ford Product Line
 Environmental Protection Agency Certifies Westport’s Emission-Reducing WiNG™ Power System on Multiple Ford Platforms
published: November 28, 2016
VANCOUVER, BC – Westport, engineering the world's most advanced natural gas engines and vehicles, today announced it has received certification from the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for its Westport WiNG™ Power System on multiple 2017 Model Year (“MY”) Ford products.
As a leading developer and installer in Ford’s Qualified Vehicle Modifier ("QVM") program, Westport has the largest line-up of Ford alternative fueled vehicles; offering fleets a diverse choice of fuel from a single provider.
Westport has also streamlined the supply chain through a Ford-approved Ship-Thru process on the F-150, F-250/350 and Transit products, reducing transportation costs and simplifying the ordering process. Once the Westport WiNG™ Power System is installed, calibrated, and validated, the alternative fuel vehicles are returned to the Ford transportation system and delivered to the customer.

“As one of the most experienced and trusted names in alternative fuel systems, our EPA certified expanded product line meets all Ford OEM safety requirements, quality engineering and design,” said Paul Shaffer, Vice President & Managing Director of Westport DOEM North America. “Ford backed warranty, financing and ship- thru ordering, combined with a nationwide network of trained technicians, provides fleets with a seamless ordering experience and more fuel choices from a single full service provider.

EPA certifications have been received for compressed natural gas (“CNG”) and liquid propane gas (“LPG”) models:

F-150 5.0L CNG and LPG
Transit 3.7L CNG
F-450/550/650/750/53/59 6.8L CNG
E-450 6.8L CNG

It is one thing to work with revolutionary products and technologies but it is even more exciting to be part of the challenge to reshape a standard product to create the future of an industry. Westport is the leader in creating breakthrough technologies in natural gas engines, vehicles and fuel system components. Westport imagines, builds, demonstrates and commercializes technologies that provide environmental and economic solutions to customers, while delivering best-class performance and operational characteristics for clean, sustainable and commercially viable transportation.
Westport pioneered high pressure direct injection technology, Westport™ HPDI 1.0, which was a ground-breaking product and great success in opening up the heavy duty natural gas trucking industry. In this film, we look at Westport’s next generation of technologies, including Westport™ HPDI 2.0, advanced spark-ignited natural gas technology, and novel conformable CNG and cryogenic LNG fuel storage technologies.
Westport is committed to giving tomorrow’s visionaries license to explore—by designing the most advanced natural gas engines the world has ever seen. Not just for cars and trucks. But for any vehicle that carries a payload, crosses the water, or thunders down the tracks.

Partners
Built stronger than the sum of our parts.













Westport leverages its proprietary technologies by partnering with leading diesel engine and vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to develop, manufacture and distribute natural gas engines to a diverse group of global vehicle OEMs. Westport commercializes its technology in markets where demand for clean, low-emission engines is prevalent, including light-, medium-, and heavy-duty and high horsepower applications on the road or off.
Westport currently has strategic alliances with three of the world's top four engine producers, and supplies or has strategic alliances with six of the world's top ten truck producers. In the light-duty market, Westport supplies or has strategic relationships with seven of the world's top ten automotive OEMs. 
Why Partner?
Our strategic relationships with OEMs provide us with access to their manufacturing capacity, supply chain and global distribution networks without incurring the considerable investment associated with these assets.
Partner companies include stakeholders in various areas of the business:

natural gas fuel and infrastructure providers
global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
international government agencies
universities and research laboratories
industry-related organizations and alliances

Our partners are helping make our business plan a reality—to create sustainable transportation solutions that meet existing and future emissions regulations and targets for greenhouse gas reduction.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
