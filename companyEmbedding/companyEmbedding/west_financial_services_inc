In light of recent market volatility, remember that your investments in our retirement income offerings and insurance products are intended as long-term investments. Attempts to time the market are rarely successful. One way to manage risk over time is to ensure you have a diversified portfolio that is rebalanced through up-and-down markets. Keep your individual needs, goals and time horizon in mind and consult with your financial adviser if needed. It is important to note diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit and do not protect against loss in declining markets.

Investment Management

















An overview of our approach:

Strategic and Tactical Management
Since asset allocation is the driving force of portfolio performance, we maintain a long-term view over the entire business cycle. Our portfolios utilize diversification across global asset classes as their foundation while incorporating disciplined, research-driven tactical asset allocation adjustments.
Equity – Passive and Active
For equities, we utilize a “core and satellite” approach to investing. By using low-cost, core investments in major market indices, we ensure that clients participate in market movements. For the “satellite” portion of the portfolio, we use actively managed mutual funds to provide growth and value style exposure. We also purchase individual stocks for additional sector and dividend exposure. Our investment team pays close attention to valuation, establishes well-defined entry and exit points, and uses both quantitative and qualitative due diligence when investigating new investment opportunities.
Fixed Income
Our primary focus with fixed income is preservation of capital. We build a foundation of high quality bonds and ladder the maturities over a short to intermediate time period so that bonds mature each year. This strategy provides various maturities for reinvestment at different yields or for use of principal to meet future cash flow needs.
Independence
West Financial Services is an independent registered investment advisor (RIA).  We are able to select investments that combine strong, consistent performance with reasonable expenses.
Team Approach
Our team of experienced investment professionals meets on a daily basis to review proprietary and external research on macro-economic issues, changes to tax statutes, and due diligence on individual equities, fixed income and mutual funds. Through these meetings, we regularly evaluate the performance of our investments against the appropriate benchmarks to check that selected investments perform at the expected level.
Consistent Monitoring and Reporting
We continually monitor, measure and evaluate performance of our clients’ investments, and provide quarterly reporting as well as personal meetings to review accounts.
Minimizing Taxes and Expenses
All investment decisions are implemented in a manner that considers tax consequences as well as managerial and transactional expenses. The resulting savings means that more money is working for you.




The most treasured asset in investment management is a steady hand at the tiller. - Robert Arnott

About Us













When choosing a financial planning and investment management firm, individuals, businesses, foundations and associations share a common need: Expert guidance that helps them reach financial goals.




At West Financial Services, we have spent over 35 years building a firm dedicated to taking a conservative and ethical approach to growing and protecting our clients’ wealth and prosperity.  Since our inception in 1982, we have provided financial services on a fee-only basis, acting as a fiduciary for our clients.  Each member of our team fully embraces the importance of this role and what it means for our clients.  We bring planning excellence, investment discipline and personal service to everything we do.
Though every client is different, there is a common theme – they come to us when they are in need of support and coordination of various facets of their financial lives.

Whether issues relate to retirement, inheritance, divorce or job loss, we strive not only to protect clients’ wealth, but to provide guidance and education, as well as a sense of control and ownership of the decisions they make.
Though wide ranging in background and ages, our clients are primarily accomplished professionals who have built their wealth through business ownership, strong saving habits and long careers.
Clients may be risk takers in their businesses, but tend to be moderate to conservative risk investors.  They are looking to us as consultants who can bridge the gap between their work lives, existing personal investment and retirement assets, and their future cash flow, retirement and estate needs.

In all cases, we collaborate with clients’ professionals or specialists, or make introductions for clients when necessary.  We take a positive, proactive and consultative approach to understanding the needs and desires of each individual client or family.  Our goal is to anticipate obstacles and identify opportunities for our clients so that they have time to incorporate changes that create their best possible future.

The Clearing House and FIS Laud Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force’s Final Report


​Washington, DC – Today, The Clearing House (TCH) and FIS welcomed the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force’s final report which presents a roadmap for achieving competitive, safe, ubiquitous, and faster payments.  The Task Force was created by the Federal Reserve and is comprised of more than 300 stakeholders with an interest in U.S. payments.  The Task Force was called on to collectively identify criteria for end-to-end solutions that would produce effective 21st century payments systems and task force members were invited to put forward proposals that meet the Task Force’s recommendations.    
TCH and FIS were active participants in the Task Force’s initiative and submitted a joint proposal for evaluation of TCH’s Real-Time Payments (RTP) system, which is targeted to launch  later this year.  TCH enlisted the help of FIS to help achieve ubiquity by offering enhanced RTP services to more than 3,000 financial institutions.  
“The Federal Reserve Faster Payments Task Force’s final report marks a significant milestone in the path toward faster payments in the U.S.,” said Russ Waterhouse, Executive Vice President, Product Development and Strategy at The Clearing House.  “The Task Force ran an inclusive and collaborative process that resulted in recommendations that will drive better private sector solutions that benefit businesses and consumers across the country. Its work was instrumental in helping us design and build our real-time payments system, which we expect to start supporting transactions later this year.”
“FIS has been implementing real-time payment schemes around the globe since 2009 and we draw important lessons from these projects every day,” said Anthony Jabbour COO, Banking and Payments, FIS. “Speed, ubiquity and ease of use lead to high adoption rates and relevant payment solutions that banks can offer to their retail, small business and corporate clients. FIS understands the specialized risks inherent in a real time payments scheme, and that’s why we focus on minimizing risk to support systems, and ensure appropriate fraud prevention measures are taken into account. All this is vital to gain large-scale user uptake and thus turn a real-time payments vision into real-time business value for all.” 
The Task Force defined 36 effectiveness criteria grouped into the six categories: Ubiquity, Efficiency, Safety and Security, Speed (Fast), Legal, and Governance.  These criteria were critical in helping TCH as it worked to design and build its RTP system.  TCH and FIS were pleased that their proposal was found to have met each of the criteria necessary for a modern 21st century payment system established by the Task Force.   TCH’s RTP system also aligns with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “Consumer Protection Principles” for faster payment systems. 
About The Clearing HouseThe Clearing House is a banking association and payments company that is owned by the largest commercial banks and dates back to 1853.  The Clearing House Payments Company L.L.C. owns and operates core payments system infrastructure in the United States and is currently working to modernize that infrastructure by building a new, ubiquitous, real-time payment system.  The Payments Company is the only private-sector ACH and wire operator in the United States, clearing and settling nearly $2 trillion in U.S. dollar payments each day, representing half of all commercial ACH and wire volume.  Its affiliate, The Clearing House Association L.L.C., is a nonpartisan organization that engages in research, analysis, advocacy and litigation focused on financial regulation that supports a safe, sound and competitive banking system.

Over the years, he has developed a strategy of portfolio trading that involves a combination of stock holdings and options writing aimed at out performing the market index while minimizing the volatility of his portfolio. From time to time, he will do covered call writing as well as commodities trading for portfolio diversification. The main thrust of the options writing is to extract the time value of the options without having the options exercised. This involves a judicious choice of options with appropriate premiums for acceptable return and strike price that minimize risk level.  In cases where the options are assigned to purchase the underlying stocks, the stocks may be held for a period for appreciation. The options are usually chosen so that the underlying stocks are worthy of long-term holding in cases where they are assigned.Dr Lo has worked as an engineer, researcher and consultant in the oil industry for over 25 years. He also worked in planning for Gemstar Corp.  He had taught at Brown University in Engineering and Applied Mathematics prior to joining the oil industry.Dr. Lo holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology and a Ph.
