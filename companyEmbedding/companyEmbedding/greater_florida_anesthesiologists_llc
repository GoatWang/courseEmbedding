 is a private medical group. If you


have a question about our participation in a particular plan, please contact our billing office.
                                        
                                        	You will receive a bill from GFA for the services rendered by the anesthesiologist which is separate from the hospital's bill. The hospital's bill will include an "anesthesia" charge for the services of hospital-employed nurses and the hospital's cost of equipment and supplies. 
                                            
                                            For certain elective and cosmetic procedures, you may be required to prepay your anesthesiologist's fee, as well as the hospital or surgery center's bill and surgeon's fee. 
                                            
                                            Your surgeon may give you a form with our charges. Please bring this form with you to the pre-anesthesia interview prior to your operation. Our billing procedures will follow the payment policies of your particular plan. We will always submit a claim form on your behalf and notify you of any co-insurance or deductible responsibility. 
                                            
                                            Payment plans can be arranged when necessary. We accept American Express, Visa, MasterCard and Discover. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to call our Billing Office.

The Unicom Anesthesia Associates (UAA) division of GFA is comprised of 15 Board Certified/Board-Eligible Anesthesiologists and over 30 CRNAs and AAs. We have been providing high quality and comprehensive care for our patients and surgical colleagues for over 20 years. UAA provides a full range of anesthesia services for adults and children including general, regional, cardiac, obstetrical and specialized ambulatory surgery management. Our clinical venues include University Community Hospital (431 beds), associated Pepin Heart Hospital and Women's Center, the USF Health Surgery and Endoscopy Center at the Carol & Frank Morsani Center for Advanced Healthcare, as well as RMG/IVF Surgery Center and several privately owned outpatient surgery centers in the Tampa Bay area. Many of our anesthesiologists have advanced training in regional anesthesia, trans-esophageal echocardiography, ambulatory anesthesia, and ultra-sound guidance techniques.

                                          Our physicians are also active in the Florida Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Through our affiliation with the University of South Florida and Barry University, we train nurses to become CRNAs.

                                          Unicom Anesthesia's goal from inception has been to provide quality anesthesia care for our patients, optimum safety and efficiency for our surgeons, and to strive for the continued improvement and safety of anesthesia care in our community.
