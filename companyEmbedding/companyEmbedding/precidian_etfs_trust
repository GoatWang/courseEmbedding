What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

Do you Want a Currency-Hedged Fund Just Holding BUD???

By Crystal KimTagsAnheuser Busch InbevPrecidian ETFs Trust


Yesterday, Precidian ETFs Trust submitted a filing to the Securities & Exchange Commission, unveiling plans to roll out 19 currency-hedged, single-stock funds.
To be sure, there has been strong demand for international equity exchange-traded funds, collecting some $1.4 billion year-to-date through June 9, says CFRA’s Todd Rosenbluth. But these aren’t exactly ETFs.
These “funds” will not be tracking a specified index, and the filing does not explicitly call them ETFs. Here’s language around their creation/redemption mechanism:
Unlike conventional mutual funds, the Fund issues and redeems Shares on a continuous basis, at NAV, only in blocks of 50,000 Shares or whole multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants. The Fund’s Creation Units are issued and redeemed principally in-kind for Portfolio Securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) together with an amount of cash. Retail investors may purchase or sell Shares only in the Secondary Market. Shares of the Fund trade at market price rather than NAV. As such, Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).
Here is the full list of them:

Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)
AstraZeneca PLC (AZN)
Banco Santander (SAN)
BP (BP)
British American Tobacco (BTI)
Diageo (DEO)
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
HSBC Holdings (HSBC)
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MTU)
Novartis (NVS)
Novo Nordisk (NVO)
NTT DoCoMo (DCM)
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) (RDSB)
Sanofi (SNY)
SAP (SAP)
Total (TOT)
Toyota Motor (TM)
Vodafone (VOD)

But do investors really need these things?
