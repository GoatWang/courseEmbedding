Wine Profile

Tasting Notes
The 2014 John C. Sullenger Cabernet Sauvignon shows flavorful expressions of bright fruits, savory herbs and toasty oak. Seductive aromas of plum, olive and earth entice the taster and carry through to the palate, alongside flavors of black cherry, tobacco and sage. Balanced acidity and spicy oak complement the dark, rich fruits while round, supple tannins build the midpalate. Approachable now, this wine will continue to develop over the next 10 years.


Vineyard Notes
The home vineyard of Nickel & Nickel, Sullenger Vineyard is situated behind the winery in the heart of Oakville and is named for John C. Sullenger, who settled the farmstead in the 1880s. The vineyard’s 30 acres of clay loam soil are planted exclusively to Cabernet Sauvignon, with two rootstocks and a few different clones, which each add a unique element to the resulting wine.
