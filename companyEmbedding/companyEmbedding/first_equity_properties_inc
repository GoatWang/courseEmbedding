UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST     FIRST EQUITY PROPERTIES INC (726516) 10-Q published on May 15, 2017 at 12:23 pm Reporting Period: Mar 30, 2017The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations, although management believes the disclosures are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring matters) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.The year-end Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, was derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Costs related to planning and developing a project are capitalized and classified as Real Estate development costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We capitalized certain operating expenses until development is substantially complete, but no later than one year from the cessation of major development activity.Receivables from related parties primarily consist of two notes of $1,565,292 and $489,154 which are due to the Company in quarterly installments of interest only. The notes accrue interest at 10% per annum.  The maturity date of these notes has been extended to December 31, 2017. A payment was received in March 2017 for $51,783 which paid the remaining interest balance due in 2016.We reported net loss applicable to common shareholders of ($18,049) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss to common shareholders of ($17,680) for the same period ended 2016.       				© Ez-XBRL Solutions, Inc.
