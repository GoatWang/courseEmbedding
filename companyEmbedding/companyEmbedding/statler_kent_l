Executive Profiles









Find out how Kent Statler’s value system has helped him achieve success in multiple roles.

Kent Statler remembers well the first day of summer vacation and the long list of things that needed to be accomplished prior to the start of the next school year.
Building fences, pouring concrete and baling hay weren’t exactly the way a high school boy wanted to spend his time away from the classroom. But in the early 1980s, working hard and working together on the family farm was simply a way of life.
Three decades have passed since one of his father’s infamous to-do lists has been compiled, but the lessons Statler and his older siblings learned during those hot summer days in eastern Iowa continue to guide him in his current role as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Commercial Systems.
“A lot of who you are comes from your parents,” said Statler. “I am definitely my own person, but my strong value system, my results-driven approach and my desire to make a difference were without a doubt instilled by my dad and mom.”

Climbing the corporate ladderA graduate of the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls with a Bachelor of Arts degree in production management and economics, Statler’s career with Rockwell Collins began on the production floor the day after he received his college diploma.
“I graduated on a Sunday, and started working on a Monday,” recalled Statler, who married his high school sweetheart, Julie, the summer before his senior year in college. “I think being married and having our first child on the way had something to do with that quick transition from college life to the real world.”
During the first eight years of his career, Statler rotated through several positions that provided him with insight to the operations side of our business. From production, assembly and test foreman, to production control manager and industrial engineering manager, Statler learned more about our company and our products with each new challenge he faced.
In 1994, his climb up the corporate ladder continued when he became one of our company’s first Integrated Product Team leaders. Two years later, the career path led him to Coralville, Iowa, where he assumed responsibilities as plant manager.
“I’ve always enjoyed leading large, diverse organizations and I get really excited about taking people to places they don’t believe they can go,” said Statler. “The experiences I had during those first 12 years taught me a lot and really helped prepare me for that next step.”
As part of an enterprise-wide job rotation plan, Statler returned to Cedar Rapids in 1998 and entered the world of Collins Aviation Services (CAS), which today is part of Rockwell Collins’ International and Service Solutions. As the vice president of Maintenance Operations, he was responsible for our service centers and services bases, which are located around the world.
With a vast amount of experience and a Master of Business Administration degree in hand — which he earned in 1998 from The University of Iowa — Statler was now ready to make one of the largest leaps of his career.

Surrounding himself with talented leadersIn January 2001, at the age of 36, he became vice president of Lean Electronics, reporting directly to Clay Jones who was then Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. From there, Statler served as the senior vice president of Operations before then assuming responsibilities for Rockwell Collins Services as executive vice president. In February 2010, he was named to his current role as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Commercial Systems.
In his current role, he is responsible for leading the Commercial Systems business, which produces aviation electronics and communications for the air transport, business aviation and regional airline markets. 
“I’ve definitely kept my competitive spirit over the years, but I’ve learned along the way that I can’t succeed on my own,” said Statler. “If you surround yourself with high potential people and provide them with stretch objectives, they will help you succeed.”

Importance of familyIn addition to surrounding himself with outstanding leaders, Statler admits he would not be the man he is today if it weren’t for his wife, Julie, and their three grown children — Jessica, Ben and Joshua — helping him maintain a healthy balance between his career and his personal life.
“Without a doubt, my family is the most important thing in my life,” said Statler. “My wife and I have been married for 27 years and we dated for five years before that. Watching our kids grow up has been so rewarding — it’s something I would never change.”
Even though their kids are grown, he and his wife enjoy spending time with them whenever possible. But the couple also is discovering that life as empty-nesters is quite pleasant, as well. They now have more opportunity to go out for dinner – just the two of them. Traveling also is something the couple enjoys doing together, especially internationally. 

Leaving a legacy behindEven though the company veteran is still a fairly young man, Statler also realizes that retirement isn’t as far away as it once used to be.
“I’ve been with this company for 27 years,” he said. “I can’t believe how quickly the time has passed.”
When the day comes that he is able to trade in his daily work responsibilities for a permanent tee time on his favorite area golf course, he simply wants to look back on his career and hope he made a positive impact on those he’s leaving behind.
“I really enjoy being part of something special,” said Statler. “The people I have had and will continue to have the opportunity to work with are really the legacy I hope to leave behind. If our business continues to grow and run smoothly after I’m gone, then I have succeeded in my mission as a leader.”

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
