Diane K. Comyne, age 71, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, January 31, 2017. She was born on June 22, 1945, in Milwaukee, the daughter to Jack and Lorraine (Kelln) Reimer. Diane married her high school sweetheart, Robert Comyne on June 5, 1965 in Milwaukee. Together they raised two daughters.

Diane danced her way through life with a "can do" attitude". Her family and friends would often refer to her as a "pit-bull with lipstick". Diane loved and adored her husband, children, grand-children and great- granddaughter.  She had an essence for making her family meals special during the holidays. Traveling and gambling with her husband, Robert, gave Diane great joy and wonderful memories.

Diane is survived by her husband, Robert; her daughters, Michelle(Cal) Hetzel and Kimberly (Eric Lamberton) Comyne; her grandchildren, Katie (Biko Mulera) Hetzel, Alyssa (Zach Gholston) Lamberton and Michael (Naomi)Lamberton; her great- granddaughter, Scarlett; her sisters Phyllis Gromacki and Gail Kelln; she also leaves behind many family and friends. She was preceded in death by her parents.

A funeral service will be held at Cress Funeral Home, 1310 Emerald Terrace, Sun Prairie on Monday, February 6, 2017 at 5:30 pm. A visitation will be held from 3:30 pm until time of service at funeral home. 

Diane will be laid to rest in Milwaukee at Pine Lawn Memorial Park.
