Exhibit
99.1
CERTIFICATION OF SERVICES PERFORMED
 
November 10, 2016
 
Reference is made
to that certain Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) to be entered into by and between Progress Residential
2016-2 Borrower, LLC (“Borrower”) and German American Capital Corporation (“Client”).
Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Loan Agreement.
I do hereby certify
to Borrower and Client, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that Green River Capital, LLC (“GRC”)
has completed certain due diligence services ordered by Client under the Evaluation Services Agreement dated November 9,2016, between
GRC and Client, in connection with the borrowing of the Loan for certain residential rental properties (the “Properties”
and each, a “Property”) contained in the data tape entitled “Progress 2016-SFR2 Data Tape 09-30-2016
v06_Password.xlsx” dated as of September 30, 2016 (the “Data Tape”). Not all of the Properties
included in the Data Tape may ultimately be included in the pool of residential properties securing the Loan. Furthermore;
1.	GRC has reviewed
the Lease for each Property provided by Client and has determined that (a) each such Lease has been executed by the applicable
tenant, (b) the monthly rental payment under each such Lease and the Lease commencement and expiration dates match the information
included in the Data Tape and (c) all Section 8 Leases are correctly reported as such on the Data Tape.
2.	GRC has reviewed
the Data Tape and, based on a review of the Broker Price Opinion for each Property, GRC has verified that the values presented
on the Data Tape are correct.
3.	GRC has reviewed
the Data Tape, which indicates which Properties have or do not have an active homeowners’, condominium, or other common-interest
community association (“HOA”) and has confirmed, based on, among other things, including title review
and that certain letter provided by OS National, LLC dated on or about the date hereof (the “OS National Report”),
that the data provided by Borrower on the Data Tape is correctly reported except as otherwise set forth in the OS National Report.
4.	GRC has reviewed
the purchase documentation provided by the Borrower for each Property in order to compare the purchase price provided in the purchase
documents against the purchase price field included in the Data Tape. GRC has verified the correct values on the Data Tape.
5.	GRC has reviewed
the renovation costs by category for each Property that appears on the general ledger of Progress Residential Master Trust as provided
to GRC on October 26, 2016 and tied out such costs with the Data Tape for the following data fields: land improvements, swimming
pools, building improvements, carpeting, roof, HVAC, stove, washer and dryer, refrigerator, dishwasher, carpet replacement, closing
costs and capitalized soft costs.



 
 

6.	GRC has reviewed
a random sample of 27 properties from the Borrower’s Data Tape and verify with documentation provided by the Borrower that
the dollar amount corresponding to the Borrower’s stated actual rehabilitation spending reflected in the Borrower’s
data tape is accurate.
 
 
 
[Signature Page Follows]
 


 
 

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this certificate
to be executed as of the date set forth above.

Procedures Performed
 
Property File Review
 

1.Using the Initial Data Tape, we randomly selected 1,272 properties (the “Initial Sample Properties”) from the 5,048
properties represented on the Initial Data Tape for review. We make no representations as to the adequacy of the sample size, nor
do we draw any conclusions about the entire Initial Data Tape based on the sample size and results of the procedures performed.
 
For each of the Initial Sample Properties, using the information,
instruction, and assumptions provided by the Company and listed in Exhibit 1, we compared the Sample Attributes, as shown on the
Initial Data Tape, with the corresponding information in the applicable Source Documents provided by the Company. For the purposes
of our comparison procedures, we were instructed by the Company to use the logic enumerated in the applicable “Comparison
Instructions” Section of Exhibit 1. We make no representations regarding the methodologies or assumptions provided to us
by the Company.
 
For each Sample Attribute, for the purposes of our comparison
procedures, we were instructed by the Company to use the tolerance listed in Exhibit 1 as the maximum acceptable difference.
 
We compared and agreed the information and noted the
following differences (the “Initial
Discrepancies”):
 


Property ID

2.On the Initial Data Tape, we identified 125 Properties where the MTM? data element was equal to “Y.” Of
the 125 Properties, 31 of these properties (the “Initial Month to Month Sample”) were a sub-set of the Sample Properties.
Using the MTM Support File provided by the Company, the Initial Data Tape, and the methodology provided by the Company, we confirmed,
other than the exceptions noted in the table below, that the Initial Month to Month Sample Properties:
 

a.Had a Current Occupancy Status of “Occupied” within the Initial Data Tape,

b.Had a Date of Lease End date prior to the Property Cut-off Date and

c.As indicated in the MTM Support File, had posted a rental payment or a delinquent payment notice for September 2016.
 
We noted the following exceptions (the “Initial MTM Discrepancies”):

3.We noted that 1,271 properties of the Initial Sample Properties remained in the Final Data Tape (the “Sample Properties”).
For each of the Sample Properties, we performed the following procedures:
 

a)For each Sample Attribute relating to the Initial Discrepancies, we compared the “Source Document Value” shown
in the table in Procedure 1, to the related Sample Purchase Attribute, or Sample Lease Attribute value in the Final Data tape and
noted no differences.
 

b)For each Sample Attribute that did not have an Initial Discrepancy, we compared the Initial Data Tape and the Final Data Tape
and noted no differences.
 
We make no representations as to the adequacy of the sample size,
nor do we draw any conclusions about the entire Final Data Tape based on the sample size and results of the procedures performed.

4.On the Final Data Tape, we identified 111 Properties where the MTM? data element was equal to “Y.” Of the
111 Properties, 28 of these properties (the “Final Month to Month Sample”) were a sub-set of the Sample Properties.
Using the MTM Support File provided by the Company, the Final Data Tape, and the methodology provided by the Company, we noted
that the Final Month to Month Sample leases:
 

a.Had a Current Occupancy Status of “Occupied” within the Final Data Tape,

b.Had a Date of Lease End date prior to the Property Cut-off Date and

c.As indicated in the MTM Support File, had posted a rental payment or a delinquent payment notice for September 2016.
 
We noted no exceptions.
 

5.Using the information, instruction, and assumptions provided by the Company, for each of the Properties represented in the
Final Data Tape, we performed the respective procedures for the fields listed in Exhibit 2. The Company provided the Supplemental
Data Files and certain calculation methodologies as identified in Exhibit 2 for the purposes of comparing or recalculating each
characteristic and instructed us to use these methodologies for the purpose of our procedures. We make no representations regarding
the methodologies or assumptions provided to us by the Company.
 
We compared and agreed the information and noted no exceptions.
 
We make no representations regarding the methodologies or assumptions provided
to us by the Company.
 
Except as described below, we performed no procedures to determine the accuracy
or completeness of the information contained in the Data Files.
 
We were not engaged to, and did not conduct an examination
or review, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion on the Progress 2016-SFR2 Data Tape. 
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion.  Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might
have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.


The procedures enumerated above were performed as
of the date of this report, and we disclaim any consideration of any events and circumstances occurring after the date of this
report. Further, we have no obligation to update this report because of events occurring, or data or information coming to our
attention, subsequent to the date of this report.
