e.l.f. Beauty IPO Shines in Wall Street Debut | Fortune.comRetailSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantTarang Amin, center, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty Inc., rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to celebrate his company's IPO in New York City on September 22, 2016.   Brendan McDermid — Reuters cosmetics industrye.l.f. Beauty Sees Stock Soar 50% in Blockbuster IPOJohn KellSep 22, 2016They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Well, Wall Street investors love the look of e.l.f. Beauty—and they are clamoring to own a piece of the newly public cosmetics brand.Shares e.l.f. Beauty—only the third beauty products brand to launch an initial public offering in the past decade—soared more than 50% from the offering price of $17 to trade above $25 per share in Thursday afternoon trading. The debut is the first for a consumer sector brand since Amplify Snack Brands (betr) went public a little over a year ago with a disappointing debut.e.l.f. Beauty (the acronym stands for for eyes, lips and face) is aiming to tackle the $57 billion global cosmetics market with a sales pitch that it can tackle the white space between high-priced prestige brands and mass-market items that are less innovative. The company, which was founded in 2004 by father-son entrepreneurs Alan and Joey Shamah, says most of its items retail for $6 or less—allowing users an opportunity to try their beauty products with a low price barrier. A trio of eyeshadow items, for example, retail for $4 versus rival brands for as much as $28.The company says it has particularly strong appeal with millennials and Hispanics—two fast-growing demographic groups in terms of purchasing power in the U.S. Net sales soared from $83 million in 2012 to $191 million last year. e.l.f. Beauty is also profitable."e.l.f. Beauty's cosmetics were always focused on diverse consumers and millennials long before it was fashionable to do so," Chief Executive Tarang Amin told Fortune. "We don't believe women should have to pay high for luxurious beauty products. And we believe in serving all women."The company's 43% retail sales growth in 2015 is far faster than bigger, established brands like Revlon (rev), L'Oreal and Cover Girl. Albeit, e.l.f. Beauty only commands 2.3% of the $8 billion U.S. mass cosmetics market. That means sales growth will likely continue to look impressive—if the company is able to steal additional market share.Amin says e.l.f. Beauty differs from rivals because it doesn't rely on traditional big-budget ad campaigns and celebrity endorsements. Instead, it is rooted in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer relations through social media channels—essentially relying on loyal customers to spread the brand's word. It sells its products at around 19,000 retail stores in the U.S., with Walmart (wmt), Target (tgt) and CVS Health (cvs) among the largest customers.e.l.f. Beauty says it sees particularly strong demand from millennials and Hispanic shoppers. Courtesy of e.l.f. Beauty National and international retailers comprised 87% of e.l.f.'s total sales last year, with 13% coming form direct-to-consumer channels. Amin says that growth is balanced. The success at big retailers implies that e.l.f. could earn more additional shelf space down the road.The company is also opening its own stores. It has nine locations in the New York City metropolitan area and two in Los Angeles. Because it only began to open brick-and-mortar locations in 2013, that remains a somewhat untested aspect of the company's business—though also a possible opportunity.IPO ETF manager Renaissance Capital notes e.l.f. Beauty's IPO debut is stronger than the other two beauty products companies over the past decade. Though to be fair, Coty (coty)—which went public in 2013—is a far more established company in terms of size and growth potential. Coty ended its first day of trading down 0.8% but has since risen 36%. Physicians Formula raised $128 million in 2006 and popped 16%, but only sold for $75 million in 2012.The company has said that it will use the IPO proceeds to repay debt and for working capital purposes.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Style Scores:



F Value | C Growth | F Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 4,000,000 shares of common
stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $59.7 million
at the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering.

We currently expect to use $40.4 million of our net proceeds from this offering
to repay existing indebtedness, including a related pre-payment penalty of 1%,
and any proceeds remaining thereafter will be used for working capital and
general corporate purposes. The interest rates on our existing indebtedness
under the Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Term Loan were 6.25% and 11%,
respectively, as of June 30, 2016. The maturity date of each of the Term Loan
Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility is January 31, 2019, and the maturity
date of the Second Lien Term Loan is July 31, 2019. On June 7, 2016, we entered
into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility, pursuant to which we
incurred an additional $64.0 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan
Facility to fund, in part, the $72.0 million special dividend to stockholders.

Our management will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds
from this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities.


The cosmetics industry is relatively concentrated. In 2015, over 60% of
cosmetics retail sales in the United States were generated by brands owned by
L’Oreal S.A., The Estee Lauder Companies Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company,
Revlon Inc. and Shiseido Company, Limited. These large multinational companies
own many brands across mass and prestige cosmetics. Of the nearly 30 cosmetics
brands with retail sales exceeding $100 million in the United States in 2015,
e.l.f. is one of only four that are independent. In addition to the traditional
brands against which we compete, small independent companies continue to enter
the market with new brands and customized product offerings. At less than 1% of
total cosmetics retail sales, there is low private-label penetration in this
highly branded category.

Among other areas, we believe that we compete against other cosmetics brands on
price, quality of products and packaging, perceived value, innovation, in-store
presence and visibility, and e-commerce and mobile commerce initiatives.
e.l.f.’s share of the U.S. mass cosmetics market was 2.3% in 2015, ranking us as
the eighth largest mass cosmetics brand in the United States excluding brands
primarily focused on nails.


Company Description
We are one of the fastest growing, most innovative cosmetics companies in the
United States. Driven by our mission to make luxurious beauty accessible for all
women to play beautifully®, we have challenged the traditional belief that
quality cosmetics are only available at high prices in select


 channels. e.l.f.
offers high-quality, prestige-inspired beauty products for e yes, l ips and f 
ace at extraordinary value, with the majority of our items retailing for $6 or 
less. Our price points encourage trial and experimentation, while our commitment
to quality and a differentiated consumer engagement model engender loyalty among
a passionate and vocal group of consumers. We have built an authentic brand and 
a company with strong growth, margins and cash flow from operations.

We believe our success is rooted in our innovation process and ability to build
direct consumer relationships. Born as an e-commerce company over a decade ago,
we have created a modern consumer engagement and responsive innovation model
that keeps our products on-trend and our consumers engaged as brand ambassadors.
Our consumers provide us with real-time feedback through reviews and social
media, which enables us to refine and augment our product portfolio in response
to their needs. We leverage our fast-cycle product development and asset-light
supply chain to launch high-quality products in as few as 20 weeks from concept,
and 27 weeks on average. Our products are first launched on elfcosmetics.com,
and distribution is generally only broadened to our retail customers after we
receive strong consumer validation online. We believe this has led to our
consistently strong retail sales per linear foot of shelf space, which we refer
to as “productivity.” We are one of the fastest growing cosmetics brands at
Target, Walmart and CVS.

Our brand appeals to some of the most sought after consumers in the category. We
believe the combination of our affordable price points and on-trend, innovative
product assortment encourages trial, offers a strong value proposition and
appeals to a broad base of consumers. Relative to the overall cosmetics
category, our brand over-indexes with Millennials, multi-cultural consumers and
some of the heaviest users in the category. This attractive and loyal consumer
base supports high sales per linear foot and higher category sales for our
retail customers. By combining our strong relationships with leading retailers
with integrated consumer engagement across our e.l.f. stores, e-commerce and
social media, we are a true multi-channel brand.
---

We were incorporated in Delaware on December 20, 2013 under the name J.A.
Cosmetics Holdings, Inc. In April 2016, we changed our name to e.l.f. Beauty,
Inc. Our principal offices are located at 570 10th Street, Oakland, California
94607. Our telephone number is (510) 778-7787. We maintain a website at
www.elfcosmetics.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
