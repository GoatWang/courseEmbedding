It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Andrew’s Full ProfileSummaryI am a Brand Marketeer and Marketing Communications specialist with more than eleven years of experience in the sporting goods industry. My expertise includes the planning, development, production and execution of brand and product campaigns across all consumer touchpoints and communication channels. My objective has always been to emotionalize brands and create engaging brand experiences for consumers. I have achieved this for eight years at adidas through numerous global football campaigns (including the concepts for the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups) and a cross-divisonal brand image campaign. As Director Brand Communications & Advertising Racquet Sports at HEAD I shifted the company's communications strategy to a holistic, digital marketing approach, using social media to help re-position HEAD Tennis internally and externally as an emotional and consumer-focussed brand. My strengths are - in addition to creative brand leadership - my leadership, project management, communication and presentation skills. Recently I completed the Global Executive MBA programme at INSEAD, one of the world's leading business schools, to broaden my horizon, position myself for a general management role, complete a dedicated leadership development programme to become a better leader for others, and also myself, and build a wide, diverse network with business leaders around the globe. I am a passionate sports fan and tennis player, and I like to laugh and make others smile, according to my life motto: ‚Succeeding with a Smile‘.ExperienceBrand & Marketing Consultant to the CMO & Group Marketing TeamDouglas Cosmetics GmbhJanuary 2017  –  Present (7 months)Düsseldorf Area, GermanyInterim Head of Marketing - Deutsche Postcode LotterieNovamediaFebruary 2016  –  October 2016 (9 months)Düsseldorf Area, GermanyExternal Consultant for Brand Positioning & Marketing Communications StrategyTennis-Point GmbHApril 2015  –  May 2016 (1 year 2 months)Düsseldorf Area, GermanyDirector Advertising Racquet Sports & Brand CommunicationHEAD Sports GmbHMarch 2012  –  August 2013 (1 year 6 months)Head of International Advertising & Communication Racquet SportsHEAD Sports GmbHMay 2010  –  March 2012 (1 year 11 months)Senior Football Communication ManageradidasAugust 2007  –  April 2010 (2 years 9 months)Global Advertising ManageradidasAugust 2005  –  July 2007 (2 years)Amsterdam Area, NetherlandsCommunication Manager Football & RugbyadidasJuly 2003  –  July 2005 (2 years 1 month)SkillsIntegrated Brand MarketingStrategic MarketingAdvertisingSocial Media MarketingRetail MarketingDigital MarketingPublic RelationsTeam LeadershipSports MarketingCorporate IdentityMedia BuyingAgency Relationship ManagementBudget ManagementCorporate Social ResponsibilitySocial EntrepreneurshipSee 18+Creative WritingCreative BriefsSales Tools DevelopmentCatalogue ProductionEvent Planning and ManagementPublic SpeakingMarket ResearchMarketing CommunicationsMarketing StrategyIntegrated MarketingProject ManagementConsultingEvent PlanningMarketingBrand DevelopmentManagementSocial MediaStrategySee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationINSEADMaster of Business Administration (M.B.A.)Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)2013  –  2014James Madison University - College of BusinessBachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.)Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.)1999  –  2002PublicationsWestdeutsche ZeitungJune 2014Authors: Andrew LuxRemscheider General AnzeigerFebruary 2014Authors: Andrew LuxHonors & AwardsHEAD Lifetime Achievement Award for Marketing Communication ExcellenceHEAD Sports GmbHJune 2013James Madison University Outstanding Student in Marketing AwardJames Madison University College of BusinessMay 2002James Madison University Scholar-Athlete of the YearJames Madison University Athletics DivisionApril 2001European Tennis Champion Men's 35 DoublesInternational Tennis FederationJanuary 2015CoursesIndependent CourseworkEdward de Bono International Thinking CruiseEdward de Bono International Thinking CruiseEdward de Bono Six Thinking Hats – Creative Thinking & Team leadership seminarEdward de Bono Six Thinking Hats – Creative Thinking & Team leadership seminarTeamwork & Leadership Seminar, GRID-Institute for organizational developmentTeamwork & Leadership Seminar, GRID-Institute for organizational developmentOrganizationsOur Children and our Future e.V.Advisor & Social Media ManagerStarting November 2014http://www.our-children-and-our-future.de/Beta Gamma Sigma Honor SocietyMemberStarting January 2000Volunteer Experience & CausesAdvisory Board Member & Marketing and Social Media Manager  Our Children and Our Future e.V.November 2014  –  Present (2 years 9 months)ChildrenI am  supporting a project in Uganda, which is supported by a charitable organization in my home town in Germany.
