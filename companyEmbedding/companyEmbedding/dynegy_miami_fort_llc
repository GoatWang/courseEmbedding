What are Superfunds?
Superfund: A Superfund site is any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment.
NPL Superfund: The National Priorities List is a list of the most hazardous waste sites that have been identified by Superfund/ CERCLIS where long-term remedial response actions can only be conducted.The National Priorities List (NPL) is the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States eligible for long-term remedial action (cleanup) financed under the federal Superfund program. Congress created the Superfund in 1980 to pay for the cleanup of the country's most hazardous waste sites.
