To be valuable company for all of our stakeholders, we are committed to increasing not only our economical value but also increasing our social value.

“Clean up” Activities



 “Clean up” Activities 

 General Meeting 

The company headquarters is located near Ikebukuro Station, one of the largest and busiest stations in Tokyo. At Hikari Tsushin, about 10 volunteers of among our employees clean up the area within a radius of 300 meters from the station about three times a month. Cooperating with local communities, we engage in voluntary activities that are approved by the city hall.

Creating job opportunities in local towns

Jobs’ concentration in metropolitan areas aggravates the employment situation in some local towns in Japan. However, today’s advanced telecommunications technologies make it dispensable in certain cases to operate call centers in large cities where operating costs tend to be high. Hikari Tsushin is operating a number of call centers (as of March 2008) in such local towns to create job opportunities with Business Partners.

Environmental Activities
Challenge 25 Campaign





Hikari Tsushin is a member of Challenge 25 Campaign, a project run by the Ministry of the Environment. Hikari Tsushin is committed to action on global warming.


Transportation Policy

The Hikari Tsushin Group has more than 10,000 sales personnel, but sales activities are principally done on foot or using public transportation.

Trash Separation and Recycling

Hikari Tsushin trashes aluminum cans and steel cans separately, and gives them to recycling companies. Hikari Tsushin also requests recycling companies to collect paper used in its business operations.

Bottle Cap Collection for Vaccine Donations

Hikari Tsushin collects PET bottle caps in Hikari Center Building (The Hikari Tsushin Group’s head office). We donate them to a nonprofit organization (NPO) called the Ecocap Movement, which gives the proceeds to another NPO, Japan Committee Vaccines for World’s Children as funds for purchasing.

400 caps collected separately with bottles are equivalent to 10.
Poliovirus vaccines cost about 20 per child. (800 bottle caps)
400 bottle caps generate 3,150g of carbon dioxide when they are incinerated.


Poster display

Hikari Tsushin encourages awareness of environmental issues among all employees by posting signs encouraging them to save electricity and water.

Columbia Wanger Asset Management LLC

                                    Columbia Wanger Asset Management (CWAM) provides professional management of global equity assets using in-house resources to seek superior long term results. The firm follows a fundamental, research-intensive investment style characterized by unconventional stock picking and multi-year time horizon. They are the investment advisor to a variety of open-end mutual funds that are series or portfolios of Columbia Acorn Trust and Wanger Advisors Trust, two registered investment companies sponsored by CWAM.Columbia Acorn Fund, Columbia Acorn USA and Wanger USA (a variable annuity fund) are CWAM's domestic small-cap funds, which invest primarily in stocks of companies with market-caps of less than $5 billion at the time of initial purchase. Columbia Acorn International Fund and Wanger International (a variable annuity fund) are the firm's international small-cap funds, which primarily invest in stocks of companies with market-caps of less than $5 billion at the time of initial purchase. CWAM does not sell successful stocks solely because they have appreciated beyond an arbitrary capitalization limit. Their domestic mid-cap funds, Columbia Acorn Select and Wanger Select, invest in stocks of companies with market-caps less than $20 billion at the time of initial purchase. WAM's international mid-cap funds, Columbia Acorn International Select and Wanger International Select (a variable annuity fund), invest in stocks of companies with market-caps of $2 billion to $25 billion at the time of initial purchase. Columbia Acorn Emerging Markets Fund is their international emerging markets small-cap fund, which invests primarily in stocks of companies with market-caps of less than $5 billion at the time of initial purchase that are located in emerging market countries. Columbia Acorn European Fund is the firm's European small-cap fund, which invests primarily in stocks of companies with market-caps of less than $5 billion at the time of initial purchase that are located in a European country.CWAM's investment style can be best described as growth at a reasonable price (GARP). The firm seeks to buy growing, undervalued companies, grow with them, and sell them when their growth slows or when they believe they are fully valued. The firm is particularly interested in underfollowed stocks and niche companies. They like companies that benefit from long-term trends that CWAM identifies. The firm uses dividend discount, private market value and cash flow models to value stocks. CWAM especially likes companies with hidden values beyond reported EPS, such as unusually high free cash flow, masked earnings power or hidden assets. They usually avoid companies in highly competitive or unpredictable industries, such as airlines, commodity semiconductors and many natural resource areas.

Atlantis Investment Research Corp.

                                    AIR-JP is an active, GARP-oriented investment manager focused on long-term capital appreciation. The parent firm's investment philosophy emphasizes reactivity, regional specialization with in-depth knowledge of a specific market, as well as the freedom for portfolio managers to make decisions within their area of specialization, including capping the assets under management.AIR-JP invests in Japanese equity, equity-related instruments, high-grade bonds, money-market instruments and property-related listed securities. The firm follows a long-only strategy and implements a bottom-up investment process based on fundamental research, focusing on value, earnings growth, and management competence. They seek to identify undervalued companies with growth potential through the analysis of key ratios. They use macro-economic analysis to recognize factors likely to influence the growth of portfolio companies and investment prospects. AIR-JP's research process leverages a long-established network of local contacts, and includes an extensive program of company visits. Primary research is supplemented with outsourced sell-side analysis.AIR-JP invests across market caps, focusing on the small- to mid-cap segment where they seek opportunities to exploit market inefficiencies. They favor sectors such as machinery, retail, real estate and services. Investments are divested when earnings growth slackens, or when fundamentals change, or if a stock's market value has caught up with its estimated value.

The firm follows a fundamental, research-intensive investment style characterized by unconventional stock picking and multi-year time horizon.

Columbia Acorn International Fund and Wanger International (a variable annuity fund) are the firm's international small-cap funds, which primarily invest in stocks of companies with market-caps of less than $5 billion at the time of initial purchase. CWAM does not sell successful stocks solely because they have appreciated beyond an arbitrary capitalization limit. Their domestic mid-cap funds, Columbia Acorn Select and Wanger Select, invest in stocks of companies with market-caps less than $20 billion at the time of initial purchase. WAM's international mid-cap funds, Columbia Acorn International Select and Wanger International Select (a variable annuity fund), invest in stocks of companies with market-caps of $2 billion to $25 billion at the time of initial purchase.

The firm seeks to buy growing, undervalued companies, grow with them, and sell them when their growth slows or when they believe they are fully valued. The firm is particularly interested in underfollowed stocks and niche companies. They like companies that benefit from long-term trends that CWAM identifies. The firm uses dividend discount, private market value and cash flow models to value stocks. CWAM especially likes companies with hidden values beyond reported EPS, such as unusually high free cash flow, masked earnings power or hidden assets. They usually avoid companies in highly competitive or unpredictable industries, such as airlines, commodity semiconductors and many natural resource areas.
