Our public offering of 25,000,000 is being made on a self-underwritten basis:  
no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. 
The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 25,000,000 shares offered at a 
public offering price of $0.15 per share will vary depending upon the total 
number of shares sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to 
incur offering expenses estimated at $16,899 for legal, accounting, printing 
and other costs in connection with this offering. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. We will not 
maintain an escrow account for the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our 
shares. 

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds from the primary offering 
would be used assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of 
the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we 
will raise the full $3,750,000 as anticipated.

The above figures represent only estimated costs.  All proceeds will be
deposited into our corporate bank account. Any funds that we raise from our
offering of 25,000,000 shares will be deposited in a Company bank account in the
United States immediately available for our use and will not be returned to
investors. We do not have any arrangements to place the funds received from our
offering of $3,750,000 in an escrow, trust or similar account. Accordingly, if
we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is
filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy
estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws.  If a creditor sues us
and obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account
and take possession of the subscriptions.  As such, it is possible that a
creditor could attach your subscription which could preclude or delay the return
of money to you.  If that happens, you will lose your investment and your funds
will be used to pay creditors.


The social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times,
subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends.
Competition is generally a function of the website’s brand strength and the
success of its marketing strategies, its user capacity and reliability, and its
ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features (such as
smart-phone or Twitter compatibility, for example). Additionally, with regard to
the online retail component of our business, competition is generally a function
of the assortment and continuity of merchandise selection offered, reliable
order fulfillment and delivery, and the level of brand support for products
offered.

We will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking
and merchandising websites, many of which have significantly greater resources
than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market
products and services similar to (and competitive with) our products and
services. Specifically, we compete with the major niche social networking
websites such as Facebook and Twitter. We also compete with several smaller
niche social websites brands such as sosyalan.com, risingstars.ph and
greatpinoy.com. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the
industry, as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from
our business operations.

Management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a
price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access to our website,
and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium package services.
Initially, general subscriptions to our site will be free and premium package
subscriptions will be only approximately $9.99 per month. We will also seek to
differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive social
network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate with each
other.


Company Description
Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. is a development stage company. We were 
incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 12, 2010, and 
are engaged in the development of a social networking website, 
www.kababayanko.com, for overseas workers from the Philippines and others who


 
share or are interested in their lifestyle. Our fiscal year end is 
December 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our social networking website aims 
to provide overseas workers from the Philippines with a platform to share 
their overseas working and living experiences, and interact with a community 
of Filipino overseas workers from around the world. 

From our incorporation on August 12, 2010, until December 28, 2011, we were a 
“blank check” company under the securities laws, meaning that our sole 
business plan was to merge with or be acquired by an operating business. On 
December 28, 2011, we merged with Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc., 
effecting the acquisition of our current business and changed our name from 
“Daedalus Ventures, Inc.” to “Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. Since 
March 2011 we have been developing our social networking website for overseas 
workers from the Philippines, www.kababayanko.com. Our website is currently in 
the development stage. We expect our website to be ready for public launch 
within 6 months following successful completion of this Offering, provided 
that we have correctly estimated the funds required to execute our business 
plan. If we are successful in completing and launching our website, we 
anticipate that we will generate nominal revenues within 4 to 6 months 
following the website launch. 

-----

Our business offices are currently located at 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, 
Riverside, California 92505. Our telephone number is (888) 770-5084. We have a 
website located at www.kababayanko.com.
