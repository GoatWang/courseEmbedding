Variable Annuities Overview    
At Prudential Annuities, we understand that every retirement investor has different goals, risk tolerances, and time horizons. That’s why we created a range of solutions that combine the best features of traditional variable annuities, along with innovative new ideas, to offer more control and more opportunities for growth. 


Please work with a financial advisor to help determine a suitable option for your specific needs.

What are your goals?




Predictable income without
 investing in stocks

 


Prudential

Defined Income

Variable Annuity



This unique variable annuity can tell you exactly what your income will be, now or at any point in the future. And that income is guaranteed for life, without stock market exposure.








Help increase and
 protect retirement income
 





Prudential

Highest Daily
Lifetime® Income

Variable Annuity


This optional benefit, available on Prudential Premier Retirement Variable Annuities, can help increase income for retirement, help protect it from downturns, and guarantee it lasts a lifetime.








More efficient
 investment growth
 



Prudential

Premier Investment

Variable Annuity



This variable annuity provides a diversified range of investments, a pro-growth fee structure, and tax advantages that can help your money grow more efficiently.
















Highest Daily Lifetime Income may be a good fit if you seek to: 


Increase retirement income by locking in* new account highs daily AND immediately growing those highs at a compounded rate for retirement purposes. (Note: daily compounded growth continues for the first 10 years or until first withdrawal, whichever comes first)
 *Please note lock-ins do not apply to the account value. The account value is not guaranteed, can fluctuate, and may lose value.
Protect income through downturns
Gain access to a wide range of professionally managed investment portfolios
Provide a legacy for beneficiaries with standard and enhanced death benefit options


Prudential Defined Income may be a good fit if you seek to: 


Enjoy the predictability of knowing, on day one of your contract, exactly how much your lifetime income will be, whether you start taking it immediately, or later
Aims to provide a higher level of minimum guaranteed income – at lower cost – than generally found with most other VAs with living benefits.
Grow lifetime income at a guaranteed growth rate until the first withdrawal is taken
Protect income through interest rate and other market fluctuations
Provide a guaranteed death benefit for beneficiaries


The Premier® Investment VA may be a good fit if you seek to: 


Help increase investment growth by deferring taxes until you start taking withdrawals
Rebalance investments without triggering annual taxes
Create a diversified portfolio to help reduce volatility and potentially help performance over time
Access leading brand name and boutique investment firms through a variety of investment strategies
Provide a legacy for loved ones with an optional Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, which is available for a fee







Ready to move forward?
Contact your financial advisor. He or she can help decide which annuity is right for you.

















What is a Variable Annuity? 
A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long-term investment designed for retirement purposes. You place money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax-deferred. When you retire, your savings can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. A financial professional can help you determine if a variable annuity is suitable for you.

Why the company behind the annuity matters. 
All references to income certainty and guarantees, including the benefit payment obligations arising under the annuity contract guarantees, rider guarantees, benefits, or annuity payout rates are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Those payments and the responsibility to make them are not the obligations of the third party broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased or any of its affiliates. They are also not obligations of any affiliates of the issuing insurance company. All guarantees, including benefits, do not apply to the underlying investment options.

What are the limitations and restrictions I need to consider? 
Annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force. The optional benefits have certain investment, holding period, liquidity, and withdrawal limitations and restrictions. Optional living and death benefits may not be available in every state and may not be elected in conjunction with certain optional benefits. Please see the prospectus or ask your advisor for more information.

Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market. Prudential Annuities is not providing investment advice. Selections are dependent on the risk tolerance and investment goals of the customer. 

For the Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity, the optional Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit may not be available in every state and has certain investment restrictions. Fees charged for the death benefit are in addition to fees and charges associated with the basic annuity. Please see the prospectus for more information. 
Issued on Riders: P-RID-ROP(5/14), P-RID-ROP(5/14)-NY et al. or any state variation thereof.

Prudential Annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant. 

What are the withdrawal consequences? 
Since the annuity is designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement, there are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals that are not intended for retirement income purposes. For the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit and the Prudential Defined Income VA, withdrawals in excess of the income amount impact the value of a product or benefit. An excess withdrawal occurs when your cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals exceed the income amount in any annuity year. If an excess withdrawal is taken, only the portion of the Lifetime Withdrawal that exceeds the remaining income amount for that year will proportionally and permanently reduce future guaranteed amounts. If a withdrawal reduces the account value to zero, no further amount would be payable and the contract terminates. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty, sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals, other than from IRAs or employer retirement plans, are deemed to be gains out first for tax purposes. Withdrawals reduce the account value, death benefits, and the annual amount of living and/or death benefits available.

What are the costs associated with the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit and the Variable Annuity? 
Variable annuities offered by Prudential companies have an annual cost of 0.55% to 1.95% for mortality expense and administration fees, with an additional fee related to the professional investment options. The fees will vary depending on the underlying annuity and investment options selected. The optional benefit, HD Lifetime Income, has an additional annual fee of 1.00% based on the greater of two amounts, the Account Value or Protected Withdrawal Value.
The Protected Withdrawal Value is only used to calculate the guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit. It is separate from the account value, and not available as a lump sum withdrawal. Account value is not guaranteed, is subject to market fluctuations, and may lose value.

What happens to my Account Value during volatile market situations? 
The Highest Daily Lifetime Income v3.0 suite of benefits uses a predetermined mathematical formula to help us mitigate some of the financial risks we incur in providing the guarantees under this benefit through all market cycles. Each business day, the formula determines if any portion of your account value in the permitted subaccounts (asset allocation portfolios), including any Dollar Cost Averaging Market Value Adjusted options needs to be automatically transferred into or out of the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio (the "Bond Portfolio"). Amounts transferred by the formula depend on a number of factors unique to your individual annuity and include:      


The difference between the account value and the Protected Withdrawal Value;     
How long you have owned the benefit;     
The amount invested in, and the performance of, the permitted subaccounts, the Bond Portfolio, and the Secure Value Account (SVA); and     
The impact of additional purchase payments made to and withdrawals taken from the annuity.


The formula will not transfer amounts to or from the Secure Value Account (SVA). On any given day, no more than 30% of the account value in the permitted subaccounts (plus any DCA MVA options) may be transferred to the Bond Portfolio pursuant to the formula. Therefore, at any given time, some, most, or none of the account value may be allocated to the Bond Portfolio. Transfers to and from the Bond Portfolio do not impact any income guarantees that have already been locked in. You may not allocate purchase payments or transfer account value into or out of the Bond Portfolio.

The formula could mean that you miss opportunities for investment gains in the permitted subaccounts while amounts are allocated to the Bond Portfolio. The formula's allocation of amounts to the Bond Portfolio, however, could also protect your account value from losses that may occur in the permitted subaccounts. Please note: We are not providing investment advice through the formula. See the prospectus for complete details.

We will automatically allocate 10% of each purchase payment to the SVA. You cannot make transfers into or out of the SVA. The SVA will earn interest daily at a crediting rate declared annually.

What do I need to consider when investing in a VA with the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit? 
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity-related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount’s share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase. Diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.

Certain portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments.

Issued on Riders: P-RID-HD(2/14), P-RID-HD-HDB (2/14), et al. or state variation thereof.



What are the costs associated with the Prudential Defined Income Variable Annuity?
The annual fee for the Prudential Defined Income VA is 1.10%, plus an additional benefit fee of 0.80% for a total annual product charge of 1.90%. We reserve the right to increase the benefit fee up to a maximum of 1.50% at any time on or after the 7th annuity anniversary on existing contracts. This would increase the total annual product charge to a maximum of 2.60%. Note: There is also an additional fee for the AST Multi-Sector Fixed Income Portfolio. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
What do I need to consider when investing in the Prudential Defined Income VA?
Fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase.
An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity or debt securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate over time. ETFs that offer leverage or that are designed to perform inversely to the index or benchmark they track (or both) are highly complex financial instruments that are typically designed to achieve their objectives on a daily basis. Due to the effects of compounding, their performance over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the performance (or inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark.
Issued on Contracts: P-BBND(2/13), P-RID-LI-DB (3/13) et al. or state variation thereof.
What do I need to understand about the Prudential Premier Investment asset allocation portfolios?
The Prudential Premier® Investment Variable Annuity offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying Portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer. Those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula (the “formula”) to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits. You should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in large-scale asset flows into and out of the underlying Portfolios through a series of transfers. In addition to increasing the Portfolios' expenses, the asset flows may adversely affect performance by (i) requiring the Portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times; (ii) otherwise limiting the sub-adviser's ability to fully implement the Portfolios' investment strategies; or (iii) requiring the Portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities that they otherwise would hold.
Before you allocate to these subaccounts, you should consider the impact the formula will have on each Portfolio's risk profile, expenses and performance. Please see the Prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which Portfolios are appropriate for you.
What are the costs associated with the Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity?
Variable annuities offered by Prudential Financial companies are available at a total annual insurance cost of 0.55% to 1.95%, with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment options. Note: All products may not be available through all third party broker/dealers. Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit is available for an additional annual fee of 0.30%. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Both the Total Insurance Charge and the Optional Death Benefit Charge are comprised of an account value-based charge and a premium-based charge. Account value-based charges are assessed daily based on an annualized rate charged against the assets allocated to the subaccounts. Premium-based charges are assessed quarterly against the Charge Basis (please see the section of the prospectus called "Fees, Charges and Deductions" for information on the Charge Basis) and are taken pro-rata from the subaccounts.
While most traditional VAs assess insurance charges daily based on account value, the insurance charge for the Premier Investment VA is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals). When we refer to the “pro-growth” charge structure, we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional VAs, any growth in your client’s account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value (a lower “effective charge”). This is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant. Conversely, if your client’s account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals), this would result in a higher effective charge.
What do I need to consider when investing in the Prudential Premier Investment VA?
If you purchase the Prudential Premier® Investment Variable Annuity within a tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as an IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, 401(a) plan, or non-ERISA 403(b) plan, you will get no additional tax advantage through the Annuity itself. Because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans, the reasons for purchasing the Annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, the opportunity to annuitize the contract, and the various investment options, which might make the Annuity an appropriate investment for you. You should consult your tax and financial advisors regarding such features and benefits prior to purchasing this Annuity for use with a tax-qualified plan.
Issued on Contracts: P-OB/IND(5/14), P-OC/IND(5/14) et al. or state variation thereof.

We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.

Back to topProduct Agreement BasicsBuying and selling are the basis of business, but in the rush to complete a transaction, it's sometimes easy to skip the details. Writing up a solid Product Agreement may actually save you money down the road. It's smart to get a written quote up front. In a Product Agreement, you can describe the items in detail and include quality standards that the seller must meet. You can specify when and where your items will be delivered. What happens if the goods don't arrive, or come late? Or what if you don't get paid for the products? Or if the price suddenly changes? You might not realize you don't have anything beyond a verbal agreement until it's too late. Customers might be counting on you having products on a certain date. You might have even accepted backorders. Or maybe you run a small business and getting paid on time means your mortgage gets paid. A Product Agreement can help keep you in the clear.

Back to topPromissory Note with Installment Payments BasicsLoans can be structured in a number of ways, but a Promissory Note with Installment Payments helps keep things easy. Whether you're the lender or the borrower, you know exactly what each payment will be. Interest rates are easily calculated and all the terms and obligations are clearly spelled out. The exact same payments will be made until the loan is repaid, and the payment schedule is laid out. Loans don't have to be complicated, if you'd prefer to keep things simple then installments can be a great choice. As a lender, how your loans are designed is up to you, but it's still a good idea to have the details in writing. Using a Promissory Note with Installment Payments is one way to keep the loan process simple.
