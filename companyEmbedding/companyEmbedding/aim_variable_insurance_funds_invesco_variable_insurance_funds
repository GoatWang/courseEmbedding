		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


		
		They do not reflect sales charges, expenses and fees at the separate account level.  These sales charges, expenses and fees, which are determined by the product issuers, will vary and will lower the total return.


Series I and II may not be available in all products. Please check the product prospectus for more information.


Consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully. For product and underlying funds prospectuses containing this and other information for any variable annuity or variable life product that invests in the Invesco variable insurance funds, contact the offering insurance company. Not all funds and classes are available in all products. Investors should read the prospectuses carefully before investing.


		
		You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


		
		Effective April 29, 2016, the Invesco V.I. Money Market Fund was renamed the Invesco V.I. Government Money Market Fund and its investment strategy changed from a prime to a government money market fund.
