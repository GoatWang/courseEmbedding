Web Check-In - The Inside Scoop










 


Should You Check-In Online or At the Airport?



Other advantages include:

In addition to being able to hold on to your seat, on-line check-in gives you more flexibility in seat assignments. The week prior to departure is often full of seat changes, as travelers move around the plane getting upgraded and finding the best seats. At the twenty four hour window, better seats can also open up.  
Printing your boarding pass ahead of time, of course, saves time. But if you don’t have a printer, you can show an airline agent at the airport your ID and they’ll print it out for you. Some airlines offer the option of downloading your boarding pass to a mobile device or a self-service kiosk to print it out.  
Some airlines offer bonus frequent flyer miles for Web check-in.
Web Check-in is a service that allows you to check in for your flight from anywhere there’s an Internet connection. In most cases, you can select your seats and check in from 24 hours up until 2 hours before your flight. And if your itinerary includes a connection to a carrier that the airline has an e-ticketing and online check-in agreement with, you may check in for your flights with those carriers as well.
The majority of sizeable domestic airlines offer Web Check-in, including Delta, United, US Airways, American, Northwest, Continental, Alaska,  Jet Blue and Southwest. Some major international airlines also feature Web Check-in, including Air Canada, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. However, not all international airlines have adopted the system.
While checking in online is a great time saver, like so many online exchanges, there are drawbacks. It’s a good idea to be aware of both the pros and the cons before you take the Web Check-in plunge.

Have a tip to share?Email us at hello@egencia.com.
What’s so great about it?
One of the best things about Web Check-in is that you can arrive at the airport much closer to take-off. You just need to be at the gate by the time the door is closed, 20 to 25 minutes before departure. Typically, those who are last to check in at the airport are the first to get bumped if the flight is overbooked. However, with online check-in you can lose your keys, forget your wallet, drive back home to retrieve it, get stuck in traffic, arrive at the airport just in the nick of time, and your seat still won’t be given away. Even if you don't make it at all,  your seat will be held until the last possible moment. Only if you haven't showed up at that point and the spare seats are needed will the airline give away your seat. 
Okay, so what’s not so great?
While some people have concerns about how or when they're going to check their luggage in and are worried about its integration into the system when they check-in online, that really is a non-issue. The biggest restriction is that once you check in, you cannot make any changes to your reservation. So, if your plans could change online check-in is not a good fit for your travel plans. Once you check-in, an airline imposed change fee will be applied. You'll also need to call an Egencia Travel Agent to contact the airline for you and cancel the check in. 
Additionally, you may not be eligible to use Online Flight Check-In if you are:

traveling on a military fare 
traveling with a pet
traveling with an oxygen container 
traveling with an infant under the age of two
An unaccompanied minor


About  the Author
Jennifer  Carrara is a writer for Egencia. Her background includes positions as an  advertising copywriter, marketing writer, and magazine editor. Currently she  writes proposals, answering every question in the book about the value of a  travel management partner – from how to redeem an unused airline ticket, to  configuring a global travel program.




If you travel with only carry-on luggage, boarding is further streamlined. But even if you need to check your bags, most carriers have separate lines at ticketing for "full" versus "luggage only" check-in. The "luggage only" line always moves faster because all you have to do is scan your boarding pass, drop off your bags and head through security. 

Things to Keep in Mind when you Check-in

Web Check-in is not available on all itineraries, and it isn't always perfectly clear which those might be, as they vary by airline and international law. Most airline Web sites maintain a FAQ list clearly outlining policies and restrictions.  
When traveling multiple leg trips on a single itinerary, you will be prompted to print individual boarding passes for each leg.

To Check-in Online, or Not, that is the Question
If your itinerary is complex, you might be better off checking in at the airport. But if your travel plans are straightforward, checking in online is a simple procedure that you would do well to adopt.  Not only will you save time, but you will not contribute to the long lines and subsequent long wait that other travelers who need extra assistance must endure. All in all, Web Check-in is a great choice for the Web savvy traveler.

Pros of Web Check-In:Saves time - you can arrive at the airport closer to take-off Less likely to get bumped - your seat will be held until the last possible momentMore flexibility with seat assignmentsBonus frequent flyer points with some airlinesCons of Web Check-In:You can no longer change your flight  without a change fee - you essentially cash in your ticket when you check-in onlineNot all itineraries will be eligible for online check-in, varies based on airline's policy and complexity of trip

You will not be able to check-in online for your return trip at the same time you check-in for your outbound flight unless your return flight is within 24 hours of departure. 
It’s a good idea to have more than one contact phone number, and a contact phone number for the destination you are at in case of a delay or cancellation for your return flight. Otherwise, the airline has no way to contact you. 
Rules on how long in advance of your flight you can check in vary considerably. Some airlines allow passengers to check-in online within 12-24 hours of departure time to as late as 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Others require that check-in occur on the actual day of travel, meaning after 12:01AM on the day of travel, and these airlines may stop accepting online check-ins at 60 to 180 minutes before flight time. Since international travel generally requires that you arrive at your gate earlier than domestic travel, check-in deadlines are often earlier online as well.

Pros of Web Check-In:Saves time - you can arrive at the airport closer to take-off Less likely to get bumped - your seat will be held until the last possible momentMore flexibility with seat assignmentsBonus frequent flyer points with some airlinesCons of Web Check-In:You can no longer change your flight  without a change fee - you essentially cash in your ticket when you check-in onlineNot all itineraries will be eligible for online check-in, varies based on airline's policy and complexity of trip

You will not be able to check-in online for your return trip at the same time you check-in for your outbound flight unless your return flight is within 24 hours of departure. 
It’s a good idea to have more than one contact phone number, and a contact phone number for the destination you are at in case of a delay or cancellation for your return flight. Otherwise, the airline has no way to contact you. 
Rules on how long in advance of your flight you can check in vary considerably. Some airlines allow passengers to check-in online within 12-24 hours of departure time to as late as 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Others require that check-in occur on the actual day of travel, meaning after 12:01AM on the day of travel, and these airlines may stop accepting online check-ins at 60 to 180 minutes before flight time. Since international travel generally requires that you arrive at your gate earlier than domestic travel, check-in deadlines are often earlier online as well.

Give travelers what they want
You can achieve significant savings by driving compliance without mandates through a consumer centric experience. We provide convenience, comfort, and safety without sacrificing choice.

Learn more



Balance cost and compliance
We know it isn’t easy, but true cost savings in a travel management program comes from traveler adoption, not pure cost-cutting. To build a great program, you must start with the traveler’s need for familiar process, clear policy, and choice. Only then, can you benefit from how traveler adoption reduces cost.

Learn more



Tackle savings one by one
Measure the effectiveness of your travel policy. Dig into purchase trends and patterns. We can help you to identify new savings opportunities with your corporate travel program.

Learn more



Proactively manage risk
Travel risk can be mitigated with the right preparation. Assess, Inform and Assist should be your guiding principles. We can help you get your travel risk management on track.

Learn more



Keep it simple
Your travelers need three things: an online travel booking tool, mobile apps, and travel consultants on call in case of an emergency. Keep your corporate travel policy, fares, and content consistent across all touch points.

BELLEVUE, Wash., Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Egencia®, the business travel company of Expedia, Inc., plans to launch a suite of expense management products for the modern business traveler. After revolutionizing the booking experience through technology, Egencia is bringing this innovative spirit to the world of expense management.








"Egencia is taking a new approach to expense management," says Rob Greyber, President Egencia. "Working together with forward-thinking partners, who value innovation like we do, we can deliver an open, intuitive solution to the industry and business travelers.  That's the future.  That's our goal.  That's business travel (and expense) for the Expedia generation."
The Egencia expense management suite will consist of: 

Egencia Open Sync. Through this new Egencia product, travelers will be able to consolidate receipts and credit card transactions directly in Egencia, and then feed them in one-click into their expense system. This product is currently in beta and will be piloted with a select group of customers and expense partners in the coming weeks. 
Egencia Open Connect Platform. This platform is based today on a powerful set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that feed an ecosystem of Travel and Expense, Traveler Risk Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning partners. Egencia is extending this reporting and data management infrastructure with enhanced functionality; including the ability to extend the platform to new partners. 
Egencia Integrated Travel and Expense. Egencia will expand its offering to provide a fully integrated travel and expense management solution to create an end-to-end experience that captures booking, fulfilment and expense.  Egencia's first fully integrated expense management partner will be its affiliate Traveldoo, with other expense providers to follow.

Egencia LLC Terms of Use 

Last Revised on February 19, 2016
Welcome to the Egencia LLC website (the “Website”). This Website is provided solely to assist companies who subscribe to the Egencia service (each, a “Company”) to manage their business travel needs, including gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations for themselves or on behalf of others or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes.
The terms “we”, “us”, “our”, and “Egencia” refer to Egencia LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company, and its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, including Travelscape, LLC (collectively, the “Egencia Companies”). The term “you” refers to any employee of a Company visiting the Website, booking a reservation through this Website, and/or booking a reservation through Egencia agents.
This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance, without modification, of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) and your compliance with the terms set forth in your Company’s subscription agreement pursuant to travel services obtained through this Website. Please read the Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on the Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.
USE OF THE WEBSITE
As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that:

you are at least 18 years of age;
you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation;
you will use this Website in accordance with the Terms of Use;
you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for yourself or on behalf of those parties within your Company for whom you are legally authorized to act;
all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and
you will safeguard your Egencia account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you.

To the extent that you are making travel reservations on behalf of another employee of your Company (e.g., as a travel manager, assistant or other representative), you represent and warrant that such employee agrees to and is bound by these Terms of Use. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of the Terms of Use.

DISPUTES
Expedia is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns.  But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Expedia Customer Support at https://www.expedia.com/service/ or 1-877-787-7186.  If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify.  This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement).  This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would.
Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, except as provided in this section.  If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees.  You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004.  If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA’s rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.  An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.
PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES
The content and information on this Website (including, but not limited to, price and availability of travel services), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and information, is proprietary to us or our suppliers and providers or to your Company, or to those suppliers with whom your Company may have contracted directly with for travel services. While you may make limited copies of your travel itinerary (and related documents) for travel or service reservations booked through this Website, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any information, software, products, or services obtained from or through this Website. Additionally, you agree not to:

use this Website or its contents for any commercial purpose;
make any speculative, false, or fraudulent reservation or any reservation in anticipation of demand;
access, monitor or copy any content or information of this Website using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means or any manual process for any purpose without our express written permission;
violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on this Website or bypass or circumvent other measures employed to prevent or limit access to this Website;
take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
deep-link to any portion of this Website (including, without limitation, the purchase path for any travel services) for any purpose without our express written permission; or
“frame”, “mirror” or otherwise incorporate any part of this Website into any other website without our prior written authorization.

If your booking or account shows signs of fraud, abuse or suspicious activity, Egencia may cancel any travel or service reservations associated with your name, email address or account, and close any associated Egencia accounts. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, Egencia reserves the right to take any necessary legal action and you may be liable for monetary losses to Egencia, including litigation costs and damages. To contest the cancellation of a booking or freezing or closure of an account, please contact Egencia Customer Service

SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS
Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related goods and services that you select. Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully. In particular, if you have purchased an airfare, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the Supplier, which can be found on the Supplier’s website. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the supplier’s rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services. Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and other travel suppliers may change their prices without notice. We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion.
Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in five years’ imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples: Paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radio-pharmaceuticals.   There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried on your person.
Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by Egencia for your hotel booking. Egencia is not liable for any costs incurred due to relocation. You acknowledge that some third-party providers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier’s rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.

CORPORATE TRAVEL POLICIES
Your Company may provide Egencia LLC with its applicable travel policies (“Corporate Travel Policies”). We will assist your Company to apply the terms and conditions of its Corporate Travel Policies when transacting business with you. If you have any questions regarding the rules and regulations of your Corporate Travel Policy, please contact your Company directly for clarification.

PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONS
You acknowledge that Egencia LLC and its respective subsidiaries and corporate affiliates (collectively, the “Egencia Companies”) pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the Egencia Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the “facilitation fee”). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the Egencia Companies and the facilitation fee retained by us for our services. You authorize the Egencia Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees and where applicable, taxes on our services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by us for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the Egencia Companies, including Travelscape, LLC, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.
You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, we do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that are paid to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel’s rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice us for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the Egencia Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer’s travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by us for our services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.
You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation. You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms of Use imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.
Sales, use, and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (facilitation fee and/or service fee) in certain jurisdictions. For hotel stays in New York State, but outside of New York City, for example, tax recovery charges as described above are collected to cover the taxes due on the rent received by the hotel supplier for the room and there is no local hotel occupancy tax on our services. The actual tax amounts paid by us to taxing authorities on our services may vary from the tax amounts charged depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of hotel by our customers.

INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. Egencia has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.
Passport and Visa: You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for this information. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.
Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip.
Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft’s interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not on board. For more information, see: http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm
