SUNRISE, Fla., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Federated National Holding Company (Nasdaq:FNHC), a Florida-based provider of insurance, today announced that it plans to hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Tuesday, September 12, 2017 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Sunrise - Sawgrass Mills, located at 13400 West Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida 33323.  Shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 13, 2017 will be eligible to vote at the meeting.  The Company will mail and provide access to its definitive proxy materials to its shareholders prior to the Annual Meeting.
About the Company
The Company is authorized to underwrite, and/or place through our wholly owned subsidiaries, homeowners' multi-peril ("homeowners"), commercial general liability, federal flood, personal auto and various other lines of insurance in Florida and various other states.  The Company also serves as managing general agent for its joint venture, Monarch National Insurance Company.  The Company markets and distributes its own and third-party insurers' products and our other services through a network of independent agents. The Company also utilizes a select number of general agents for the same purpose.
Forward-Looking Statements /Safe Harbor Statements

Safe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:


Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "envision," "estimate," "expect," "guidance," "indicate," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "possibly," "potential," "predict," "probably," "pro-forma," "project," "seek," "should," "target," or "will" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon and similar words or phrases or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


Forward-looking statements might also include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:



Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, dividends, capital structure or other financial items or measures;


Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, insurance products/or services; 


Forecasts of future insurable events, economic performance, liquidity, need for funding and income; and


Descriptions of assumptions or estimates underlying or relating to any of the foregoing.



The risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally; the nature of the Company's business; the adequacy of its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense; claims experience; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and hail) and other catastrophic losses; reinsurance costs and the ability of reinsurers to indemnify the Company; raising additional capital and our potential failure to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements; potential assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations; the effectiveness of internal financial controls; the effectiveness of our underwriting, pricing and related loss limitation methods; changes in loss trends, including as a result of insureds' assignment of benefits; court decisions and trends in litigation; our potential failure to pay claims accurately; ability to obtain regulatory approval applications for requested rate increases, or to underwrite in additional jurisdictions, and the timing thereof; the impact that the results of the Monarch joint venture may have on our results of operations; inflation and other changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); pricing competition and other initiatives by competitors; legislative and regulatory developments; the outcome of litigation pending against the Company, and any settlement thereof; dependence on investment income and the composition of the Company's investment portfolio; insurance agents; ratings by industry services; the reliability of our information technology systems; reliance on key personnel; acts of war and terrorist activities; and other matters described from time to time by the Company in releases and publications, and in periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.


In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including claims and litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a contingency. Reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.


Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

Forward-Looking Statements /Safe Harbor Statements
Safe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "envision," "estimate," "expect," "guidance," "indicate," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "possibly," "potential," "predict," "probably," "pro-forma," "project," "seek," "should," "target," or "will" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon and similar words or phrases or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements might also include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, dividends, capital structure or other financial items or measures;
Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, insurance products/or services; 
Forecasts of future insurable events, economic performance, liquidity, need for funding and income; and
Descriptions of assumptions or estimates underlying or relating to any of the foregoing.

 The risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally; the nature of the Company's business; the adequacy of its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense; claims experience; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and hail) and other catastrophic losses; reinsurance costs and the ability of reinsurers to indemnify the Company; raising additional capital and our potential failure to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements; potential assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations; the effectiveness of internal financial controls; the effectiveness of our underwriting, pricing and related loss limitation methods; changes in loss trends, including as a result of insureds' assignment of benefits; court decisions and trends in litigation; our potential failure to pay claims accurately; ability to obtain regulatory approval applications for requested rate increases, or to underwrite in additional jurisdictions, and the timing thereof; the impact that the results of the Monarch joint venture may have on our results of operations; inflation and other changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); pricing competition and other initiatives by competitors; legislative and regulatory developments; the outcome of litigation pending against the Company, and any settlement thereof; dependence on investment income and the composition of the Company's investment portfolio; insurance agents; ratings by industry services; the reliability of our information technology systems; reliance on key personnel; acts of war and terrorist activities; and other matters described from time to time by the Company in releases and publications, and in periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.   In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including claims and litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a contingency. Reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal

           Year.




The Company's shareholders approved at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the
"Articles of Incorporation") and the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the
"Bylaws") eliminating supermajority voting provisions and reducing the
percentage of outstanding shares required to call a special meeting.  The
Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws have been amended to incorporate
these approved changes as described below.
The following sections of the Company's Articles of Incorporation have been
amended to reduce the affirmative vote required to adopt, amend or repeal any of
these provisions to a majority of the shares outstanding from 66-2/3%.
 • Article V (Directors)
 • Article VII (Special meetings of shareholders)
 • Article VIII (No shareholder action without a meeting)



 • Article X (Bylaws)



In the Bylaws, the related provisions that have been amended accordingly are:
 • Article II, Section 2 (Who can call special meetings of shareholders)
 • Article II, Section 9 (No action by shareholders without a meeting)
 • Article II, Section 10 (Advance notice of the intention to make a proposal at
   the meeting)
 • Article III (Directors)
 • Article X (Amendments to the Bylaws)
Also at the 2016 Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders approved amendments
to the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to reduce the percentage
of outstanding shares required to call a special meeting, from 33% to 25% of the
outstanding shares.  The approved amendments to the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws also expand the persons who may call a special meeting to include one
or more shareholders holding, in the aggregate, a "net long position" (as
defined below) in shares representing at least 25% of the outstanding shares. A
shareholder's "net long position" is generally defined as the number of shares
of common stock in which the shareholder holds a positive (also known as "long")
economic interest, reduced by the number of shares of common stock in which the
shareholder holds a negative (also known as "short") economic interest.
The Bylaws, as amended, impose certain procedural requirements on shareholders
requesting a special meeting (including the provision of the same information
required for shareholder proposals at annual meetings under the Company's
advance notice Bylaw provisions). The Bylaw amendments also impose
qualifications designed to prevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings by
eliminating proposals that, as determined by the Board:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· are not proper subjects for shareholder action under, or involve a violation
  of, applicable law;
· are received during the period beginning 120 days prior to the anniversary of
  the prior annual meeting of shareholders and ending on the date of the next
  annual meeting of shareholders;



· are substantially similar to another proposal, other than the election or
  removal of directors, that was presented at a meeting of shareholders held
  within the prior 12 months;



· relate to the election or removal of directors, and the election or removal of
  directors was presented at an annual or special meeting of shareholders held
  within 120 days prior to the date the special meeting request was delivered;



· are substantially similar to another proposal, including the election or
  removal of directors, that is included in the Company's notice as an item of
  business to be brought before a shareholder meeting that has been called but
  not yet held or that is called for a date within 120 days of the receipt of the
  request;



· are made in a manner that violates Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; or
· are presented by a shareholder that has violated the reporting requirements of
  Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
The Bylaws, as amended, provide that a special meeting must be called within 120
days after the receipt by the Company's Corporate Secretary of valid requests by
holders of the requisite number of shares.
The foregoing descriptions of the amendments to the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the amendments to the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which are attached to this Current Report as
Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

SUNRISE, Fla., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Federated National Holding Company (Nasdaq:FNHC), a Florida-based provider of insurance, today announced that it plans to hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Tuesday, September 12, 2017 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Sunrise - Sawgrass Mills, located at 13400 West Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida 33323.  Shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 13, 2017 will be eligible to vote at the meeting.  The Company will mail and provide access to its definitive proxy materials to its shareholders prior to the Annual Meeting.
About the Company
The Company is authorized to underwrite, and/or place through our wholly owned subsidiaries, homeowners' multi-peril ("homeowners"), commercial general liability, federal flood, personal auto and various other lines of insurance in Florida and various other states.  The Company also serves as managing general agent for its joint venture, Monarch National Insurance Company.  The Company markets and distributes its own and third-party insurers' products and our other services through a network of independent agents. The Company also utilizes a select number of general agents for the same purpose.
Forward-Looking Statements /Safe Harbor Statements

Safe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:


Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "envision," "estimate," "expect," "guidance," "indicate," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "possibly," "potential," "predict," "probably," "pro-forma," "project," "seek," "should," "target," or "will" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon and similar words or phrases or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.


Forward-looking statements might also include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:



Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, dividends, capital structure or other financial items or measures;


Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, insurance products/or services; 


Forecasts of future insurable events, economic performance, liquidity, need for funding and income; and


Descriptions of assumptions or estimates underlying or relating to any of the foregoing.



The risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally; the nature of the Company's business; the adequacy of its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense; claims experience; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and hail) and other catastrophic losses; reinsurance costs and the ability of reinsurers to indemnify the Company; raising additional capital and our potential failure to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements; potential assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations; the effectiveness of internal financial controls; the effectiveness of our underwriting, pricing and related loss limitation methods; changes in loss trends, including as a result of insureds' assignment of benefits; court decisions and trends in litigation; our potential failure to pay claims accurately; ability to obtain regulatory approval applications for requested rate increases, or to underwrite in additional jurisdictions, and the timing thereof; the impact that the results of the Monarch joint venture may have on our results of operations; inflation and other changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); pricing competition and other initiatives by competitors; legislative and regulatory developments; the outcome of litigation pending against the Company, and any settlement thereof; dependence on investment income and the composition of the Company's investment portfolio; insurance agents; ratings by industry services; the reliability of our information technology systems; reliance on key personnel; acts of war and terrorist activities; and other matters described from time to time by the Company in releases and publications, and in periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.


In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including claims and litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a contingency. Reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.


Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.
