Welcome to Palmer and Duncan Veterinary Surgeons


Palmer and Duncan Veterinary Surgeons was established in December 2000, by Margaret Palmer and Gordon Duncan. The aim of the practice has always been and always will be to provide the best possible care in a friendly and compassionate environment.  Our ethos is to treat our patients as if they were our own and our clients the way we would expect to be treated.
 Consultations are by appointment from 8.00a.m. to 7.30p.m. Monday to Friday, and from 8.00a.m. To 4.00p.m. on Saturdays.  We recognise that both clients and their pets are often stressed during their visits to vets, by operating an appointment system this reduces both the waiting time and the stress levels to a minimum. 
 Palmer & Duncan are committed to maintaining a high level of care to their patients and clients and therefore have a continuing education programme for all members of staff, and have been accredited as a tier 2 practice by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS accreditation is awarded to  a Practice after inspection and certifies that the Practice conforms to designated standards).

Industry Update




Appointment14 July 2016Duncan Palmer
Appointed Managing Director
							At The Murray Building in Hong Kong, Hong Kong (SAR)

View Duncan Palmer's LinkedIn Profile
 Marco Polo Hotels has appointed seasoned luxury hotelier Duncan
Palmer as Managing Director of its Hong Kong flagship property, the Murray Building, scheduled
to open in October 2017.
With over 35 years of experience in many senior management roles for luxury hotel groups
worldwide including Mandarin Oriental, The Savoy and Langham Hotel Groups, Mr. Palmer is the
perfect fit for the iconic landmark Murray Building nestled between the vibrant districts of Central
and Admiralty.
Originating from the United Kingdom, Mr. Palmer throughout his career has successfully
spearheaded a number of global luxury hotel repositioning and redevelopment projects, mostly in
historic and flagship properties. His earlier days with The Savoy Group saw him revitalise the
heritage property The Savoy, London with a restoration programme, which resulted in the hotel’s
performance significantly improving, and celebrating accolades of ‘Worldwide Hotel of the Year
by Executive Travel Magazine. In addition, he also received the ‘One of the Top 10 Hotels in
Europe for Service 2001’ award for The Connaught, London by Travel + Leisure Magazine.
Mr. Palmer is no stranger to Hong Kong: he spent four years in Asia’s world city during his tenure
with Langham Hospitality Group, as Managing Director of The Langham, Hong Kong and was
Vice President Design for the group worldwide.  In his new role, Mr. Palmer will be instrumental in setting a new benchmark for the luxury hotel
sector. The transition from group level to Managing Director is a clear indication of his insatiable
desire to transform this iconic landmark into a highly revered hotel.
