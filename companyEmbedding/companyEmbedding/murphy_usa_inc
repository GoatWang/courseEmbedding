Fleet Cards
At Murphy USA, we are committed to helping businesses save money — and time — at the pump. We proudly offer Fleet Cards designed to help our business customers keep track of and reduce fuel expenses wherever possible. Feel free to explore our fleet fuel programs. Both deliver compelling savings, fraud protection, and specific spending measures.


Private Label Card
Feel secure and stay in control of your company’s fuel spending. Our easy-to-read monthly reporting package lets you know who purchases what, when and where. You’ll always save at least $.01 per gallon regardless of how much fuel you purchase — but the more you spend, the more you save.

Fuel rebates up to $.04 per gallon
Driver ID required for security
Ability to set purchase controls
Accepted at more than 1,200 Murphy USA and Murphy Express locations in 23 states

The Universal Card is valid at more than 90% of U.S. retail fuel locations, plus optional acceptance at thousands of service locations nationwide. Wherever you are, Murphy USA is the go-to place for fuel savings every time you fill up.

Everyone has to get to their go-to place — help them get there with a Fuel & More gift card from Murphy USA.
Use it at the pump or the counter, just like a credit or debit card. Plus, you can use it for snacks, drinks, and more at Murphy USA.
Fuel & More gift cards are perfect for birthdays and holidays or just saying thank you. And because each Fuel & More card is fully reloadable, it’s the gift that keeps on giving.

El Dorado, Arkansas, May 1, 2017 - Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA), a leading marketer of retail motor fuel products and convenience merchandise, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
Key Highlights:

Net loss was $3.0 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share in Q1 2017 compared to net income of $85.9 million in Q1 2016; the prior year included a gain on disposition of the CAM pipeline system of $56.0 million, after-tax 
Total retail gallons grew 0.6% to 1.01 billion gallons for the network in Q1 2017 while volumes on an APSM basis declined 3.6% versus prior year quarter and retail fuel margins declined from 11.1 cpg to 10.1 cpg 
Total fuel contribution (combined retail fuel margin and PS&W results including RINs) for Q1 2017 was 10.1 cpg compared to 14.1 cpg in Q1 2016 
Total merchandise contribution dollars grew 3.4% year-over-year, a decline of 0.9% APSM, to $88.8 million at higher average unit margins of 15.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year quarter 
Five stores opened during the quarter with construction in progress at 35 new sites, including 17 raze-and-rebuild locations 
Common shares repurchased in the quarter totaled 268,490 for $17 million at an average price of approximately $65 per share under the previously announced share repurchase program of up to $500 million, leaving $159 million of authority remaining

"After posting our highest first quarter last year, Q1 EBITDA this year fell to its lowest level since 2012 as record industry refined product inventory levels led to depressed wholesale prices, regulatory and political uncertainty dampened RIN prices, and seasonally weak demand at the beginning of the year impacted retail volume," said President and CEO Andrew Clyde.  "However, throughout these peaks and troughs associated with fuel volatility, we continue to drive significant improvements to our underlying business, leading to higher total merchandising profits and lower per-store operating expenses.  At the same time, we continue to execute our approach to strategic capital allocation, balancing high quality organic growth with meaningful share repurchases, while leveraging our balance sheet appropriately.  As Q1 market factors have begun to normalize, our long-term approach to managing the business shines through."

Income from continuing operations, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share declined in the Q1 2017 period due to lower total fuel contribution from retail and PS&W including RINs along with higher SG&A and payment fees. Additionally, first quarter 2016 earnings reflect a $56 million after-tax gain on the disposition of the CAM pipeline system.

Total fuel contribution dollars decreased 27.5% in Q1 2017 due to lower contribution from both retail and midstream components of our fuel business. 
Total retail fuel contribution was lower by 8.9% due to lower volume and margins, as a flatter market structure in Q1 2017, when compared to price declines that occurred in the prior year, created more challenging pricing conditions.  Total network retail gallons sold in the quarter increased 0.6% despite taking down 17 high-performing stores in the quarter for raze-and-rebuild activity. Same store gallons declined by 3.0%.  Product Supply & Wholesale generated a loss in the period, as excess winter-grade refined product and subdued retail demand drove higher gasoline inventories that put pressure on the spot-to-rack margin.  In addition, RIN prices were volatile during the quarter due to regulatory and political uncertainty.

Merchandise total sales increased 0.7% to $565.8 million in 2017 from $561.7 million in 2016 and was primarily due to an increase in non-tobacco sales of 3.2% average per store month (APSM), offset by a decrease in tobacco products revenue of 5.6% APSM.
Quarterly merchandise margins in 2017 were higher than 2016.  The increase in gross margin dollars of 3.4% in the current period was due primarily to benefits recognized from the Core-Mark supply contract, in addition to per store improvements and improved promotional effectiveness.  As a result, total unit margins were up by 40 basis points from 15.3% in the prior period to 15.7% in the current year.

Total station and other operating expenses increased $8.0 million for the quarter, reflecting higher payment fees and new store additions.  On a per store basis, operating expenses excluding credit card fees declined 2.5% with labor costs down 9.6%, partially offset by maintenance related costs.
Total SG&A was up $6.7 million during Q1 2017 due to the $2.1 million restructuring charge taken in the period combined with higher labor and employee benefit costs and certain technology costs. SG&A expense is expected to moderate in the upcoming quarters and achieve a full year result within the guided range.
Station Openings
Murphy USA opened five retail locations in Q1 2017, bringing the quarter end store count to 1,406, consisting of 1,152 Murphy USA sites and 254 Murphy Express sites.  A total of 35 stores are currently under construction, which includes 17 raze and rebuild locations.

Note
Average Per Store Month (APSM) metric includes all stores open through the date of the calculation.
Same Store Sales (SSS) metric includes aggregated individual store results for all stores open throughout both periods presented.  For all periods presented, the store must have been open for the entire calendar year to be included in the comparison.  Remodeled stores that remained open or were closed for just a very brief time (less than a month) during the period being compared remain in the same store sales calculation.  If a store is replaced either at the same location (raze and rebuild) or relocated to a new location, it will typically be excluded from the calculation during the period it is out of service.  New constructed sites do not enter the calculation until they are open for each full calendar year for the periods being compared (open by January 1, 2016 for the sites being compared in the 2017 versus 2016 calculations).

Supplemental Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information
The following table sets forth the Company's Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  EBITDA means net income (loss) plus net interest expense, plus income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA adds back (i) other non-cash items (e.g., impairment of properties and accretion of asset retirement obligations) and (ii) other items that management does not consider to be meaningful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., (income) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of assets and other non-operating expense (income)).  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures that are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
We use this Adjusted EBITDA in our operational and financial decision-making, believing that such measure is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations.    Adjusted EBITDA is also used by many of our investors, research analysts, investment bankers, and lenders to assess our operating performance.  However, non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures, and Adjusted EBITDA may be prepared differently by us than by other companies using similarly titled non-GAAP measures.
The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

The Company also considers Free Cash Flow in the operation of its business.  Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for us in evaluating the Company's performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.
Numerous methods may exist to calculate a company's free cash flow.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow.  The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow:

https://www.facebook.com/MurphyUSAServing approximately 1.6 million customers per day, according to the company, Murphy USA operates more than 1,400 stores under the Murphy USA and Murphy Express banners. Murphy USA stations are typically located near a Wal-Mart store, while Murphy Express stores are standalone stations. Murphy USA stations tend to be smaller, kiosk-format stores, while Murphy Express stations tend to be larger, traditional convenience store formats.In early 2016, Wal-Mart curtailed a 20-year relationship with Murphy USA, announcing that going forward it would build and operate its own gas stations. Murphy USA will continue to run the more than 1,000 branded locations it already has in Wal-Mart parking lots.Murphy USA’s competitive advantage is its high-volume, low-cost operations at its kiosks, which are positioned in the marketplace as a destination for fuel and cigarettes, offering competitive pricing and speed of service. Murphy is also notable for its category management excellence. Two current category managers and one former—John Deichler, Steven Desautels and Felix Oliu—were all winners in CSP’s 2017 Category Manager of the Year awards. Source:

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
