Peripheral Artery Disease






 



Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is the narrowing or blockage of vessels that carry blood from the heart to the extremities. Caused by the buildup of plaque within the walls of arteries, PAD occurs primarily in the legs, but can be found in vessels throughout the body.1 Common PAD symptoms include pain, aching or cramping while walking (claudication) and non-healing ulcers or sores (critical limb ischemia). PAD is also a marker for significant cardiovascular morbidities and patients generally present with many co-morbidities.1
Initial treatment for PAD is through medication and lifestyle adjustments. More advanced cases are treated using invasive surgical bypass or minimally invasive interventional procedures. Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), the most advanced patients, may have a combination of surgery (amputation) and interventional therapy.
Although angioplasty is often considered to be the leading interventional treatment for PAD, recent studies have revealed that angioplasty 12 month patency rates are estimated to be 30-50%.2 When angioplasty fails, stent implantation can help improve patency, but the underlying issues relating to the presence of calcification remain and stent placement reduces future treatment options. More recently, Drug Coated Balloons have been introduced to the market. Designed to target the inflammatory response caused by angioplasty, these have shown an improvement in the patency of standard lesions but are known to be significantly less effective in the presence of calcification.3
 
 
 


Peripheral Artery Disease and Calcium

As patients with PAD live longer thanks to improved therapeutic options and lifestyle changes, the plaque in their arteries mineralizes and becomes calcified. Over the last few decades, the prevalence of calcified lesions has risen along with life expectancy, with severe calcium being present in as many as 60% of patients with PAD.3 The incremental nature of improvements to devices available to treat these lesions has resulted in calcium becoming a significant obstacle to achieving successful outcomes.
The most common device used to treat calcified lesions is a standard balloon dilatation catheter, often deployed at very high constant pressure. Unfortunately, the physics of constant high pressures in the presence of calcium preferentially targets, or damages, soft tissue leading to elastic recoil, dissections and frequently requires a bailout stent. This has been known to occur in up to 60% of standard lesions, and may occur even more often in calcified lesions.4
Over the last 20 years several technologies have been developed in an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, some incremental such as scoring and cutting balloons, and others more dramatic and severe such as atherectomy. Each of these fails to address the fundamental need: effective dilation of calcified lesions while limiting vascular injury and complications such as perforations, distal emboli, and the need for bailout stenting.
 
 
Lithoplasty Technology Solution for PAD

Shockwave Medical leveraged the power of Lithoplasty® Technology to develop devices for the treatment of calcified peripheral vascular lesions. Built on a semi-compliant balloon platform, each catheter incorporates multiple lithotripsy emitters activated (with the touch of a button) while the integrated balloon is inflated to low sub-nominal pressures. Once activated, these emitters produce pulsatile mechanical waves that are inherently tissue-selective, passing through the balloon and soft vascular tissue, preferentially disrupting the calcified plaque by creating a series of micro-fractures. Once the calcium has been disrupted, the vessel can be effectively dilated using low pressures thereby enabling even historically challenging PAD patients to be treated effectively and with minimal injury to the vessel.5
In an initial peripheral clinical study of 99% moderate and severely calcified lesions, Lithoplasty Technology demonstrated ease of use, minimal interruption to procedure flow and an excellent safety profile. Treatment with Lithoplasty Technology resulted in a low residual stenosis of 24% and with only 1 stent implanted. Click here for more information.
The technology is inherently familiar, easy to use, operates with just the push of a button, and works seamlessly with existing cardiovascular treatments. And because it is built on a traditional balloon catheter platform, it is compatible with clinicians’ existing workflow.
 
 
Product Details

Peripheral Lithoplasty Balloon Dilatation catheters are available in diameters ranging from 3.5mm to 7.0mm. Standard balloon techniques, integrated proximal and distal markers and predetermined Lithoplasty Technology settings ensure the catheters can be prepared, delivered, accurately placed and activated with minimal disruption to standard procedure flow.
Miniaturized lithotripsy emitters apply intermittent pulsatile pressure waves along the length and diameter of the balloon. Activated under low pressure (4 atmospheres), these pressure waves selectively disrupt calcified lesions, after which the balloon can be dilated to reference vessel diameter.

Summary of Treatment Options for PAD and Calcium




TREATMENT
DESCRIPTION
Impact on Calcium


Surgical Bypass


A graft connects above and below a blockage, creating a new path for blood to flow.




Can completely bypass calcified lesions but calcium in the artery may limit proximal starting and distal landing zones.




Angioplasty


A catheter with a balloon in its tip is advanced to reach the narrowed or blocked artery.
The balloon is inflated, widening the vessel by pushing the plaque against the artery wall.
Cutting or scoring balloons could be used in place of standard balloons to cut into soft tissue.
This could be supplemented with the use of a Drug Coated Balloon to reduce the inflammatory response of the vessel due to the injury caused by angioplasty.




Excessive force transfers to soft tissue leads to elastic recoil, poor lesion expansion and frequent dissections, requiring stent placement for efficacy or bailout reasons.
Scoring or cutting elements have limited effectiveness in calcified lesions.
DCB have not been shown to improve patency rates in calcified vessels.




Stenting


A stent is a tiny mesh tube that is placed inside an artery, often after angioplasty, to help keep the vessel open.
Stents are designed to remain in the blood vessel indefinitely.




Can be difficult to deliver in highly calcified lesions.
Insufficient radial strength may lead to suboptimal luminal gain.
Increased risk of stent fracture.
Permanent implant limits and adds complexity to future treatment options.




Atherectomy


Extracts atherosclerotic plaque through sanding or shaving of vessel tissue.




Can be acutely effective in superficial calcium, but neglects the deep calcium that impacts vessel expansion.
Extensive soft tissue removal creates significant vessel injury and increases the risk of vessel perforation and distal embolization.
Difficult to use, interrupts procedure flow. Complicated and lengthy procedures requiring specialized training and a change to normal procedure flow.




Lithoplasty Balloon Dilatation Catheters


Harness the power of Lithoplasty Technology to disrupt calcium.
Semi-compliant balloon catheters with multiple lithotripsy emitters along the length of the balloon.
Delivers pulsatile mechanical energy that disrupts both superficial and deep calcium.
Pulsing occurs at sub-nominal pressures followed by dilatation to reference vessel diameter.

Pulsatile mechanical energy is inherently tissue-selective, disrupting calcium while minimizing injury to soft tissue.
Low-pressure dilatations avoid injury to vessel walls while maximizing luminal gain.
Familiar balloon-based technology is compatible with clinician’s existing workflow.

About Us
Shockwave Medical is revolutionizing the interventional treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease, creating new opportunities for patients and physicians by effectively targeting calcified plaque.






 






History
In 2009, three seasoned medical device entrepreneurs founded Shockwave Medical to pursue the notion of using lithotripsy, a trusted technology historically used to break kidney stones, to disrupt calcified plaque in blood vessels. Their mission was to change the nature of interventional therapy for advanced cardiovascular disease. Seven years later, the team at Shockwave Medical is developing a range of lithotripsy-enhanced interventional devices to realize that vision.

Executive Summary




Executive Summary​The Lithoplasty System combines sound waves with angioplasty to treat calcified plaque in diseased peripheral arteries. The system consists of three components: a single-use proprietary balloon catheter, a reusable generator, and a reusable connector cable. The balloon catheter has integrated lithotripsy emitters designed to enhance angioplasty by disrupting calcium before balloon dilation of the stenosis. Conclusions:  One unpublished case series (DISRUPT PAD, n = 95) identified in regulatory documents from FDA suggests that the Lithoplasty System is safe and works in most patients to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD) for 6 months. The reported procedural success was 97%, with no major adverse events at 30-days postprocedure and 96.8% freedom from major adverse events at 6 months. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.Longer-term data are expected to become available from ongoing trials. In the absence of controlled trials, no conclusion can be reached regarding comparative effectiveness.Evidence: Search dates January 1, 2011, to November 1, 2016. No published studies identified; FDA 510(k) summary documents described 1 small case series.  One multicenter case series (DISRUPT PAD Study) assessed the Lithoplasty System to treat 95 patients with symptomatic PAD and calcified femoropopliteal lesions up to 15 cm in length.Safety: No Health Devices Alerts or MAUDE reports found.  Ongoing trials: Three ongoing trials identifiedOne single-arm study evaluating safety and performance in patients with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries expected to complete in 2016.One single-arm study assessing early safety and performance expected to end in June 2017. One multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1 ratio) study of Lithoplasty followed drug-coated balloon (DCB) versus DCB with standard balloon predilatation for treating moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries; expected to complete in April 2020.

Full TextProduct OverviewThe Lithoplasty System combines sound waves with angioplasty to treat calcified plaque in patients with PAD. The system consists of three components: a single-use proprietary balloon catheter, a reusable generator, and a reusable connector cable. The balloon catheter has integrated lithotripsy emitters designed to enhance angioplasty by disrupting calcium before balloon dilation of the stenosis. During a percutaneous procedure, the physician delivers the catheter through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the target lesion. Partially inflating the balloon energizes the lithotripsy emitters, which generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the balloon at the treatment site. Subsequent low-pressure balloon dilation of the stenosis facilitates passage of blood.  Purported Benefits/Advantages According to Manufacturer Information* "Delivers pulsatile mechanical energy that disrupts both superficial and deep calcium.""Pulsatile mechanical energy is inherently tissue-selective, disrupting calcium while minimizing injury to soft tissue.""Low-pressure dilatations avoid injury to vessel walls while maximizing luminal gain.""Familiar balloon-based technology is compatible with clinician's existing workflow." "Lithoplasty catheters have shown effective deliverability with 100% successful crossing of moderate and severely calcified lesions with limited need for adjunctive therapy.""Combines the calcium disrupting power of lithotripsy with the familiarity and simplicity of a balloon in a single enabling device.""Lithotripsy pulses selectively target and disrupt calcium in the peripheral vasculature, improving tissue flexibility." *Note: This is a list of the main benefits described by the manufacturer and does not imply endorsement or validation by ECRI Institute. Regulatory StatusIn September 2016, FDA granted 510(k) clearance (K161384) for the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty System. The primary predicate device for the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty System is the AngioSculpt PTA Scoring Balloon Catheter (Spectranetics, Inc.) (K142983). Additional predicate devices in terms of intended use and technologic characteristics are the Bard Peripheral Vascular VascuTrak PTA Dilatation Catheter (K103459) and the Lysus Micro-Infusion System (EKOS Corp.) (K060422).The 
   labeling reads:The Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty System is intended for lithotripsy-enhanced balloon dilatation of lesions, including calcified lesions, in the peripheral vasculature, including the iliac, femoral, ilio-femoral, popliteal, infra-popliteal, and renal arteries. Not for use in the coronary or cerebral vasculature.
Safety information on the company website states the following:Do not use if unable to pass 0.014" guidewire across the lesion Not intended for treatment of in-stent restenosis or in coronary, carotid, or cerebrovascular arteriesCurrent Treatments PAD, most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows the affected artery, which in turn limits the amount of oxygen-rich blood circulating to the affected tissues. The most commonly affected arteries are in the legs. Patients with PAD in the legs may experience signs and symptoms that include numbness, pain upon walking and/or climbing stairs, and an infection in the leg that is difficult to treat. PAD increases the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and heart attack. Clinicians initially manage PAD by recommending lifestyle changes (i.e., smoking cessation, improved diet, exercise). Medical therapy may include medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, improve walking capacity, control blood sugar, help prevent blood clots, and relieve symptoms. Clinicians may treat more advanced PAD with a minimally invasive endovascular option (e.g., balloon angioplasty with stent or stent-graft placement, atherectomy). DCBs designed to target the inflammatory response caused by angioplasty have recently emerged. Surgical treatments for PAD include arterial bypass and endarterectomy (i.e., plaque removal). For additional information about atherosclerosis and PAD, see links to the documents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute under 
   Selected References and Resources.Clinical LiteratureWe searched PubMed, EMBASE, and selected web-based resources for documents relevant to this topic and published between January 1, 2011, and November 1, 2016. We did not identify any published studies of this technology. We identified one relevant study detailed in the 
   FDA 510(k) summary document. See Table 1 for further details of the study summary.  One multicenter case series (i.e., DISRUPT PAD Study) is assessing the Lithoplasty System to treat 95 patients with symptomatic PAD and evidence of calcified femoropopliteal lesions up to 15 cm in length.The DISRUPT PAD study reported a major adverse event rate of 0% at 30 days and 3.2% at 6 months. Procedural success was achieved in 100% of the study patients at 30 days and in 91.6% at 6 months. Three patients (3.2%) required target lesion revascularizations within six months. Findings from the DISRUPT PAD study suggest that the Lithoplasty System is safe and may work as intended to treat PAD for up to six months. However, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.In the absence of controlled trials, no conclusion can be reached regarding comparative effectiveness.Our searches of ClinicalTrials.gov identified three ongoing trials of the Lithoplasty System: a single-arm study evaluating safety and performance in patients with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries expected to end in 2016; a single-arm study assessing early safety and performance expected to end in June 2017; and a multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with Lithoplasty plus DCB and treatment with DCB plus standard balloon predilatation for moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries expected to end in April 2020.SafetyWe also searched ECRI Institute's Health Devices Alerts database and FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for product-specific alerts, recalls, and adverse events. We did not identify any relevant information.  Table 1. Product-specific Clinical Literature

FDA Summary
DISRUPT PAD Program34 investigators participated at 7 sites in Austria, NewZealand, and GermanyReviewed FDA summaryMulticenter case series95 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) and evidence of calcified femoropopliteal lesions up to 15 cm in lengthLithoplasty System"The study met its primary safety endpoint. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for freedom from Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days of 97.0% was above the performance goal of 91.3%. The freedom from MAE at 30 days was 100%. The study also met its primary effectiveness endpoint. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for procedural success of 97.0% was above the performance goal of 89.3%. Procedural success was defined as <50% with or without adjunctive therapy was 100%."Freedom from MAE at 6 months was 96.8%. There were no cardiovascular deaths, target limb major amputations, perforations, symptomatic thrombus or distal embolization events. Secondary effectiveness endpoints were also favorable. Procedural success defined as <50% without adjunctive therapy was achieved in 91.6% of subjects. In addition, procedural success defined as ≤30% with or without adjunctive therapy was achieved in 89.5%. Target lesion patency assessed by duplex ultrasound at 30 days and 6 months was 100% and 76.7% respectively. Three target lesion revascularizations (TLR) occurred within 6 months of follow-up for a true rate of 3.2%.Functional outcomes including change in ankle-brachial index (ABI), Rutherford Category and walking impairment showed a sustained and statistically significant improvement from baseline and data available at 30 days and 6 months.""The DISRUPT PAD program met the study success criteria. The Lithoplasty System demonstrated safety with minimal vessel injury, and minimal use of stenting. Acute effectiveness results showed high procedural success and a large acutegain in vessel diameter post procedure. Patency, TLR and functional outcomes weredurable through 6 months in available patients. These results demonstrate the safety and performance of the Lithoplasty System for the treatment of subjects with calcified, stenotic lesions." Table 2.
