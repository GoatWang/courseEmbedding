History[edit]
Founded by Robert Addison Day in 1971 and headquartered in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of investment products.[1] The TCW Group was originally known as Trust Company of the West. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as foreign investors and high-net-worth individuals.[2]
In 2001, Société Générale (SocGen) acquired a controlling interest in The TCW Group.[3][4]
On February 24, 2010, TCW announced the completion of its acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC (MetWest), a leading fixed income investment management firm.[5]
In February 2013, TCW management and alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group acquired TCW Group from Société Générale.[6] As a result of the transaction, TCW management and employees increased their ownership in the firm to approximately 40% on a fully diluted basis, better aligning interests with clients. Equity for the investment came from two Carlyle investment funds and from TCW management.[7]
As of March 31, 2017, TCW had $194.3 billion of assets under management or committed to management.[8] The CEO of The TCW Group is David Lippman.[9]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Los Angeles with offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

TCW High Dividend Equities Long-Short Fund

Quarterly Commentary

June 30, 2017

Iman H. Brivanlou, PhD




The TCW High Dividend Equities Long/Short Fund generated a gain of 0.52% during
the quarter, underperforming the S&P 500 Index gain of 3.09%. Negative allocation
effects, particularly in Healthcare and cash, drove our underperformance relative to
the benchmark. Despite the continued rebound in global equity markets, we maintain
that the current environment is one where substantial caution is warranted, and have
positioned the portfolio accordingly...

Media AttachmentsQuarterly CommentaryTCW High Dividend Equities Long/Short Fund - Second Quarter 2017Legal DisclosuresInvestment Risks

The Fund is new. Accordingly, investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy or may not employ a successful investment strategy, which could result in the Fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and could have negative tax consequences for shareholders. The Sub-Adviser also may not be fully able to implement their investment strategies within the regulatory constraints for mutual funds.
 
The investment strategies employed by the Fund are alternative strategies that have not been applied to mutual funds for an extended period of time. Accordingly, the Fund is subject to the risk that anticipated opportunities do not play out as planned, or that there are unexpected challenges in implementing the Fund’s strategies due to regulatory constraints for mutual funds. Alternative strategies often engage in various forms of leverage and other investment practices that are speculative and involve a higher degree of risk than traditional investments. Such practices may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss, including the entire amount that is invested. Alternative investments may not be suitable for all investors.
Equity investments entail equity risk and price-volatility risk. The value of stocks and other equity securities may change based on changes in a company's financial condition and in overall market and economic conditions. Funds investing in mid-cap companies involve special risks including higher volatility and lower liquidity. 
As the writer of an index call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the index covering the call option above  the exercise price of the call option. Since the Fund’s investment strategy does not contemplate investing in or replicating a particular index, the Fund will not profit from increases in market value of a particular index. Therefore, selling index call options also can limit the Fund’s opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of the Stock Portfolio; however, only to the extent that the Stock Portfolio correlates with the index underlying the call option written by the Fund.
As part of its investment strategy, the Fund sells index call options to hedge the Stock Portfolio. There is the risk that the returns of the Stock Portfolio do not correlate with those of the indexes on which the call options are written. Further, the Sub-Adviser may not correctly assess the degree of correlation between the performance of the basket of indexes used in the hedging strategy and the performance of the equity securities in the Stock Portfolio being hedged. It is also not possible to hedge fully or perfectly against any risk, and hedging entails its own costs.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.
