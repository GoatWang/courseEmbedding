This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

	FEBRUARY 19, 2015

	FOR
	THE





	JOINT MEETING OF
	SHAREHOLDERS

	TO BE HELD ON MARCH 31, 2015





	Patrick P. Coyne, the sole
	interested Trustee and Chairman of the Funds Board has announced his intention
	to retire from Delaware Management Company (DMC), the Funds investment
	manager. Mr. Coyne intends to remain available through the end of September to
	assist with the appointment of his successor and to help ensure a smooth
	transition for DMC. Thomas L. Bennett will succeed Mr. Coyne as Chairman of the
	Board of the Funds effective March 1, 2015. Mr. Coyne has agreed to stand for
	election at the Funds joint meeting of shareholders (the Meeting), as
	described in the attached Proxy Statement, and intends to continue to serve as
	the Funds sole interested Trustee until the earlier of his departure from DMC,
	or the appointment of his successor as a Trustee of the Funds. To the extent
	that all nominee trustees are elected at the Meeting, Mr. Coynes successor can
	be appointed by the remaining Trustees without a shareholder vote, consistent
	with the Funds charter documents and the Investment Company Act of 1940.




	Any capitalized terms used in
	this supplemental material that are not defined have the same meaning as in the
	Proxy Statement.

The following table details the Company’s intended use of proceeds from this
Offering, for the first twelve (12) months after successful completion of the
Offering.  The Company intends to prioritize it’s spending accordingly: Legal,
Audit, Other (Accounting), Design and Patenting, then Marketing, Website design
and Administrative.  Since the Company does not intend to pay any Offering
expenses from the proceeds from this Offering, and assuming that 100% of the
Offering is sold, the gross aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows:

Expenditure Item**                                 Allocated Proceeds
Legal Fees                                                    $15,000
Audit Fees                                                     10,000
Other Fees (Accounting, transfer agent, etc.)                  10,000
Design and Patenting                                           25,000
Manufacturing Costs                                            25,000
Marketing Expenses                                             10,000
Website design, development, hosting & maintenance              2,500
Administrative and Business Development                         2,500
Total                                                        $100,000

There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any
funds received will be immediately available to us.

**The above expenditures are defined as follows:

Legal Fees:  Fees paid to our attorneys for preparation and filing of SEC
documents, and other state and federal documents, (not including the preparation
and filing of our non-provisional patent application; See “Design and
Patenting”) as well as preparation of contracts and agreements, and consultation
on business matters relating to operation of the business.  These legal fees do
not include fees associated with this Offering.

Audit Fees: Fees paid to our registered independent auditor to audit and review
our financial statements in relation to SEC reporting requirements once we are
required to do so.  These fees do not include fees associated with this
Offering.

Other Fees:  Fees paid to our accountants for ongoing financial statement
preparation.  Fees paid to the transfer agent for issuing corporate stock and
facilitating subsequent stock transactions and oversight, and any other fees
that may be paid for ongoing corporate services.  These fees do not include fees
associated with this Offering.

Design and Patenting: Monies expended to prepare (including research of existing
patent filings, preparation of design drawings and other materials needed to
complete the non-provisional patent application.) and file a non-provisional
patent application for our proposed product.  These fees will be expended on
preparing scale CAD drawings, patent filing fees, third-party (e.g. legal) fees
for filing non-provisional utility patent.  The Company estimates the patent
filing fees, payable to the USPTO, for a non-provisional patent will be $1,420,
plus an additional $300-$500 payable to a professional third-party specializing
in CAD Drawings/renderings.  The basic filing fee with the USPTO is $70.  The
USPTO search fee is $300 for a small entity.  The USPTO examination fee is $360
for a small entity.  The initial fees cover 3 independent/dependent claims:
additional claims are $210.  In addition to the filing fees, the non-provisional
patent issue fee with USPTO is $480.  Maintaining the most judicial use of
funds, without an attorney will cost Deluxe approximately $1420.  The Company
anticipates the cost of preparing and filing a non-provisional patent
application (including fees for the patent agent’s time for preparing the
application and responding to comments from the USPTO, plus applicable
government fees) will range from $10,000-$20,000.  These fees do not include
fees associated with this Offering.

Manufacturing Costs: Monies paid to a third-party manufacturer to produce the
initial order of the Company’s proposed product. These fees do not include fees
associated with this Offering.

Marketing Expenses:  Costs of marketing our proposed product to potential
manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers through first-in-search
online marketing, development and dissemination of promotional materials
(including design schematics) such as full-color, high-gloss literature, and
compressed demo video for email.  These fees do not include fees associated with
this Offering.  If 100% of our Offering is sold, Deluxe expects to spend
approximately $1,000 on promotional literature and printing and approximately
$2,000 for the production of several high-definition compressed promotional
videos.  Deluxe will allocate approximately $5,000 towards fees associated with
renting space at trade shows.  Deluxe will allocate approximately $2,000 for
promotional activities at fishing derbies: including donating rod-holders as
prizes, and/or donating printed t-shirts, hats, hoodies, and other varieties of
promotional materials.

Website design, development, hosting and maintenance:  Monies paid to
independent contractors to host and maintain the Company website.  These fees do
not include fees associated with this Offering.

Administrative and Business Development:  Any monies paid for equipment,
software, communications, postage and shipping, office supplies and other
miscellaneous items that are administrative and business development in nature.
These fees do not include fees associated with this Offering.

There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire amount of this
Offering.  The Offering is being made on a best-effort, no minimum basis. Tables
presented in this section are for illustrative purposes only; the actual amount
and use of proceeds, if any, may differ.

The following chart details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 75% of
this Offering:

Expenditure Item**                              75%  
Legal Fees                                    $15,000
Audit Fees                                     10,000
Other Fees (Accounting, transfer agent, etc.)   5,000
Design and Patenting                           18,750
Manufacturing Costs                            18,750
Marketing Expenses                              2,500
Website Design                                  2,500
Administrative and Business Development         2,500
Total                                         $75,000                                             

If only 75% of this Offering is sold, the Company will have to reduce its
development plans slightly.  Its legal and auditing requirements will be met at
the same level as would be done if 100% of the stock Offering were sold.  We
will have less money for other fees, patenting and reduced marketing dollars.
Deluxe will allocate its marketing dollars as follows: approximately $250
towards literature/printing; approximately $500 towards the production of a few,
high-definition compressed promotional videos; approximately $1250 towards fees
associated with renting space at trade shows; and approximately $500 for
promotional use at fishing derbies.  A budget of $18,750 for Design and
Patenting is enough funding to have a third party or agent carry forward the
patenting process; however, if the application process is drawn out or otherwise
more involved than anticipated, the Company will need to reduce the level of
involvement of a third-party patent agent and respond to any USPTO comments and
inquiries without the benefit of a third-party patent agent.

The following chart details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 50% of
this Offering:

Expenditure Item**                              50%  
Legal Fees                                    $10,000
Audit Fees                                     10,000
Other Fees (Accounting, transfer agent, etc.)   5,000
Design and Patenting                           11,750
Manufacturing Costs                            11,750
Marketing Expenses                                500
Website Design                                    500
Administrative and Business Development           500
Total                                         $50,000

If only 50% of this Offering is sold, the Company will have to strictly curtail
its development plans.  It will only utilize attorneys to do what is necessary
to meet its SEC, state and Federal reporting and licensing requirements.  Its
audit requirements will be met at the same level as would be done if 100% of the
stock Offering were sold.  We will look to other less expensive ways of having
our financials prepared and we will engage our transfer agents for only the most
necessary tasks.  Deluxe will allocate its marketing dollars as follows:
approximately $100 towards literature/printing; approximately $50 towards the
production of a high-definition compressed promotional video; approximately $200
towards fees associated with renting space at trade shows; and approximately
$150 for promotional use at fishing derbies. Deluxe will look to other more
creative ways of financing our website development and operation.  Although
there is no written agreement, and no guarantee such a loan will be made, our
President is prepared to pay additional expenses, as necessary, by loaning the
Company, on a shareholder loan basis, up to $100,000 during our first year of
operations.  A budget of $11,750 for Design and Patenting is not enough funding
to have a third party or agent carry out the patenting process in its entirely.
Deluxe will have to work jointly with an agent and endeavor to co-create the
documents and designs necessary to file the application.  Moreover Deluxe may
have to undertake the filing of the documents and/or handle the majority of the
patenting process without the assistance of a third-party patent agent.]

The following chart details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 25% of
this Offering:

Expenditure Item**                               25%   
Legal Fees                                     $  9,000
Audit Fees                                       10,000
Other Fees (Accounting, transfer agent, etc.)     1,500
Design and Patenting                              2,000
Manufacturing Costs                               2,000
Marketing Expenses                                  NIL
Website Design                                      500
Administrative and Business Development             NIL
Total                                           $25,000

If only 25% of this Offering is sold, the Company will have to strictly limit
its development plans.  It will only utilize attorneys to do what is necessary
to meet its SEC, state and Federal reporting and licensing requirements.  Its
audit requirements will be met at the same level as would be done if 100% of the
stock Offering were sold.  We will look to other less expensive ways of having 
our financials prepared and we will engage our transfer agents for only the most
necessary tasks.  We will look to other more creative ways of hosting our 
website.  Deluxe will utilize social media and find as many free opportunities
as possible to promote and market their product.

Although there is no written agreement, the President has agreed to pay for any
additional expenses as necessary.  Although there is no written agreement, and
no guarantee such a loan will be made, our President is prepared to pay
additional expenses, as necessary, by loaning the Company, on a shareholder loan
basis, up to $100,000 during our first year of operations.

If the Company is unable to raise more than 25% of the Offering, and if it
becomes necessary, the Company’s president will not utilize a third-party
service provider and will instead self-prepare and file the application for a
non-provisional patent.  A budget of $2,000 will only be enough funding to have
drawings prepared to file with the USPTO and actually file the non-provisional
patent application (without utilizing a third-party patent agent to prepare the
application).  Deluxe will have to self-prepare the patent documents and the
Company’s president will be required to create the drawings, application and
undertake the filing the application for a non-provisional patent.  

No proceeds from this Offering will be paid to our sole Officer and Director in
the form of commissions, salary, or other compensation.


We are currently unaware of anyone manufacturing, marketing, supplying or
selling any product similar to our deluxe fishing rod holder. Our limited
research on the internet did not result in the identification of any companies
currently manufacturing and/or supplying a fishing-rod holder similar to the one
we have designed and intend to market and sell.

There are several companies that make and sell fishing rod holders, including
fishing rod holders designed specifically for ice fishing; however, Deluxe has
not yet identified a fishing rod holder currently being manufactured and/or sold
by anyone else that will help set the hook into the fish’s mouth and trigger an
alarm bell notifying the angler that a fish has been hooked. Our limited
research has led us to believe that there are no products currently being
offered similar to our proposed product. Although we have not identified a
product similar to our design, our research has been limited and there could be
a similar product, of which we are currently unaware, being marketed and/or
sold.
 
We have not obtained any empirical evidence detailing the competitive market in
the U.S. and Canada for a rod-holder such as the one we have designed, and we
cannot determine competitive factors with any degree of certainty. We plan on
working with a supplier who already manufactures fishing products. We do not at
this time have any agreements or contracts with a supplier or company that
provides such products.

While we do not have empirical evidence to support our contentions, our limited
research has led us to believe that competitive conditions are favorable.
According to statistics by Statista.com there appears to be correlations
between Wildlife-related recreational expenditures in the U.S. in 2001, 2006,
and 2011 (in the billion U.S. dollars), by category. In 2001, $48.97 billion
was spent on Wildlife watching, $45.43 billion was spent on Fishing, and $26.28
billion was spent on Hunting. In 2006, $51.13 billion was spent on Wildlife
watching, $47.05 billion was spent on Fishing, and $25.64 billion was spent on
Hunting. In 2011, $54.96 billion was spent on Wildlife watching, $41.77 billion
was spent on Fishing, and $33.26 billion was spent on Hunting. In all three
categories from 2001 to 2006 there is 2.5% increase in total sales. In the same
categories from 2006 to 2011 there is 5% increase in total sales. Although
fishing sales dropped in 2011 to $41.77 billion from $47.05 billion in 2006,
total sales of hunting increased to $33.26 billion from where it had dropped to
in 2006. It is estimated that 90.1 million Americans or 38% of the population
participated in wildlife-related recreation in 2011. It was an increase is 2.6
million participants since 2006.  Although we do not have empirical data to
support it: Deluxe considers there to be similarities and possible correlations
between hunting and fishing. Those involved in wildlife-related recreation
spent 130 billion on gear, trips, licenses, tags, and land leasing. More than
33 million people fished in 2011. They spent $41.8 billion on trips, equipment,
licenses and other items, an average of $1,262.00 per angler. Statistics
gathered by the American Fishing Association estimates that the ice fishing
market exceeded $260 Million in 2012, an increase of nearly 10% over 2011.  Our
data is not suggesting that the increase in total sales from 2011 to 2012 are
new anglers; however, it may suggest a relationship with dollars spent in other
wildlife-related recreational categories.  

We believe Deluxe can be among the first companies to introduce such products
into our target market areas. Although we have not discovered that anyone that
produces similar products, there is no guarantee that Deluxe will find success,
or be a product that will be able to compete effectively. We believe we have an
unproven product with no clear or definite understanding of the competitive
factors.  An investment in Deluxe is extremely risky.

There are no immediate or imminent threats to the supply or prices of related
materials due to shortages or other factors that we are aware of at this time.
To our knowledge, at this time there are no government regulations, in the
United States or Canada, that would prohibit or negatively affect Deluxe from
importing or exporting our product(s) into or out of those countries. To our
knowledge, at this time there are no import/export regulations or controls
imposed by any of the potential countries, from which our product(s) could
originate, that would prevent us from obtaining our product(s) or shipping our
products to the U.S. or Canada.  

The Company currently has no employees and has no plans to hire any employees
during its first year of operation. Deluxe intends to use contracted services
to conduct all aspects of its business.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada as DD’s Deluxe Rod Holder, Inc. on
September 26, 2014.

Deluxe has developed a prototype fishing-rod holder for use primarily by
ice-fisherman. On January 30, 2015 the Company filed a provisional patent
application with the United States Patent and


 Trademark Office (“USPTO”).  A
provisional patent application is valid for twelve (12) months from its date of
filing unless extended. A “non-provisional” patent application can be filed at
any time during the 12 month period following the filing of the provisional
application. A “non-provisional” patent application may still be filed within
two (2) months of the expiration of the provisional application upon leave of
the USPTO.  Prior to the expiration of the provisional patent application Deluxe
plans to file a non-provisional application for a utility patent, and thereafter
market the prototype to sporting goods and angling wholesalers as well as
retailers and the general public in the United States and Canada. In order to
obtain a non-provisional utility patent, we intend to retain the services of a
law firm or other third party service provider who specializes in preparing and
filing of patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office. Deluxe does not have any agreements with any companies, suppliers or
manufacturers, nor does it have any agreements with customers to purchase any
products from the Company.

The non-provisional patent application is commonly known as a “utility” patent
application. Filing this application establishes the filing date and begins the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)’s patent review process, which
can take 18 months or more to complete. The non-provisional or “utility” patent
for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office." Moreover; an invention can be
considered property giving the inventor an exclusive right to license it while
retaining ownership, or selling it outright. The non-provisional patent excludes
others from making, using, or selling the patented invention. Having a 
non-provisional patent creates licensing opportunities. Conversely, the 
provisional patent application establishes the filing date but does not start 
the USPTO review process and therefore offers limited protections to the Company
and its product relative to the non-provisional or “utility” patent application.
The provisional patent application provides a limited (when compared to a 
non-provisional application) measure of protection for 12 months from the filing
date and expires unless you file a utility patent application extension before 
the 12 months are up. The provisional application establishes a priority date,
so anyone conceiving the same invention later will not be able to obtain a 
patent (as long as the originator files a full, non-provisional patent 
application within one year of filing the provisional version). The provisional
patent is much more simplified: a written description of the invention is 
required, but claims and drawings are not.  A provisional patent application 
allows us to use the “patent pending” designation for our proposed product and 
upon filing the non-provisional “utility” patent application we will be allowed
to relate back the filing date for the “utility” patent application to the date
we filed the non-provisional patent application. The granting of a “utility”
patent will provide us with the full protection of United States (and 
international) patent laws with respect to our proposed product.

Although the Company has not, to date, retained the services of any patent
assistance service provider, our President, anticipates doing so in the near
future.

Notes to
Financial Statements


September
30, 2016


 

 

 

N OTE 1
- NATURE OF OPERATIONS

 

DD’s
Deluxe Rod Holder, Inc. (“Deluxe” or the
“Company”) was incorporated on September 26, 2014 under
the laws of the State of Nevada.  The business purpose of the
Company is to sell, through its website Deluxerodholder.com, a
fishing rod holder primarily for use the sport of ice fishing.
 The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year
end.

 

NOTE 2 -
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

This
summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist
in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements
and notes are representations of the Company’s management,
which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These
financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

 

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim balance
sheets and statements of operations and cash flows contain all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary to
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The operating and financial results
for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

 

Going
Concern

 

As shown
in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred
operating losses since inception.  As of September 30, 2016,
the Company has no financial resources with which to achieve its
objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows.
 As shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of
operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $91,254 and
the Company's working capital is a negative $53,114.
 Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent
upon the ability to obtain additional financing, and generate
revenue from current and planned business operations, and control
costs.  The Company is in the development stage and has
generated no operating income. The Company plans to fund its future
operations by joint venturing or obtaining additional financing
from investors and/or lenders.  However, there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives,
therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a
going concern exists.  The financial statements do not include
adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor
the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring
the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to valuation
of deferred tax.  Actual results could differ from these
estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the
Company’s reported financial position and results of
operations.

 

New
Accounting Pronouncement

 

In August
2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15—Presentation of
Financial Statements—Going Concern. The guidance requires an
entity’s management to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial
doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the
financial statements are

DD’S
DELUXE ROD HOLDER, INC.

Notes to

available
to be issued when applicable). If conditions or events exist that
raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue
as a going concern, the guidance requires disclosure in the
financial statements. The guidance will be effective for the annual
period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and
interim periods thereafter.  Early application is
permitted. 

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

For the
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.  

 

Start-up
Costs

 

In
accordance with ASC 720-15-20, “Start-up Costs,”
the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the
start-up and organization of the Company.

 

Fair
Value Measurements

 

ASC Topic
820 "Fair Value Measurements" ("ASC 820") requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of
independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to
measure fair value.  A financial instrument's categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC
820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to
measure fair value:

 

Level 1:
 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

 

Level 2:
 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
or liability such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs
are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated
by, observable market data.

 

Level 3:
 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are
unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are
significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had no assets or liabilities
accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.

 

Loss Per
Share

 

Basic
Earnings Per Share ("EPS") is computed as net income (loss)
available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period.

 

Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common
shares issuable through stock options and warrants.  The
Company has no potentially dilutive securities such as options,
warrants, or convertible debt currently issued and outstanding.
 Consequently, basic and diluted earnings per share are the
same, as shown in the Statement of Operations.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company recognizes provision for income tax using the liability
method.  Deferred income tax liabilities or assets at the end
of each period are determined using the tax rates expected to be in
effect when the taxes are

actually
paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred
tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of
these deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 

NOTE 3
– LINE OF CREDIT

 

On March
1, 2016, the Company entered into a short term line of credit
agreement with Crest Business Solutions, LLC (“Crest”).
The agreement provides that Crest will provide the Company with up
to $50,000 via the line of credit.  All amounts borrowed by
the Company pursuant to the line of credit will be due and payable
(with accrued interest thereon) in one balloon payment on February
28, 2017.  The Company has the option to extend the term of
the line of credit for an additional year to February 28, 2018.
 Interest accrues on the principal amount borrowed pursuant to
the line of credit at the rate of five percent per annum.
 Crest previously had made advances to the Company.  As
of March 1, 2016, advances payable of $28,286 were transferred into
the line of credit.

 

As of
September, 30, 2016, the balance of the Line of Credit was $30,449.
 Accrued interest of $1,617 is also recorded.  For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized interest expense of $402 and $1,617, respectively.
   

 

NOTE 4
– STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)

 

Common
Stock

On
February 9, 2016, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of its common
stock at $0.01 per share for a total of $30,000.  

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had 4,000,000 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding with a par value of $0.001 per share.

 MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION. 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This
quarterly report and the exhibits attached hereto contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
 Such forward-looking statements concern the Company’s
anticipated results and developments in the Company’s
operations in future periods, planned exploration and development
of its properties, plans related to its business and other matters
that may occur in the future.  These statements relate to
analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of
future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and
assumptions of management.  

Any
statement that expresses or involves discussions with respect to
predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,
assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always
using words or phrases such as “expects” or “does
not expect”, “is expected”,
“anticipates” or “does not anticipate”,
“plans”, “estimates”, or
“intends”, or states that certain actions, events or
results “may” or “could”,
“would”, “might” or “will” be
taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact
and may be forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking
statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or
results to differ from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements, including, without
limitation:

·

Risks
related to the Company’s business being in the development
stage;

·

Risks
related to the Company being able to continue as a going
concern;

·

Risks
related to the Company’s management residing in
Canada;

·

Risks
related to the Company being headquartered in Canada;

·

Risks
related to the Company’s ability to obtain a non-provisional
patent for its product design;

·

Risks
related to the Company’s competitive
disadvantages;

·

Risks
related to the effects of climate change on the market for the
Company’s proposed product;

·

Risks
related to the possible dilution of the Company’s common
stock from additional financing activities;

·

Risks
related to potential conflicts of interest with the Company’s
management;

·

Risks
related to the Company’s shares of common stock;

This list
is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the
Company’s forward-looking statements.  Some of the
important risks and uncertainties that could affect forward-looking
statements are described further under the sections titled
“Description of Business” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” of this Quarterly Report.
 Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those anticipated,
believed, estimated or expected.  The Company cautions readers
not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date made.  DD’s Deluxe Rod
Holder, Inc. disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events, except as required by law.
 The Company advises readers to carefully review the reports
and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), particularly the
Company’s S-1 Registration Statement, as amended, originally
filed on May 29, 2015, and in the future, its Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form
8-K.

Corporate
Background

DD’s
Deluxe Rod Holder, Inc. (“Deluxe” or the
“Company”) is a Nevada corporation formed on September
26, 2014.  The Company intends to build its business by
developing, marketing and selling a fishing rod holder for use
primarily by ice-fisherman.  On January 30, 2015, the Company
filed a provisional patent application with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).  The
Company’s original provisional patent application was
scheduled to expire on January 30, 2016.  On January 28, 2016
the Company filed a new provisional patent

application
with the USPTO.  On February 24, 2016, the Company converted
the provisional patent application into a non-provisional by filing
a non-provisional patent application, USPTO.  The Company
anticipates the entire process to acquire a non-provisional utility
patent will take between 12-18 months.

Current
Operations

 

The
Company is a developmental stage company.  The Company has
conducted limited operations and have had no operating revenues.
 We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or
involved in any legal action or proceedings.  Since
incorporating, we have not made any significant purchases or sales
of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions
or consolidations.

 

Deluxe is
building a business as a developer and seller of a fishing rod
holder for use primarily for ice fishing.  Although the
fishing rod holder can be used on almost any solid, relatively flat
surface (such as a dock during non-winter months), our primary
target market is ice anglers.  What we refer to as a fishing
rod holder includes a platform base connected to a tube that holds
the rod, a split key ring affixed to an eye bolt, a bent metal
mechanism which we have described as the
“fishing-rod-eyelet-catch,” an optional alarm bell, and
a coarsely-threaded screw which enables the end-user to stabilize
the unit and/or affix the base of the unit to ice, wood, foam,
metal, and a range of other hard surfaces.  When a fish is
hooked, the fishing-rod-eyelet-catch releases from the flexed rod
allowing the stored elastic energy in the flexed rod to expend,
visually alerting the fisherman.  The rod-holder will include
a small metal bell and fisherman will have the option to attach it
to the rod which will further alert the angler when a fish is
hooked and the rod is released from the eyelet-catch.  The
eyelet-catch is a bendable metal rod which allows the fisherman to
adjust the sensitivity of the catch system: a decrease in the angle
of the eyelet-catch makes the system more sensitive, and an
increase in the angle of the eyelet-catch makes it less sensitive.
 A more sensitive eyelet-catch will make it easier for small
fish to disengage the eyelet-catch; and a less sensitive
eyelet-catch will make it more difficult to disengage the fishing
rod enabling only larger fish to do so.

 

Believing
the design of our product is eligible for a utility patent, we have
filed a non-provisional patent application with the USPTO.
 The Company self-filed the non-provisional patent application
via the USPTO’s online electronic filing system.  The
filing date, February 24, 2016, establishes the “date”
of invention and, if a utility patent is ultimately issued,
precludes any opposing claims to the invention subsequent to that
date.  The USPTO will respond to the Company by either
notifying the Company that its application is incomplete, or the
application will be assigned internally within the USPTO to undergo
the examination process.  If the application is incomplete the
USPTO will provide the Company with a list of deficiencies and the
Company will be given an opportunity to correct those deficiencies.
 Once the application is complete and assigned to an examiner,
the examiner will make an initial determination as to whether our
proposed product is eligible for the issuance of a utility patent.
 If the examiner initially determines that our proposed
product is not eligible to receive a utility patent, the examiner
will issue a determination to that effect and explain to the
Company the bases for the examiner’s determination.  The
Company will then have an opportunity to amend its application
and/or respond to the examiner’s bases for its determination.
 If the examiner determines that our proposed product is
eligible for patent protection then the examiner will issue a
notice of allowance which will contain further instructions to
complete the process to issue the utility patent covering our
proposed product.  If we are successful in obtaining a utility
patent for our proposed product, that patent will grant us certain
rights regarding the proposed product, including, but not
necessarily limited to the rights to, for a period of at least
twenty (20) years: exclude others from making, using, selling,
offering for sale, importing, or otherwise utilizing, our proposed
product without our specific consent.  The Company expects it
will take at least 12-18 months to obtain a non-provisional utility
patent for our proposed product.  

 

During
the next twelve (12) months the Company will work toward
identifying and engaging a manufacturer to produce our product and
also identifying one or more sporting goods and/or angling
equipment wholesaler and/or retailers with which to place our
product for sale to the general public.  We will not make any
agreements with wholesalers, retailers, or manufacturers until we
have achieved success in obtaining a non-provisional utility patent
for our proposed product.  We will likely not place any orders
with a manufacturer unless and until we have received advance
orders of our product from wholesalers and/or retailers.  We
currently do not have any agreements with a manufacturer or with
any wholesalers or product retailers.  We foresee delivering
product to retailers and/or wholesalers within the next twenty-four
(24) months.

Upon, and
only if, the Company obtains a non-provisional
“utility” patent for its proposed product, and after we
have sourced a manufacturer to make our proposed product, we will
begin marketing our proposed product to wholesalers, retailers and
the general public.  Our marketing plan will include online
search optimization, utilization of a Company website, production
and dissemination of hard copy and electronic promotional materials
and direct marketing efforts to retailers and wholesalers and trade
show attendees.

 

We likely
will not place any orders to manufacture our proposed product until
we receive advanced sales orders from wholesalers and/or retailers.
 At this time, it is impossible to effectively market our
product and to know how l
