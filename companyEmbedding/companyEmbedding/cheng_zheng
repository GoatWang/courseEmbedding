Systems Research Group (Asia)








We live in an exciting time for systems research given the explosion of digital data mined from our world and social relationships, new experiences such as cloud computing and the mobile Internet, and incredible advances in computing devices, storage media, and connectivity. We engage in fundamental systems research with expertise that spans theory and practice in distributed systems, storage systems, cloud computing, networking, and programming languages. Over the years, we have designed, built, analyzed, and optimized various large-scale production distributed systems that power on-line services. These experiences have inspired a series of research projects, producing significant results in top systems conferences such as SOSP, OSDI, NSDI, Eurosys, and VLDB.
 



PASS: Program Analysis for SCOPE Scripts
PASS project is a continuing collaboration with the Cosmos team that aims to improve SCOPE script correctness and performance using program analysis techniques, following the inter-disciplinary research direction, among program language, system and database research.

Temporal Graph Storage and Analysis of Social Data
An explosion of user-generated data from online social networks motivates analysis to extract deep insights from this data’s graph of social, temporal, spatial, and topical connections. We are building a system to enable storage and analysis of such graphs that considers their evolution over time as trending topics and social activities change.

TimeStream: Large-Scale Real-Time Stream Processing in the Cloud
TimeStream is a distributed system designed specifically for low-latency continuous processing of big streaming data on a large cluster of commodity machines. The unique characteristics of this emerging application domain have led to a significantly different design from the popular MapReduce-style batch data processing. In particular, we advocate a powerful new abstraction called resilient substitution that caters to the specific needs in this new computation model.

MadLINQ: Large-Scale Distributed Matrix Computation for the Cloud
The computation core of many data-intensive applications can be best expressed as matrix computations. The MadLINQ project addresses the following two important research problems: the need for a highly scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant matrix computation system that is also easy to program, and the seamless integration of such specialized execution engines in a general purpose data-parallel computing system.

Robust Distributed System Nucleus (rDSN)



					Established: May 15, 2015				

				Robust Distributed System Nucleus (rDSN) is an open framework for quickly building and managing high performance and robust distributed systems. The core idea is a coherent and principled design that distributed systems, tools, and frameworks can be developed independently and later on integrated (almost) transparently.  Developed by System Research Group of Microsoft Research Asia, Robust Distributed System Nucleus (rDSN), is now open source on GitHub.com. rDSN is an open framework for developers,…			






MODIST: Transparent Model Checking of Unmodified Cloud Systems



					Established: March 8, 2014				

				MODIST is a practical software model checker for unmodified concurrent, distributed and cloud systems. MODIST explores different execution paths systematically as well as simulating a variety of environment faults to discover subtle corner-case defects. We have applied MODIST in Oracle Berkely DB, MPS(Paxos implementation), SQL Azure, Windows Azure Storage and other real systems, and found many new bugs. 			






Live Programming



					Established: March 2, 2014				

				Programming today involves editing code while also running it in our head. To augment this mental simulation, live programming promises for much more fluid feedback between the programmer and a program that is executing while it is being edited. A PL designer used to be able to design some syntax and semantics for their language, implement a compiler, and then call it a day. Today, however, languages are supported by sophisticated environments that, when designed together with languages, have…
