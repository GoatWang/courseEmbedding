Arista Networks Inc (ANET) Stock Is Set To Ride IoT Into The Cloud


						View All Posts
					








Arista Networks Inc (NASDAQ:ANET) has been on a pretty stunning ride in the past 12 months, up more than 120%. Investors might think that after a monster move like that, it may not be time to think about buying. But the amazing thing is, ANET stock is just starting its rise.

What’s happening now in cloud computing space is reminiscent of what was happening in the dotcom world in the mid- to late 1990s, especially in regard to the rise of router company Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), currently ANET’s most significant competitor.
Routers were the backbone of the internet and the web would not function as an invertebrate. To store, host and move the massive amounts of data that the internet almost-exponentially produced every quarter, you had to have fast, reliable and efficient routers. And CSCO became the go-to firm that committed its resources to building out the infrastructure of the internet.
Today, this analogy applies to cloud computing. And Arista is the change agent.
Go-To Cloud Server
Name a technology growth segment — internet of things (IoT), online gaming, virtual reality, big data, smartphones, smart cars, streaming video and music — and you’re looking at reliance on the cloud. ANET is becoming the go-to server company for cloud computing.
What’s the difference between the cloud and the internet? The cloud allows data to be stored remotely so we don’t have to lug around mobile devices with massive hard drives attached to them to run programs and store data.
It allows us to watch movies on our phones, or work on a presentation with your team while everyone is spread across the country.
One way to look at it is in data size and flow. An exabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes. Today, mobile data traffic is slightly less than 9 exabytes. In a recent article in Computerworld, telecommunications giant Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) predicted that by 2022, traffic will grow to 71 exabytes.  That’s a nearly eight-fold increase in the next five years.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our
      future performance, including statements in the section entitled
      “Financial Outlook,” such as estimates regarding revenue, non-GAAP gross
      margin and non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal
      2017, statements regarding the adoption of cloud networking by our
      customers at an unprecedented pace, and statements regarding the
      benefits from the introduction of Arista AlgoMatch™ and the Arista 7160
      Series platforms. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of
      uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements
      including risks associated with: Arista Networks’ limited operating
      history; risks associated with Arista Networks’ rapid growth; Arista
      Networks’ customer concentration; Arista Networks’ dispute with Cisco
      Systems, Inc. including Arista Networks’ ability to obtain a
      determination that alternative product implementations are not covered
      by remedial orders and our ability to manage our manufacturing and
      supply chain including the sourcing of components on commercially
      reasonable terms, if at all; risks associated with our customer’s
      adoption of our redesigned products and services and requests for more
      favorable terms and conditions; declines in the sales prices of our
      products and services; changes in customer order patterns or customer
      mix; increased competition in our products and service markets,
      including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and
      market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid
      technological and market change; the evolution of the cloud networking
      market and the adoption by end customers of Arista Networks’ cloud
      networking solutions; Arista’s dispute with OptumSoft; and general
      market, political, economic and business conditions. Additional risks
      and uncertainties that could affect Arista Networks can be found in
      Arista’s Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November
      3, 2016, and other filings that the company makes to the SEC from time
      to time. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.arista.com
      and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
      All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on
      information available to the company as of the date hereof and Arista
      Networks disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any
      forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances
      that exist after the date on which they were made.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      The company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
      stock-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the OptumSoft
      and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The company uses
      these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial
      results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures
      is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing
      operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the
      primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and
      forecasting for future periods.
    

      Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation
      or as a substitute for comparable GAAP net income, net income per
      diluted share, gross margin, or operating margin. Non-GAAP financial
      measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in
      conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements
      prepared in accordance with GAAP. A description of these non-GAAP
      financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP
      financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has
      been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press
      release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.
    

      The Company’s guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes
      stock-based compensation, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and
      Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The Company has not
      reconciled its non-GAAP gross margin or its non-GAAP operating margin
      guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin, because we do
      not provide guidance on GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin or
      the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP gross
      margin and GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP
      operating margin. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the
      Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair
      market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to
      predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of stock-based
      compensation in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 will have a significant
      impact on the Company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin.
      Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance
      to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable
      effort.

Arista Networks (previously Arastra[2]) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include an array of 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet low-latency cut-through switches, including the 7124SX,[3] which remained the fastest switch[4] using SFP+ optics through September 2012,[5] with its sub-500ns latency, as well as the 7500 series, Arista’s award-winning[6] modular 10G/40G/100Gbit/s switch. Arista's own Linux-based network operating system, EOS (Extensible Operating System), runs on all Arista products.

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]

Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]

All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.

Arista Networks (previously Arastra[2]) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include an array of 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet low-latency cut-through switches, including the 7124SX,[3] which remained the fastest switch[4] using SFP+ optics through September 2012,[5] with its sub-500ns latency, as well as the 7500 series, Arista’s award-winning[6] modular 10G/40G/100Gbit/s switch. Arista's own Linux-based network operating system, EOS (Extensible Operating System), runs on all Arista products.

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

Arista Networks (previously Arastra[2]) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include an array of 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet low-latency cut-through switches, including the 7124SX,[3] which remained the fastest switch[4] using SFP+ optics through September 2012,[5] with its sub-500ns latency, as well as the 7500 series, Arista’s award-winning[6] modular 10G/40G/100Gbit/s switch. Arista's own Linux-based network operating system, EOS (Extensible Operating System), runs on all Arista products.

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

Arista Networks (previously Arastra[2]) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include an array of 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet low-latency cut-through switches, including the 7124SX,[3] which remained the fastest switch[4] using SFP+ optics through September 2012,[5] with its sub-500ns latency, as well as the 7500 series, Arista’s award-winning[6] modular 10G/40G/100Gbit/s switch. Arista's own Linux-based network operating system, EOS (Extensible Operating System), runs on all Arista products.

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

Arista Networks (previously Arastra[2]) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include an array of 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet low-latency cut-through switches, including the 7124SX,[3] which remained the fastest switch[4] using SFP+ optics through September 2012,[5] with its sub-500ns latency, as well as the 7500 series, Arista’s award-winning[6] modular 10G/40G/100Gbit/s switch. Arista's own Linux-based network operating system, EOS (Extensible Operating System), runs on all Arista products.

Corporate history[edit]
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]
In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]
In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13] As a result of the first lawsuit, the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco [14] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[15] The decision is being appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Products[edit]
Extensible Operating System[edit]
EOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as a single image that runs across all Arista devices[16] or in a virtual machine.[17] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel under a Fedora-based userland.[18] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching ASICs, the CLI, SNMP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, the damage is limited to a single agent.[19][20] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[20] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).
The fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or usual configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive APIs to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[21] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[22] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.
Programmability[edit]
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[23] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[24]
eAPI (External API)[25] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.

Ethernet switches[edit]
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[26] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[27] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for up to 2048 10GbE ports.[28] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[29]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the frame size.[4]

The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[30] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[31]


7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[32] Unlike the 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[33] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[34]

The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[35] (largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[36] or RBC Capital Markets.[37] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[38]
Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[39] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.
All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[40] which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[41] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system (including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.
In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[42]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
