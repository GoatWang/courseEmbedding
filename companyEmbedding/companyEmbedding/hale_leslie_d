Courrèges parts ways with creative directors

Thursday, July 20 2017 



French fashion house Courrèges on Thursday stated it is parting ways with
its design duo Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant.


Meyer and Vaillant were only in the role for four seasons, or two years,
and left by mutual agreement.


“They have accomplished the goal to reinterpret the house codes and
distinctive shapes that are synonym of the brand uniqueness and innovative
spirit,” the house said in a statement. “The two designers will now focus
on new creative projects.”


François Le Ménahèze, appointed president of Courrèges in April, will
reveal the brand’s new creative leadership, the statement said.


In 2015 Artémis SA, French billionaire François Pinault’s family holding
company, acquired a 30 percent stake in the company. At the time Courrèges
staged its first catwalk show after a 13 year hiatus, marking the debut of
Meyer and Vaillant as artistic directors of women’s wear.

Katie Grand joins W Magazine after Enninful departure

Thursday, July 20 2017 



W Magazine have announced British stylist Katie Grand as its new
contributing fashion editor. Grand takes over from Edward Enninful who
begins as the new editor in chief of British Vogue next month.


Grand, who will maintain her role as editor in chief of biannual
publication Love Magazine, a fashion bible she founded and is also
published by Condé Nast, stated: " I've bought W since I first started
buying magazines. It's a great American magazine with so much fantastic
history."


Grand will style fashion stories and work alongside W's editor in chief
Stefano Tonchi. Grand is thought to have been in the running to replace
Shulman, but was pipped to the post by Enninful, a successful editor and
stylist in his own right.


Tonchi told Business of Fashion: "A lot of people don't want to pinned down
in a specific place," citing Grand's many projects across editorial
(contributing to Vogue Paris and Italia) and advertising (for Louis
Vuitton, Prada, Miu Miu, Loewe) and creative partnership with Marc Jacobs.
"I started thinking about a structure that would let talent come in and
give their best, and also to have a more kind of reliable core here at the
magazine."


W magazine was first published in 1971 and was purchased by Condé Nast from
Fairchild Publications in 1999. The magazine is an oversized format, larger
than standard magazines and has a circulation of approximately 500,000.

Thursday, July 20 2017 


Former Chanel chief executive Maureen Chiquet has been nominated to the
Canada Goose board of directors as an independent director.
Outerwear specialist Canada Goose states that Chiquet will bring a
“global vision, international leadership and deep luxury acumen” to the
board, as the brand continues its global expansion that includes the
opening of its first European flagship store in London this autumn.
“Maureen is a highly-regarded industry trailblazer and we are thrilled
to welcome her to our team as we grow our Board with the right people and
the right skills to help us leverage the opportunities that lie ahead,”
said Dani Reiss, president and chief executive of Canada Goose. “Her deep
expertise in growing businesses on an international scale, and extensive
track record of sustaining brand excellence will be invaluable as we
continue to expand our global footprint and build an enduring legacy.”
Chiquet, who was Chanel’s first global chief executive overseeing the
business and brand’s world-wide expansion for nearly a decade, brings more
than 30 years of retail industry experience to the Canada Goose board and
is expected to provide strong product, marketing, and business operations
expertise.
“I have long admired Canada Goose for its dedication to authenticity,
quality and craftsmanship and I am honoured to be a part of such a highly
coveted global brand as it embarks on its next chapter of growth. I look
forward to joining this winning team and to supporting Canada Goose’s
exciting future,” added Chiquet.
Chiquet will be nominated for election to the Board of Directors at
Canada Goose’s Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled to take place on
August 15 in Toronto.











Karren Brady to chair Arcadia’s parent company




Danielle Wightman-Stone |



Tuesday, July 18 2017 


Baroness Karren Brady, the boss of West Ham United and a judge on
reality TV show The Apprentice, has been appointed as non-executive
chairman of Taveta, the parent company of Sir Philip Green’s fashion
retailer empire Arcadia. 
Brady will replace Lord Grabiner as non-executive chairman immediately,
as he has announced that he is stepping down from the board after 15 years.
Grabiner was heavily criticised by a committee of MPs with regard to the
collapse of BHS for his “weak corporate governance”. 
In a statement Sir Philip Green said: “I am delighted to announce that
Baroness Karren Brady will be appointed as non-executive Chairman. Baroness
Brady joined the Taveta Board as a non-executive Director in September 2010
and will assume the role immediately.” 
Taveta names Baroness Karren Brady as non-executive chairman
Taveta is the Green family firm, owned by the retail mogul and his wife
Tina that controls Arcadia, the umbrella company that owns fashion chains
Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Burton, Wallis,
and Outfit. Arcadia has an annual turnover in excess of 2 billion pounds
and employs more than 24,000 people globally. 
Commenting on her appointment, Brady said: “It is a privilege to have
been invited to chair the Board and I look forward to working with my
colleagues as we concentrate on driving the Arcadia brands forward on their
global expansion.” 
Brady takes over as chair at a tricky time for the retail group as it
recently reported lower sales and profits with falling sales and increased
costs linked to the collapse of BHS. Taveta reported that pre-tax profits
for the Arcadia group plummeted from 172 million pounds to 37 million
pounds in the year ended August 27, 2016, with total turnover down 17
percent to 2.02 billion pounds.

20 years after Gianni's murder, Versace has rediscovered its soul




AFP |



Friday, July 14 2017 


Twenty years ago, stylist Gianni Versace was
gunned down in Miami, plunging his fashion house into crisis. Two decades
on,
it is one of the world's top global luxury brands thanks to his little
sister,
Donatella.

He had gone out for the morning papers: as Versace returned to his Miami
beach mansion on July 15, 1997, he was shot dead by Andrew Cunanan, a
homosexual prostitute known for his obsession with all things luxury.
The fashion world mourned deeply. The stylist to celebrities from Madonna
to Elton John had been just 50 years old.

"He was a 360-degrees creator, a real artist, he had a pure creative
vision
on colours and materials," Stefania Saviolo, director of the luxury and
fashion centre at Bocconi University, told AFP In Milan.
The group he had created with his brother Santo in 1978 had been one of
the
hottest fashion brands in the world.

It fell to Versace's platinum blonde sister Donatella -- to whom Gianni
had
entrusted the casual line Versus -- to take over as artistic director.
But the brand struggled to recover from Versace's murder. Donatella, who
had worked for 14 years alongside Gianni, was severely affected by the loss
of
her brother and confessed to feeling "vulnerable".

Depression and cocaine 

"You can't invent yourself as an artistic director overnight," says
Saviolo, particularly as Donatella took over "at a time when fashion was
changing a lot, with many collections and great pressure on artistic
directors".

Donatella, instantly recognisable for her famous locks and perpetual tan,
sank into a period of depression and cocaine use before detoxifying in 2005.
The year before, the brand had acquired a new CEO in Giancarlo Di Risio.
The former Fendi boss refocused the Medusa on the luxury market,
streamlining
licensing and franchising deals and developing the accessories range.

Amid rumours in the press of a fall-out between the family and Di Risio
over planned cuts, he was replaced in 2009 by Gian Giacomo Ferraris, who
moved
over from the Jil Sander fashion house.
Ferraris wasted no time in launching an extensive reorganisation plan to
return Versace to profitability, cutting 25 percent of its workforce and
closing some boutiques before opening new ones as the books improved.

His intervention "doubled the turnover, which rose from 268 million euros
in 2009 to 645 million in 2015," according to David Pambianco, who heads up
a
consultancy company in his name.
By 2011 the historic brand had returned to profit after a gruelling three
years of losses.


'So much potential'

"The right balance was struck between Ferraris and Donatella, the
dialogue
between them was good and there was great respect for Donatella's creativity
and vision," Saviolo said.
The family, which had always refused to relinquish control to a luxury
conglomerate like so many of its fellow Italian fashion houses, finally
yielded a 20 percent stake in 2014 to the US private equity firm
Blackstone.

The move, which Donatella said would allow Versace to "achieve its
potential", resulted in a cash injection into the luxury designer and
boosted
its presence in emerging markets.
The bet paid off: despite a difficult global context, sales increased by
some 17 percent in 2014 and in 2015.

The house said it was time to "move onto the next phase" and Ferraris was
replaced in May 2016 by Jonathan Akeroyd, former CEO of Alexander McQueen.
Results last year were mixed, with sales up 3.7 percent to 668 million
euros but the company admitting a loss of 7.4 million euros due in
particular
to funds sunk into its network of boutiques.

These results "have caused some uncertainty", but "the company is
healthy,
certainly more than 10 years ago," said Pambianco.
"Versace remains one of the most beautiful brands in the world in the
luxury sector" and has "still so much potential to express", he said,
pointing
out that luxury house Gucci for example "has a turnover that is seven times
higher".

Saviolo agrees: "Versace has recovered its lost "red carpet DNA" and its
style is currently "very daring, very strong." (AFP)
