            If you are thinking of consolidating existing borrowing you should be aware that if you are extending the term of the debt you may be increasing the total amount you repay. All loans are subject to status, and appropriate lending terms.
        

            THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE SECURING OTHER DEBTS AGAINST YOUR HOME. YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR ANY OTHER DEBT SECURED ON IT.

Objective Advice

Central Trust is a fiduciary, which means we always look out for your best interests. We are legally and ethically bound to put the administration of your account before any other interests in our business. Our relationship managers will provide you with unbiased advice, guidance and recommendations.



Estate Planning

A carefully prepared estate plan will allow you to achieve a number of different goals, from ensuring the financial security of your spouse to determining what should be left to your children. With you at the helm, our estate planning specialists can help you and your advisors design a plan to fulfill your objectives and develop the best estate plan for you and your family.


Investment Management

Investment management covers a broad range of services, including building an appropriate portfolio and regularly monitoring its progress.



Trust Services

The primary duty of a trustee is to faithfully carry out your wishes as defined in a trust agreement. This involves investing assets; making payments and distributions; interpreting the terms of the trust; keeping accurate records; and providing regular accounting statements to beneficiaries. The complexity of these tasks is the reason many people choose Central Trust Company to serve as their trustee. Others chose to name themselves or family members as co-trustees with Central Trust – or name us as successor trustee. Our goal is to carry out your wishes and to help you navigate these waters smoothly.



Transfer Planning

Having a plan to pass your wealth on, whether during or after your life, will take stress off family members and ensure that your wishes are carried out.



Retirement Planning

A review of your assets and your plan can provide you with peace of mind that your wealth will last through retirement.



Insurance Analysis

Products and services offered by Central Trust Company are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits of or guaranteed by any depository institution or affiliate bank and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested. Insurance products are available through and underwritten by non-affiliated insurance companies.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.
