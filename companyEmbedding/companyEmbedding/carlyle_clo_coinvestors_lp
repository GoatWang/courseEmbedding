Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

Structured Credit










 









 Overview


The Structured Credit team invests in corporate loans and bonds through structured vehicles and managed accounts. Linda Pace oversees the U.S. Structured Credit team and Colin Atkins oversees the European Structured Credit team.



 Investment Approach
The Carlyle Structured Credit team generally focuses on performing senior secured bank loans rated below investment grade in the U.S. and European markets. Investment professionals practice a disciplined, anticipatory investment approach that is focused on identifying investment opportunities and proactively managing credit and market risk. Through stringent credit selection and monitoring, the team seeks to avoid defaults and maximize recoveries. The team also engages in active trading to improve credit quality. Carlyle Structured Credit strives to achieve high current income from quarterly or semi-annual cash distributions.
The Structured Credit team has long-standing close relationships with arrangers of leveraged finance and secondary market makers, and also has the benefit of Carlyle’s extensive network and strong relationships with the financial community. The team sources assets from both the primary and secondary market and has deal flow relationships with all major counterparties active in the U.S. and European leveraged finance markets, as well as strong relationships with nearly all private equity sponsors in these regions.
Carlyle Structured Credit's investment approach is highlighted as follows:
Leverage the investment team's demonstrated analytical, trading and investment management expertise with The Carlyle Group’s superior industry, company and market knowledge.
Source investment ideas through The Carlyle Group's extensive industry relationships and network of contacts.
Invest in quality companies that offer high current income with a low risk of principal loss using fundamental credit analysis.
Construct and actively manage portfolio asset allocations based upon fund objectives and expectations for macro economic performance.
