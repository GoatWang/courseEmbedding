This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

What are analysts saying about Guidewire Software stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Guidewire Software stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Guidewire Software, Inc., incorporated on September 20, 2001, is a provider of software products for property and casualty (P&C) insurers. The Company's software serves as a technology platform for P&C insurance carriers. The Company's Insurance Platform consists of three elements: core transaction processing, data management and analytics, and digital engagement. The Company sells its products to a range of global P&C insurance carriers ranging from global insurers to national carriers to regional carriers.  It's core transaction processing includes Guidewire InsuranceSuite, Guidewire PolicyCenter, Guidewire ClaimCenter, Guidewire BillingCenter and InsuranceSuite Add-on Modules.   The Company's data management and analytics includes Guidewire DataHub, Guidewire InfoCenter, Guidewire Live and Guidewire Predictive Analytics.   " (7/12/2017)
2. UBS AG analysts commented, "GWRE's FQ2 earnings report came in better than expected across all key metrics ' revenues $116M vs. Street $109M, operating margin 25% vs. Street 14%, EPS $0.28 vs. Street $0.14, and cash from operations $43M vs. Street $21M. The important takeaway from the quarter, in our view, is that GWRE is expecting to see heightened seasonality this FY ' we believe that there are multiple Tier 1 carrier transactions (both expansions and net-new logos) in its pipeline that should come through in the next couple of quarters. GWRE noted in its initial FY17 outlook (Sept. 8th 2016) that its pipeline was filled with Tier 1 expansion deals after the surge of net new Tier 1 wins it saw in F4Q15/F1Q16 ' it is now past the ~18 month time frame that it has taken prior large customer expansions (Nationwide) to occur. We continue to view GWRE as the hands down leader in its P&C insurance vertical, and see upside to our $72 PT as it executes through FY17 margin headwinds and continues its strong upmarket momentum."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Guidewire Software (NYSE:GWRE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.75)Consensus Price Target: $74.50 (4.08% upside)
