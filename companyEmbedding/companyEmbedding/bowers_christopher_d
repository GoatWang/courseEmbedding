Christopher D. Bowers



















Dallas City Attorney










Christopher D. Bowers







First Assistant City Attorney
Chris Bowers joined  the Dallas City Attorney’s office in 1990. For five years, he advised the city  council, city boards, and staff on land use, historic preservation, and  administrative law issues. Since 1995, he has practiced civil trial and  appellate law with an emphasis on property matters, including eminent domain,  zoning, and contracts. In 2001, he took over a regulatory takings case on  appeal and obtained a reversal of a $6.4 million judgment against Dallas.  In 2002,  the U.S. Supreme Court granted his petition for certiorari in a tow truck  regulation case and vacated the Fifth Circuit’s adverse judgment.  In  2005, he convinced the Dallas Court of Appeals to affirm a trial court’s ruling  that Dallas’ denial of a demolition permit for a historic building did not  result in a taking of property rights.  In 2006, he persuaded the Texas  Supreme Court to reverse the court of appeals and the trial court and to uphold  the Dallas  board of adjustment’s denial of a variance.  In 2005, he became the chief  of litigation for Dallas,  and in 2007 he became the first assistant city attorney.
