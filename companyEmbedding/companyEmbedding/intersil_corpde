You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Except for historical information, the discussions in this section contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed below.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements relating to expected future results and business trends of Intersil Corporation ("Intersil" which may also be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") that are based upon our current estimates, expectations, assumptions, and projections about our industry, as well as upon certain views and beliefs held by management, that are "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

In addition, any statements that refer to our pending merger with Renesas Electronics Corporation ("Renesas") as well as other expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:  � risks and uncertainties associated with the pending merger with Renesas, including that various conditions of the merger may not be satisfied or waived, regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the merger, or the merger may not otherwise be consummated for any reason;  � industry and global economic and market conditions, such as the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products and our customers' products;  � global economic weakness, including insufficient credit available for our customers to purchase our products;  � successful development of new products;  � demand for, and market acceptance of, new and existing products;  � the timing of new product introductions and new product performance and quality;  � manufacturing difficulties, such as the availability, cost, and extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity and raw materials;  � the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;  � pricing pressures and other competitive factors, such as competitors' new products;  � changes in product mix;  � product obsolescence;  � legal challenges to our products and technology, such as intellectual property infringement and misappropriation claims;  � the ability to service our customers;  � the need for additional capital;  � legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes, or changes in their interpretation;  � the ability to develop and implement new technologies and to obtain protection of the related intellectual property;  � the extent and timing that customers order and use our products and services in their production or business;  � competitors with significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources;  � fluctuations in manufacturing yields;  � procurement shortage;  � transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as natural disasters, wars, and terrorist activities;  � changes in import or export regulations; and  � exchange rate fluctuations.

Critical Accounting Policies  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the previous disclosures in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2016.  Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in Leases (Topic 840) and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU affects entities that issue equity-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for equity-based payment award transactions which include income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeiture rate calculations. ASU 2016-09 will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.  In April 2016, FASB issued an update to ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606:  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Pending Merger with Renesas Electronics Corporation  On September 12, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Renesas Electronics Corporation, a Japanese corporation ("Renesas"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Renesas will merge with and into Intersil (the "Merger"), with Intersil continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Renesas. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Intersil, other than shares held by stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under Delaware law, and certain shares owned by Intersil, Renesas and their subsidiaries, will be automatically converted into the right to receive $22.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, plus, if applicable, the amount of any dividend which has a record date prior to the closing date of the Merger but remains unpaid as of the closing date of the Merger.  The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and Renesas, including if a governmental body prohibits the Merger or if the Merger is not consummated before July 12, 2017. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we or Renesas will be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $96.5 million. For additional details on the transaction, refer to the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as an Exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 13, 2016.  We recorded transaction-related costs of $4.6 million, principally for outside financial advisory, legal, and related fees and expenses associated with the pending acquisition in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Additional transaction-related costs are expected to be incurred through the closing of the Merger.

Revenue from the industrial and infrastructure end market increased by 7.8% compared to the quarter ended October 2, 2015 with automotive and aerospace end markets exhibiting strong growth. Revenue from the consumer and computing end market increased by 9.3% helped by introduction of new products. In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the favorable impact from changes in average selling prices, or ASPs, increased revenue by $2.7 million, and higher overall unit demand also increased revenue by $7.9 million.  Revenue increased by $7.3 million, or 1.9%, to $402.3 million during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 from $395.0 million during the three quarters ended October 2, 2015. Revenue from the industrial and infrastructure end market decreased by 0.5% compared to the three quarters ended October 2, 2015, while revenue from the consumer and computing end market increased by 6.5% helped by new product introductions. In the three quarters ended September 30, 2016, higher overall unit demand increased revenue by $31.3 million, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from changes in ASPs, which decreased revenue by $24.0 million.  We expect revenue to grow in the future driven by demand for new automotive and infrastructure power products in the industrial and infrastructure end markets, combined with new product ramps for our mobile power products in the consumer and computing end markets.  Geographical revenue ($ in thousands and % of revenue):   Quarter Ended Three Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 October 2, 2015 September 30, 2016 October 2, 2015 Asia $ 98,279 70.7 % $ 96,635 75.3 % $ 288,050 71.6 % $ 272,900 69.1 % North America 25,691 18.5 20,872 16.3 72,990 18.1 70,091 17.7 Europe and other 15,075 10.8 10,889 8.4 41,293 10.3 51,999 13.2 Total $ 139,045 100.0 % $ 128,396 100.0 % $ 402,333 100.0 % $ 394,990 100.0 %  One distributor that supports a wide range of customers around the world accounted for 20.1% and 20.9% of our revenue during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively, and 18.7% and 21.6% of our revenue during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  Cost of revenue consists primarily of purchased materials and services, labor, overhead, and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold.  As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 60.6% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 59.2% during the quarter ended October 2, 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold.  As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 59.6% during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 compared to 59.5% during the three quarters ended October 2, 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold.  Table of Contents  Operating Costs and Expenses  Research and Development ("R&D")  R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product/process research, design and development activities, as well as related subcontracting activities, masks, design automation software, engineering wafers, and technology license agreement expenses.  R&D expenses increased marginally by 0.2% to $31.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $31.2 million during the quarter ended October 2, 2015.  R&D expenses increased by 2.9% to $99.2 million during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016, compared to $96.4 million during the three quarters ended October 2, 2015, mainly due to higher variable compensation expense.  Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A")  SG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing of our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources, finance, information systems, legal, executive, and other administrative functions.  SG&A expenses decreased by 3.2% to $22.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $23.5 million during the quarter ended October 2, 2015, mainly due to reduction in facilities expenses offset by higher variable compensation expense.  SG&A expenses decreased by 3.5% to $71.6 million during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 from $74.2 million during the three quarters ended October 2, 2015. The three quarters ended October 2, 2015 included termination pay of $1.1 million which did not recur in the three quarters ended September 30, 2016. In addition, spending on legal and professional services was lower in the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 offset by higher variable compensation expense.  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles  Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased to $2.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $3.8 million during the quarter ended October 2, 2015 and decreased to $9.1 million during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 from $13.4 million during the three quarters ended October 2, 2015. These decreases were a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016, offset partially by an increase in amortization related to intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Great Wall Semiconductor Corporation on September 8, 2015.  Restructuring and related costs  On June 29, 2016, we began implementation of a plan to decommission our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication line in Palm Bay, Florida or the 200mm Line. The investment in the 200mm Line was made approximately four years ago to address the need to extend the production life of certain products manufactured at a third party wafer foundry when the supply commitments from the supplier for these products were set to expire at the end of 2014. In July 2015, the supplier was acquired and the acquirer recently decided to continue long-term support for the manufacturing of these products. To avoid the future capital investment anticipated to be required for the 200mm Line, we determined it would be beneficial to our long-term cost structure to source the manufacturing for these products from this supplier and decommission our 200mm Line. Due to this shift in manufacturing to an outside provider, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.9 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016 on these long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line. The impairment charge was calculated as the excess of the assets' carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets. We also recorded impairment charges of $1 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016 for specific inventory items related to the 200 mm Line which had no alternative use. In addition we recorded $2.5 million of severance and other employee benefit costs in the quarter ended July 1, 2016 related to the decommissioning and other cost reduction actions. We have entered into an agreement for sale of these assets and received an advance of $2.5 million. We expect to complete the sale within next twelve months.  Table of Contents  Provision for the TAOS litigation  Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions, Inc., or TAOS, named us as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on November 25, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In this action, TAOS alleged four claims consisting of patent infringement, breach of contract, trade secret misappropriation, and tortious interference with a business relationship. On March 6, 2015, the jury found in favor of TAOS on each of the four claims. After certain post-trial motions were heard, the court entered a final judgment on June 9, 2016 against us in the amount of $77.3 million plus court costs and a continuing royalty on certain products found to be infringing TAOS' patent. On June 10, 2016, we filed a notice of appeal; TAOS filed a notice of cross-appeal. Our opening brief is due to be filed on October 28, 2016.  As a consequence of the jury's verdict, during the quarter ended April 3, 2015, we recorded a provision of $81.1 million related to this matter, including pre-judgment interest and estimated legal costs. As a result of the entry of the June 9, 2016 judgment, we increased our accrual for this matter by $1.3 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016. Given the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation and because the outcome remains subject to appeal, the ultimate impact of this lawsuit may be materially different from our estimate.  Gain (loss) on Investments, net  We have a liability for a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. We maintain a portfolio of $10 million in mutual fund investments and corporate-owned life insurance under the plan. Changes in the fair value of the plan assets are recorded as a gain or loss on deferred compensation investments and changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded as a component of compensation expense. In general, the compensation expense or benefit is substantially offset by the gains and losses on the investment.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a gain of $0.3 million on deferred compensation investments and a $0.1 million gain on recovery of auction rate securities that had previously been written off.  Income Taxes  Our income tax expense was $7.0 million, which equates to an effective tax rate of 30.7%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $0.3 million, which equated to an effective tax rate of 1.7%, for the quarter ended October 2, 2015. Our income tax expense was $10.8 million, which equates to an effective tax rate of 27.1%, for the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $16.3 million, which equated to a negative effective tax rate of 53.6%, for the three quarters ended October 2, 2015.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 differs from the 35% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the United States, principally in Malaysia, state income taxes, U.S. research and development tax credits, U.S. domestic production activity and other permanent non-deductible items. Our effective tax rate was negative for the quarter ended October 2, 2015, primarily due to losses in foreign jurisdictions related to the TAOS litigation. The $81.1 million accrual recorded for the TAOS litigation was treated as an unusual and discrete item for the quarter, for which the future tax benefit was $1.2 million, and the loss was allocated primarily to our Malaysian operations. Additionally, the three quarters ended October 2, 2015 included a net tax benefit of $27.7 million related to the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position for which the statutes of limitation in certain jurisdictions expired during the period.  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of September 30, 2016, we had $13.7 million of open purchase orders for inventory from suppliers and $3.1 million of open asset purchase commitments for leasehold improvements and production equipment. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base; the success, timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market; revenue growth or decline; and potential acquisitions. We believe cash flows from operations, together with our cash and investment balances and available credit facility, will provide the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next 12 months for both our domestic and foreign operations. These requirements include our dividend program, the requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity, working capital requirements and potential acquisitions or strategic investments. As of September 30, 2016, our total stockholders' equity was $974.7 million and we had $284 million in cash and cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016, $217.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for federal and state taxation at 37.5% in connection with our Revenue Procedure 99-32 election related to the 2008-2009 IRS examination periods, which allows for the repatriation of $125.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, $70.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries would not be subject to further taxation upon repatriation.  On July 19, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated five-year, $225.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Amended Facility, that matures on July 19, 2021 and is payable in full upon maturity. The Amended Facility replaces our five-year, $325.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Facility, that would have matured on September 1, 2016. Under the Amended Facility, $50.0 million is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit, $30.0 million is available as swing line loans, and $70.0 million is available for multicurrency borrowings. Amounts repaid under the Amended Facility may be re-borrowed. We did not have any outstanding borrowings against the Amended Facility as of September 30, 2016 or against the Facility as of January 1, 2016.  Operating Activities  . . .

Consensus Ratings for Intersil Corp (NASDAQ:ISIL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $20.14 (10.44% downside)

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the related notes. This discussion generally refers to elements within our accompanying consolidated financial statements on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise stated. Except for historical information, the discussions in this section contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  We design and develop innovative power management and precision analog integrated circuits, or ICs. We were formed in August 1999 when we acquired the semiconductor business of Harris Corporation and began operating as Intersil Corporation. That semiconductor business included product portfolios and intellectual property dating back to 1967 when semiconductor companies were just emerging in Silicon Valley. We are now an established supplier of power management and precision analog technology for many of the most rigorous applications in the computing, consumer, and industrial markets. We supply a full range of power IC solutions for battery management, processor power management, and display power management, including power regulators, converters, and controllers as well as fully integrated power modules. We also provide precision analog components such as amplifiers and buffers, proximity and light sensors, data converters, optoelectronics, video decoders, and interface products. As a major supplier of radiation-hardened devices to the military and aerospace industries, our product development methodologies reflect experience designing products to meet the highest standards for reliability and performance in challenging environments.  We utilize a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending on the nearest Friday to December  Pending Merger with Renesas Electronics Corporation  On September 12, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Renesas. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock, other than shares held by stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under Delaware law, and certain shares owned by Intersil, Renesas, and their subsidiaries, will be automatically converted into the right to receive $22.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, plus, if applicable, the amount of any dividend which has a record date prior to the closing date of the Merger and a payment date after the closing date of the Merger.  The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, which we received on December 8, 2016, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Closing of the Merger is expected in the first quarter of 2017.  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and Renesas, including if a governmental body prohibits the Merger or if the Merger is not consummated before July 12, 2017. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we or Renesas will be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $96.5 million.  We recorded transaction-related costs of $7.9 million, principally for outside financial advisory, legal, and related fees and expenses associated with the pending acquisition, in the year ended December 30, 2016. Additional transaction-related costs are expected to be incurred through the closing of the Merger.

Our revenue by end-market was as follows (in thousands and % of revenue):   Year Ended December 30, 2016 January 1, 2016 January 2, 2015 Industrial & infrastructure $ 351,126 64.8 % $ 341,923 65.6 % $ 358,265 63.7 % Computing & consumer 191,013 35.2 179,693 34.4 204,290 36.3 Total $ 542,139 100.0 % $ 521,616 100.0 % $ 562,555 100.0 %  Our revenue for 2016 was $542.1 million, an increase of $20.5 million or 3.9% from 2015. In aggregate, higher overall unit sales in 2016 for the related product mix increased revenue by $23.9 million, which was offset by $3.4 million due to a slight decrease in average selling prices, or ASPs, for the related product mix, as compared to 2015. Revenue from the industrial & infrastructure end-market increased by 2.7% with automotive showing strong growth. Revenue from the computing & consumer end-market increased by 6.3% due to introduction of new products.  Our revenue for 2015 was $521.6 million, a decrease of $40.9 million or 7.3% from 2014. In aggregate, lower overall unit sales in 2015 and a decrease in average selling prices, or ASPs, for the related product mix decreased revenue by $16.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively, as compared to 2014. Revenue during the year was impacted by overall weakness in the demand environment arising from sluggish global economic growth. Industrial & infrastructure revenue decreased by 4.6% due to slower end-market demand. Computing & consumer revenue declined by 12% due to lower sales of certain low-margin consumer products which were deemphasized, lower unit production of personal computers, and delays in new product roll-outs by certain original equipment manufacturers.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Geographical revenue (thousands and % of revenue)   Year Ended December 30, 2016 January 1, 2016 January 2, 2015 Asia $ 391,503 72.2 % $ 374,371 71.8 % $ 411,069 73.1 % North America 96,097 17.7 91,932 17.6 104,306 18.5 Europe and other 54,539 10.1 55,313 10.6 47,180 8.4 Total $ 542,139 100.0 % $ 521,616 100.0 % $ 562,555 100.0 %  Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  Our gross margin increased by 60 basis points in 2016 from 2015. The increase was primarily due to introduction and sale of new products with higher average gross margins. Our gross margin increased by 90 basis points in 2015 from 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher mix of revenue from the industrial & infrastructure end-market.  Generally, our computing & consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial & infrastructure products. We strive to improve gross margins from their present levels by introducing new high-margin products and effecting cost saving opportunities in our manufacturing chain.  Operating Costs and Expenses  Research and Development ("R&D")  Our R&D expenses increased by 3.5% or $4.4 million to $130.8 million in 2016 compared to $126.4 million in 2015 primarily as a result of variable compensation expense of $3.2 million and higher equity-based compensation expense of $2.4 million in 2016 offset by lower payroll and related costs from lower headcount.  Our R&D expenses increased by 0.4% or $0.5 million to $126.4 million in 2015 compared to $125.9 million in 2014 primarily as a result of higher equity-based compensation offset by lower variable compensation expense in 2015.  We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in R&D. As we continue to move to more advanced process technologies, our mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming more complex and expensive, and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total R&D expenses.  Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A")  Our SG&A expenses decreased by 1.1% or $1.1 million to $95.8 million in 2016 compared to $96.9 million in 2015 primarily as a result of lower facilities expense, lower non-recurring severance charges offset by higher variable compensation expense. The facilities expense were lower as we consolidated certain offices.  Our SG&A expenses decreased by 3.0% or $3.0 million to $96.9 million in 2015 compared to $99.9 million in 2014 primarily as a result of lower variable compensation expense and outside legal expenses. During 2014, the outside legal expenses had been higher due to activity related to the TAOS litigation.  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles  Amortization of purchased intangibles was $11.7 million in 2016, $17.6 million in 2015 and $22.2 million in 2014. The decreases in 2016 from 2015 and in 2015 from 2014 were primarily the result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 30, 2016, offset by amortization of intangibles related to the GWS acquisition.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Restructuring and related costs  On June 29, 2016, we began implementation of a plan to decommission our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication line in Palm Bay, Florida, or the 200mm Line. The investment in the 200mm Line was made approximately four years ago to address the need to extend the production life of certain products manufactured at a third party wafer foundry when the supply commitments from the supplier for these products were set to expire at the end of 2014. In July 2015, the supplier was acquired and the acquirer recently decided to continue long-term support for the manufacturing of these products. To avoid the future capital investment anticipated to be required for the 200mm Line, we determined it would be beneficial to our long-term cost structure to source the manufacturing for these products from this supplier and decommission our 200mm Line. Due to this shift in manufacturing to an outside provider, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.9 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016 on these long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line. The impairment charge was calculated as the excess of the assets' carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. We also recorded impairment charges of $1.0 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016 for specific inventory items related to the 200mm Line which had no alternative use. During the quarter ended December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line for $8.5 million and recognized the related gain of $1.1 million as an offset to the restructuring and related costs of $9.9 million recorded during the quarter ended July 1, 2016, resulting in a net restructuring and related costs charge of $8.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2016.  In addition, we recorded $2.5 million of severance and other employee benefit costs related to the decommissioning and other cost reduction actions during 2016. As of December 30, 2016, there was $0.4 million of accrued liabilities related to these actions, which was paid during the first quarter of 2017.  Provision for Export Compliance Settlement  We recorded a provision of $4.0 million in 2014 related to amounts due under the Consent Agreement we entered into with the DTCC to settle claims of alleged violations of ITAR.  Provision for the TAOS litigation  Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions, Inc., or TAOS, named us as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on November 25, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In this action, TAOS alleged four claims consisting of patent infringement, breach of contract, trade secret misappropriation, and tortious interference with a business relationship. On March 6, 2015, the jury found in favor of TAOS on each of the four claims. After certain post-trial motions were heard, the court entered a final judgment on June 9, 2016 against us in the amount of $77.3 million plus court costs and a continuing royalty on certain products found to be infringing TAOS' patent. On June 10, 2016, we filed a notice of appeal; TAOS filed a notice of cross-appeal. Our opening brief was filed in October 2016 and the matter continues to progress.  As a consequence of the jury's verdict, during the quarter ended April 3, 2015, we recorded a provision of $81.1 million related to this matter, including pre-judgment interest and estimated legal costs. As a result of the entry of the June 9, 2016 judgment, we increased our accrual for this matter by $1.3 million in the quarter ended July 1, 2016. Given the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation and because the outcome remains subject to appeal, the ultimate impact of this lawsuit may be materially different from our estimate.  Merger-related expenses  We recorded transaction-related costs of $7.9 million, principally for outside financial advisory, legal, and related fees and expenses associated with the pending acquisition with Renesas, in the year ended December 30, 2016. Additional transaction-related costs are expected to be incurred through the closing of the Merger.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Other Income and Expenses  Interest expense and other  During 2015, upon liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, we wrote off $0.6 million, the amount attributable to that entity that had previously been accumulated as a translation adjustment in Accumulated Comprehensive Income.  Gain on Investments, net  We recognized a gain of $0.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the recovery of previously recognized losses on Auction Rate Securities, or ARS.  Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  Our income tax expense was $14.7 million for 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $22.0 million in 2015. Income tax for 2015, included a $28.0 million benefit relating to release of certain United States federal and state unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, due to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation. The effective tax rate differs from the 35% statutory corporate tax rate primary due to this UTB reserve release and due to losses sustained in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates.  As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate, as well as our actual taxes payable, could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Malaysia where we currently have a tax holiday resulting in a tax rate of 0%. This tax holiday began on July 1, 2009 and terminates on July 1, 2019. In order to retain this holiday in Malaysia, we must meet certain operating conditions, including compliance with warehouse and shipping quotas and specified manufacturing activities in Malaysia. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Malaysia that would otherwise apply to us would be 24%. If we cannot or elect not to comply with these conditions, we could lose the related tax benefits. In such event, we may be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy. Any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangement.  The impact of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the United States federal statutory rate was a benefit of $8.9 million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of 14.3% in 2016, compared to an expense of $15.8 million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of 107% in 2015, and compared to a benefit of $7.9 million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of 10.6% for 2014. In determining net (loss) income, we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we do not believe that the recovery is likely, we establish a valuation allowance. As of December 30, 2016, our net deferred tax amounted to $53.8 million compared to $63.1 million as of January 1, 2016. Applicable guidance requires us to record our tax expense based on various estimates of probabilities of sustaining certain tax positions. As a result of this and other factors, our income tax expense could be volatile, which contributes to volatility in reported financial results. As of December 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016, our gross UTBs related to uncertain tax positions were $9.5 million and $8.7 million, respectively.  As of December 30, 2016, $199.9 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries. Due to an IRS audit for the tax years 2008-2009 and the deemed sale of intangible property to the foreign subsidiaries in 2010, a substantial portion of this cash can be distributed to our U.S. parent without being subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. As of December 30, 2016, a total of $70.5 million can be distributed to our U.S. parent without being subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of December 30, 2016 (in thousands): 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Future minimum lease commitments $ 4,775 $ 4,325 $ 3,216 $ 3,256 $ 3,338 $ 4,217 $ 23,127 Open capital asset purchase commitments 2,683 - - - - - 2,683 Open raw material purchase commitments 19,333 - - - - - 19,333 Other purchase commitments 4,598 4,445 3,201 98 - - 12,342 Total $ 31,389 $ 8,770 $ 6,417 $ 3,354 $ 3,338 $ 4,217 $ 57,485  Our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property.  As of December 30, 2016, our net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were $9.5 million, of which $2.1 million are classified as long-term liabilities and $7.4 million are netted against deferred tax assets. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the payments, if any, in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits. As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base; the success, timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market; revenue growth or decline; our level of expenses and net income; and potential acquisitions. We believe cash flows from operations together with our cash and investment balances and available credit facility will provide the financial resources necessary to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months for both our domestic and foreign operations. These requirements include our dividend program, the requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity, working capital requirements and potential acquisitions or strategic investments.  As of December 30, 2016, $199.9 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for federal and state taxation at a cumulative rate of 37.5% in connection with the Revenue Procedure 99-32 election related to the 2008-2009 IRS examination periods that allows for the repatriation of $125.0 million, $70.5 million of which remains available to repatriate as of December 30, 2016.  On July 19, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated five-year, $225.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Amended Facility, that matures on July 19, 2021 and is payable in full upon maturity. The Amended Facility replaced our five-year, $325.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Facility, that would have matured on September 1, 2016. Under the Amended Facility, $50.0 million is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit, $30.0 million is available as swing line loans, and $70.0 million is available for multicurrency borrowings. Amounts repaid under the Amended Facility may be re-borrowed. The Amended Facility bears interest rate for all revolving loans on a pricing grid ranging from 0.5% to 1.25% per annum for base rate loans and 1.5% to 2.25% for Eurocurrency rate loans based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit facility agreement). We did not have any outstanding borrowings against the Amended Facility as of December 30, 2016 or against the Facility as of January 1, 2016 and were in compliance with all applicable covenants.  Operating Activities  Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 were $104.7 million, compared to $117.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $12.3 million. The cash flow from operations decreased primarily due to the following:  - Trade receivables increased by $11.6 million due to higher revenue in the quarter ended December 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended January 1, 2016.  - Income taxes receivable decreased by $8.1 million. Please see Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.  Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 were $117.0 million, compared to $73.4 million in 2014, an increase of $43.6 million. The cash flow from operations increased primarily due to the following:  - A provision for the TAOS litigation of $81.1 million was recorded during 2015. During 2015, we paid $3.1 million in legal fees related to the TAOS litigation. Please see Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.  - Accounts receivables decreased by $13.2 million during 2015 mainly due to improved linearity of shipments during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.  - Inventories decreased by $8.4 million in 2015 consequent to our initiatives during the year to manage inventory levels.  - Income taxes payable decreased by $64.1 million. Other long-term assets / liabilities, net decreased by $35.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in deferred taxes. The decreases in income taxes payable and deferred taxes were due to settlement of uncertain tax positions.  Investing activities  Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases and maturities.  Net cash used in investing activities was $83.2 million in 2016, compared to $27.7 million used in 2015 and $ 8.8 million in 2014. We purchased $82.7 million of short-term investments in 2016. Capital expenditures were $9.5 million in 2016 compared to $13.0 million in 2015. We also received a total of $7.7 million from the sale of the long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line.  During 2015 we paid cash of $15.9 million for the acquisition of Great Wall Semiconductor. Capital expenditures were $13.0 million in 2015 compared to $9.9 million in 2014.  Financing activities  Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, proceeds from issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan, and issuance and repayment of long-term debt.  Net cash used in financing activities was $43.2 million in 2016, compared to $51.5 million in 2015 and $46.0 million in 2014. We paid dividends of $68.4 million, $64.9 million and $62.9 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014 . . .  Feb 17, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
