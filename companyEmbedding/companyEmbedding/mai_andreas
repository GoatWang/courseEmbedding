Top critical reviewSee all 2 critical reviews› 1.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Handel DiscByRedgeoffon 27 February 2013I hope I have given this a five star rating, because it deserves it. The selection of Handel music is qwell balanced and Andreas Scholl proves that he can interpret Handel with the best. Clear enunciation, superb rhythm and that heavenly voice combine to transport you to  an era when the hjighest male voice was highly valued if a littkle different to a modern male alto. I reccomend this for lovers of Handel and Scholl!

There was a problem loading the comments at the moment. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsStunning compilationByT. Masonon 29 August 2010Format: Audio CDDespite his numerous recordings, there are still some real gems here which don't feature in his other compilation works.  The CD is worth it for "Verdi Prati" alone, though I try not to listen to it too often as I can't concentrate for hours afterwards. Yes, it's well known and has been sung and recorded by scores of other singers, in a variety of voices, but absolutely no-one (not even the magnificent Sarah Connolly) can come close to Andreas Scholl's version, which simply penetrates your mind, body and soul.Oh, and there's some pretty decent other arias too!  "Se in fiorito" is very sprightly, but it's worth getting hold of the DVD of the 2005 Copenhagen opera production to see it performed with the stunning Finnish violinist of Concerto Copenhagen .... it is 8 minutes of sheer magic (actually, the entire DVD of that production is just outstanding, including the other aria on this CD).I'm forced to agree with the earlier reviewer that there is rather more orchestral music than might have been anticipated, but the Akademie are always worth hearing and there are a few surprises which would have passed me by otherwise.  Besides, it really doesn't matter... when you listen to the arias nothing else much matters.0Comment|
