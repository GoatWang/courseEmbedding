OUR JOURNEY
We’ve been transforming the communications landscape for decades. Some of our roots began in the late 1980’s with a local Minnesota telco consortium which eventually became Onvoy in 1997. In 2003, as Neutral Tandem, we created an independent tandem backbone network — the first of its kind — that streamlined call routing across wireless, cable and broadband networks. and we quickly grew to be the largest provider of tandem network services in the United States. In 2007, Onvoy was acquired by Zayo Group and then spun out of Zayo in 2014 after acquiring Vitelity, LLC. Onvoy, LLC continued major growth acquiring Broadvox and Layered Communications in 2015, followed by ANPI in 2016. GTCR, the PE firm which owns Onvoy, LLC, acquired Inteliquent in early 2017 and merged the two companies under the Inteliquent brand. Today, Inteliquent forges ahead leading communications enablement for today’s service providers.

History[edit]
In 2003, Inteliquent created the first independent tandem network - a "network of networks" uniquely interconnecting disparate carrier networks to facilitate the exchange of traffic.

2001 - Neutral Tandem was incorporated.
2003 - Neutral Tandem's first location opened at 2 North LaSalle Street in Chicago.
2004 - Neutral Tandem acquired Origin Communications.
2006 - Completed the installation of a national IP backbone and extended its reach by interconnecting 179 markets.
2007 - Neutral Tandem's first public offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol IQNT and Zayo acquired Onvoy, Inc.
2008 - Neutral Tandem fully transitioned to an all-IP core network. Added terminating and originating switched access services, which are provided in connection with long distance calls.
2010 - Named no. 2 on Crain’s Fast 50 (fastest-growing companies by five-year revenue growth).[1] - Completed acquisition of Tinet SpA, an Italian-based global carrier in the IP Transit and Ethernet wholesale market.[2] - Reached 108.5 billion network billed minutes, an increase of 23.5% over 2009; and revenue of $199.8 million, an increase of 18.3% compared to $168.9 million in 2009.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
