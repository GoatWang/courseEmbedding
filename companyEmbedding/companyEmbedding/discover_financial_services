History[edit]
The Discover Card was originally introduced by Sears in 1985, and was a unit of Dean Witter, which merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997. In 2007, the unit was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company. Today, Discover is headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Riverwoods, Illinois.
On December 21, 2001, Fourth quarter income at Discover card issuer Discover Financial Services Inc. grew 31% to $193 million, compared with $147 million the year before.[4]
On March 5, 2002, the company announced that the Account Center at Discovercard.com had registered over eight million card members, an increase of 61 percent since January 2001.[5] That September, they announced that, as of September 1, Citibank would accept the Discover(R) Card for cash advances at its approximately 450 Financial Centers and more than 2,000 ATM locations nationwide.[6]
Discover acquires Diners Club[edit]
In April 2008, Discover Financial and Citigroup announced that Discover was purchasing the Diners Club network from Citigroup for $165 million. In May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction. The deal was completed on July 1, 2008.[7] Discover stated that the Diners Club network, which is a major network outside North America, will be merged with the Discover Network, a major network in North America, creating an international network for Discover Network cards and Diners Club cards. Diners Club cards will continue to be issued by Diners Club International licensees. Discover Bank has no plans on issuing Diners Club branded cards itself.
On September 17, 2010, it was announced that Discover Financial would acquire Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation for $30/share.[8] The deal was finalized on December 31.[9]
Discover acquires Home Loan Center[edit]
On June 6, 2012, Tree.com, Inc. completed the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of its Home Loan Center, Inc. business to a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial. In exchange for the assets sold, Discover paid an aggregate of $45.9 million including payments made prior to the closing which were applied to the closing price.[10] On June 12, 2012, Discover began originating mortgages with its launch of Discover Home Loans, offering prime variable- and fixed-rate conventional and FHA home mortgage loans.
Discover and TARP[edit]
Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Discover received about $1.2 billion in bailout funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP. The company announced in 2010 that it had received approval to pay back the funds.[11]
Competitors[edit]
In the United States, Discover, as a card brand, competes primarily with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.[12] Unlike Visa and MasterCard, Discover directly issues its cards, through its Discover Bank unit.[13] Discover is the sixth largest credit card issuer in the U.S., when measured by card balances, behind JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Capital One and American Express, and ahead of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.[14]
Business[edit]
In addition to its card products, Discover also markets savings products, checking accounts, personal loans, student loans, and home equity loans. The company also began offering a Discover Debit card product directly to banks in 2006, through its Pulse interbank network, which Discover acquired in 2004.

The Discover Card was originally introduced by Sears in 1985, and was a unit of Dean Witter, which merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997. In 2007, the unit was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company. Today, Discover is headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Riverwoods, Illinois.
On December 21, 2001, Fourth quarter income at Discover card issuer Discover Financial Services Inc. grew 31% to $193 million, compared with $147 million the year before.[4]
On March 5, 2002, the company announced that the Account Center at Discovercard.com had registered over eight million card members, an increase of 61 percent since January 2001.[5] That September, they announced that, as of September 1, Citibank would accept the Discover(R) Card for cash advances at its approximately 450 Financial Centers and more than 2,000 ATM locations nationwide.[6]
Discover acquires Diners Club[edit]
In April 2008, Discover Financial and Citigroup announced that Discover was purchasing the Diners Club network from Citigroup for $165 million. In May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction. The deal was completed on July 1, 2008.[7] Discover stated that the Diners Club network, which is a major network outside North America, will be merged with the Discover Network, a major network in North America, creating an international network for Discover Network cards and Diners Club cards. Diners Club cards will continue to be issued by Diners Club International licensees. Discover Bank has no plans on issuing Diners Club branded cards itself.
On September 17, 2010, it was announced that Discover Financial would acquire Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation for $30/share.[8] The deal was finalized on December 31.[9]
Discover acquires Home Loan Center[edit]
On June 6, 2012, Tree.com, Inc. completed the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of its Home Loan Center, Inc. business to a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial. In exchange for the assets sold, Discover paid an aggregate of $45.9 million including payments made prior to the closing which were applied to the closing price.[10] On June 12, 2012, Discover began originating mortgages with its launch of Discover Home Loans, offering prime variable- and fixed-rate conventional and FHA home mortgage loans.
Discover and TARP[edit]
Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Discover received about $1.2 billion in bailout funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP. The company announced in 2010 that it had received approval to pay back the funds.[11]
Competitors[edit]
In the United States, Discover, as a card brand, competes primarily with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.[12] Unlike Visa and MasterCard, Discover directly issues its cards, through its Discover Bank unit.[13] Discover is the sixth largest credit card issuer in the U.S., when measured by card balances, behind JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Capital One and American Express, and ahead of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.[14]
Business[edit]
In addition to its card products, Discover also markets savings products, checking accounts, personal loans, student loans, and home equity loans. The company also began offering a Discover Debit card product directly to banks in 2006, through its Pulse interbank network, which Discover acquired in 2004.

Discover Financial Services, Inc. is an American financial services company, which issues the Discover Card and operates the Discover and Pulse networks, and owns Diners Club International.

History[edit]
The Discover Card was originally introduced by Sears in 1985, and was a unit of Dean Witter, which merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997. In 2007, the unit was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company. Today, Discover is headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Riverwoods, Illinois.
On December 21, 2001, Fourth quarter income at Discover card issuer Discover Financial Services Inc. grew 31% to $193 million, compared with $147 million the year before.[4]
On March 5, 2002, the company announced that the Account Center at Discovercard.com had registered over eight million card members, an increase of 61 percent since January 2001.[5] That September, they announced that, as of September 1, Citibank would accept the Discover(R) Card for cash advances at its approximately 450 Financial Centers and more than 2,000 ATM locations nationwide.[6]
Discover acquires Diners Club[edit]
In April 2008, Discover Financial and Citigroup announced that Discover was purchasing the Diners Club network from Citigroup for $165 million. In May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction. The deal was completed on July 1, 2008.[7] Discover stated that the Diners Club network, which is a major network outside North America, will be merged with the Discover Network, a major network in North America, creating an international network for Discover Network cards and Diners Club cards. Diners Club cards will continue to be issued by Diners Club International licensees. Discover Bank has no plans on issuing Diners Club branded cards itself.
On September 17, 2010, it was announced that Discover Financial would acquire Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation for $30/share.[8] The deal was finalized on December 31.[9]
Discover acquires Home Loan Center[edit]
On June 6, 2012, Tree.com, Inc. completed the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of its Home Loan Center, Inc. business to a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial. In exchange for the assets sold, Discover paid an aggregate of $45.9 million including payments made prior to the closing which were applied to the closing price.[10] On June 12, 2012, Discover began originating mortgages with its launch of Discover Home Loans, offering prime variable- and fixed-rate conventional and FHA home mortgage loans.
Discover and TARP[edit]
Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Discover received about $1.2 billion in bailout funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP. The company announced in 2010 that it had received approval to pay back the funds.[11]
Competitors[edit]
In the United States, Discover, as a card brand, competes primarily with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.[12] Unlike Visa and MasterCard, Discover directly issues its cards, through its Discover Bank unit.[13] Discover is the sixth largest credit card issuer in the U.S., when measured by card balances, behind JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Capital One and American Express, and ahead of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.[14]
Business[edit]
In addition to its card products, Discover also markets savings products, checking accounts, personal loans, student loans, and home equity loans. The company also began offering a Discover Debit card product directly to banks in 2006, through its Pulse interbank network, which Discover acquired in 2004.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Our History
From a credit card pioneer to a leading direct bank.
The success behind what makes us one of the nation's leading direct banks today is the same as what made us a pioneer in 1986 when we launched the Discover card: a focus on the customer and a commitment to be different, to be better and to offer the best service in the business.
Putting customers first is in our DNA.
Discover brought innovation and change to the credit card industry - change that focused on features and services that consumers wanted, but couldn't find in other credit cards. Discover changed that by pioneering cash rewards and offering a card with no annual fee. We've never lost sight of our heritage and remain focused on the customer today.
We have one of the most recognized brands in U.S. financial services.
Today, Discover is a leading direct bank and electronic payment services company. Our direct bank issues the company's flagship credit card business and offers an array of banking products, such as private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans, checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Discover operates PULSE, one of the nation's leading ATM/debit networks; Discover Network, with millions of merchant and cash access locations; and Diners Club International, a global payments network with acceptance in more than 185 countries and territories.

Our Company


We've always believed in giving our customers the best service.
When we introduced the first cash rewards credit card in 1986, we committed ourselves to meeting the needs of our cardmembers with the best possible customer service - and we still stand by that commitment today. We're building our company by listening to consumers and developing products and programs that help them get the most for their money. Beyond credit cards, our banking and payments businesses offer rewarding products backed by that same commitment to high-quality service that we have had from the start.

Banking
Our banking business includes Discover-card branded credit cards, private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans, checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts.

Payments

It's very satisfying when a cardmember has that light-bulb moment gaining a better understanding of their account because of something I've explained. After we finish the call I like to think they say to themselves, "That's why I use Discover!"

Discover is an online banking leader with products and services that extend beyond credit cards into other loans and savings products, all of which offer our customers great rates and superior customer service. 

Discover Card
The Discover card was launched with a simple objective: to reward customer loyalty in a more meaningful way, while also providing more choice and control over credit. We were the first to introduce a cash rewards card and also offered no annual fee and 24/7 customer service, which was almost unheard of back in 1986. We're now one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States and offer a comprehensive line of cash, travel and gift cards to both consumers and small businesses alike.

Discover Financial Services Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $546 Million or $1.40 Per Diluted Share


July 26, 2017

Download this Press Release ()


 RIVERWOODS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) today reported net income of
      $546 million or $1.40 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017,
      as compared to $616 million or $1.47 per diluted share for the second
      quarter of 2016. The company’s return on equity for the second quarter
      of 2017 was 19%.
    

Second Quarter Highlights



        Total loans grew $6.1 billion (8%) from the prior year to $78.0
        billion.
      

        Credit card loans grew $4.6 billion (8%) to $61.8 billion and Discover
        card sales volume increased 5% from the prior year.
      

        Total net charge-off rate excluding PCI loans increased 52 basis
        points from the prior year to 2.79% and the total delinquency rate
        over 30 days past due excluding PCI loans increased 33 basis points
        from the prior year to 1.93%.
      

        Consumer deposits grew $3.6 billion (11%) from the prior year to $37.7
        billion.
      

        Payment Services transaction dollar volume was $50.1 billion, up 12%
        from the prior year.
      


      “We delivered profitable loan growth, strong revenue growth and positive
      operating leverage, which helped to offset normalizing credit costs,”
      said David Nelms, chairman and CEO of Discover. “Our new capital plan
      includes higher dividends and planned share repurchases, and we expect
      to continue to deliver a leading yield to our shareholders."
    

Segment Results:


Direct Banking


      Direct Banking pretax income of $831 million in the quarter declined $37
      million (4%) from the prior year as higher provision for loan losses
      more than offset higher net interest income.
    

      Total loans ended the quarter at $78.0 billion, up 8% compared to the
      prior year. Credit card loans ended the quarter at $61.8 billion, up 8%
      from the prior year. Personal loans increased $1.2 billion (22%) from
      the prior year. Private student loans increased $191 million (2%)
      year-over-year, and grew $703 million (12%) excluding purchased student
      loans.
    

      Net interest income increased $187 million (11%) from the prior year,
      driven by loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Net interest
      margin was 10.11%, up 16 basis points from the prior year. Card yield
      was 12.66%, an increase of 24 basis points from the prior year because
      of increases in the prime rate, partially offset by higher interest
      charge-offs. Interest expense as a percent of total loans increased 16
      basis points from the prior year, primarily because of higher market
      rates and a change in funding mix.
    

      Other income increased $12 million (3%) from the prior year, driven by
      higher discount and interchange revenue.
    

      The delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due was
      2.00%, up 37 basis points from the prior year and down 6 basis points
      from the prior quarter. The credit card net charge-off rate for the
      second quarter was 2.94%, up 55 basis points from the prior year and 10
      basis points from the prior quarter. The student loan net charge-off
      rate excluding purchased credit-impaired ("PCI") loans was 1.15%, up 5
      basis points from the prior year. The personal loans net charge-off rate
      of 3.18% increased by 80 basis points from the prior year. Net
      charge-off rates were generally higher because of supply-driven credit
      normalization and the seasoning of loan growth from the last few years.
    

      Provision for loan losses of $639 million increased $228 million from
      the prior year primarily because of higher net charge-offs. The reserve
      build for the second quarter of 2017 was $119 million, compared to a
      reserve build of $27 million in the second quarter of 2016.
    

      Expenses increased $8 million from the prior year as higher employee
      compensation was partially offset by a decline in information
      processing, mainly due to infrastructure efficiencies. Employee
      compensation increased mostly because of higher staffing levels, as well
      as higher average salaries.
    

Payment Services


      Payment Services pretax income was $36 million in the quarter, up $6
      million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher transaction
      processing revenue and lower operating expense.
    

      Payment Services transaction dollar volume was $50.1 billion, up 12%
      versus the prior year. PULSE transaction dollar volume was up 15%
      year-over-year. Diners Club International volume increased 8% from the
      prior year, driven by growth across all regions.
    

Share Repurchases


      During the second quarter of 2017, the company repurchased approximately
      7.2 million shares of common stock for $450 million. Shares of common
      stock outstanding declined by 1.9% from the prior quarter.
    

Conference Call and Webcast Information


      The company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter
      results on Wednesday, July 26, 2017, at 4:00 p.m. Central time.
      Interested parties can listen to the conference call via a live audio
      webcast at https://investorrelations.discover.com.

2 Purchased Credit Impaired ("PCI") loans are loans that
          were acquired in which a deterioration in credit quality occurred
          between the origination date and the acquisition date. These loans
          were initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income
          over the estimated lives of the loans as long as cash flows are
          reasonably estimable, even if the loans are contractually past due.
          PCI loans are private student loans and are included in total loan
          receivables.
        



           
        



3 Excludes PCI loans (described above) which are
          accounted for on a pooled basis. Since a pool is accounted for as a
          single asset with a single composite interest rate and aggregate
          expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of a pool, or that of
          the individual loans within a pool, is not meaningful. Because the
          Company is recognizing interest income on a pool of loans, it is all
          considered to be performing.
