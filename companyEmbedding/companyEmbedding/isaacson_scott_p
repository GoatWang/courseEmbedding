			Mr. Isaacson became a director of our Company in November 2011. He is experienced in advising and representing companies regarding a variety of corporate, business transactions, contracts and compliance matters, particularly in managing programs related to environmental and regulatory risk issues. From 1999 to February 2016, he held various positions with CalPortland Company including Senior Vice President-General Counsel where he managed corporate legal matters, business relations, litigation, intellectual property, acquisitions and mergers, and compliance programs for this construction materials manufacturing company with operations located in the Western United States. He also has served as a director of numerous subsidiaries of that company for several years. Mr. Isaacson is an experienced legal expert with a broad knowledge of corporate legal issues, especially in regard to environmental compliance requirements mandated by major federal environmental laws and programs as well as related state programs. He has been the principal advising attorney on environmental issues for complex, multi-program projects to include industrial air emissions, development projects, and, more recently, federal and state actions to regulate greenhouse gases. In his prior position as a partner with the Seattle law firm of Bogle and Gates, he advised business clients on federal, state and local environmental issues regarding compliance, land use, government contractor liability and exposure to toxic or hazardous materials as well as issues related to individual and corporate civil and criminal liability. Clients included local governments and a number of large and mid-size businesses and companies involved in manufacturing, production, and service. Previous to that, he was the Chief of the Environmental Law Division at the Department of the Army and the senior attorney responsible for advising commands throughout the United States on environmental policy and compliance issues arising from Army activities, and handled or supervised complex and significant environmental actions that were under the scrutiny of federal, state, and local regulators as well as interested private environmental organizations. Mr. Isaacson holds a BSc. from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Juris Doctor from the University of Washington. He is a member of the bar for United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. Mr. Isaacson's business experience and legal expertise, particularly in the field of environmental compliance, led us to conclude that he should serve as a director.
