Senior Living Fund, LLC: Deadline Approaches To Receive Highest Return Units



Share Article


















This February, investment firm Senior Living Fund, LLC is announcing that it has nearly exhausted the units in its popular new senior housing fund.








We believe the strength of the operator is the number one indicator of the viability of a senior housing project.


Lenexa, KS (PRWEB)
February 19, 2016
 Senior Living Fund, LLC recently announced it has nearly exhausted the units with the highest targeted return in its popular new senior housing fund, Senior Living Fund I.
Senior Living Fund, LLC provides a number of investment opportunities within the senior housing industry, but its latest offering, Senior Living Fund I, is the first fund that is diversified across several new senior housing development projects across the USA. Now, Senior Living Fund Principal Dan Brewer says the firm projects that it will exhaust the investment units that offer the highest rate of return sometime between the end of February through early March. He strongly encourages interested investors to contact the company by the end of February to reserve these units.
As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the number of Americans ages 65 and older is estimated to increase by about 31 million to reach a total population of 79.2 million. Currently, approximately 22,000 new senior housing units are added annually; to keep up with this explosive growth in seniors, the country will require up to 60,000 new units per year, an increase of 173% over current development levels.
For this reason, Brewer says investing in senior housing is a prudent, long-term investment strategy.
"We focus exclusively on housing operators with a strong history and track record of success. We believe the strength of the operator is the number one indicator of the viability of a senior housing project. Not only have we developed relationships with many senior housing operators, but with other key resources within the senior housing industry as well," says Brewer.
Senior Living Fund I offers four classes of investment tiers. Class B and D pay the highest preferred rates of return, and Brewer says they are by far the most popular choice among early investors. Interested parties need to contact the firm during February, and the company will work with investors to complete their investment.
Senior Living Fund I is only available to accredited investors; approximately one-third of investors use an IRA.

		3 Senior Housing REITs to Fund Your Retirement	
These senior REITs throw off big dividend yields

Sep 19, 2014, 9:11 am EDT  |  By Charles Sizemore, Principal of Sizemore Capital



 
  View All  

The Baby Boomers are going to need a new place to crash.
The largest generation in U.S. history is retiring en masse, and as things stand now, America lacks the senior housing inventory to accommodate them. A staggering 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day, and over the next 15 years, the number of Americans over the age of 50 will swell to 132 million. This means unprecedented demand for everything from active retirement communities with golf and tennis lessons to assisted living with full-time nurses.
This is fantastic news if you happen to be a senior housing landlord — and with the plethora of publicly traded senior-themed REITs, you can, indeed, be a landlord. Today, we’re going to look at the senior housing REITs best positioned to profit from the graying of America.
I should be clear on one point: Investing based on demographic trends is a long-term strategy. But your patience is likely to be rewarded. In their groundbreaking 2005 paper on demographics and industry returns, professors Stefano DellaVigna and Joshua Pollet found that, over time horizons of five to ten years, each additional point of annual demand growth due to demographic factors led to a 5%-10% jump in annual abnormal industry stock returns. But over periods of five years or less, demographics had little impact on stock returns. So just remember that patience is key with demographic trends.

Senior Housing Investments Funding Senior Communities Investing in Longevity | Senior Living Investment Made Easy











































 


































 




You are Invited To Join the Senior Living Fund In a Remarkable Off Market Passive Income Investment Opportunity  


Your browser does not support this contact form. The contact form cannot be displayed. Please Email us at team@seniorlivingfund.com




 







The profound growth dynamics of the U.S. senior population and the success of the U.S. seniors housing industry create a powerful investment environment and position the Senior Living Investment Fund  for consistent profits in structured development opportunities. Demand for Senior Housing Continues to Exceed Supply. As an investor you can participate in early stage Senior Living Facility Developments







 
 
 


 
Why Senior Housing is Real Estate’s Most Recession Proof Asset Class ?
 
 




HIGH DEMAND  
The rate at which American Seniors are retiring is truly staggering. The number of Americans 65 and older will increase from 47.8 million in 2015 to 79.2 million by 2035, due to the emergence of Baby Boomers into the age of retirement. Such a vast increase only creates a greater demand for Senior Living Facilities.





LOW SUPPLY 
As the elderly population grows, the rate of senior housing new construction is not keeping pace. Units under construction began a significant decline in 2008 and continued to fall through 2011 with only modest growth through 2014. When these two dynamics are married, the need that is left unaddressed is the growing market for newer and better facilities/communities tailored to emerging retirees.




 




10000 Baby BoomersBaby Boomers Turn 65 Each Day






60000New Senior Housing Units Required Per Year  




 
 173Percent Increase Per Year In  Senior Housing Units is Necessary To Meet The Projected Demand

You Can Earn
 13%-21% Annualized Projected Rates of Return
By Participating with Senior Living Fund in the Funding & Development of New Senior Housing Communities!






–
–
Senior Living Facilities are well positioned for success in all phases of the real estate cycle
 
Each Senior Living Development is Carefully Evaluated & Vetted

 

A detailed examination of all the risk elements are evaluated, managed and mitigated.
 



			–
		



 
Market demand, facility design & construction, location intelligence, operations management,  financial reserves, sound economics/business model and an executable exit strategy all must be present before any senior living development project is considered. Senior Living Fund gives investors insider access to these pre-vetted developments.
 
Senior Living as an asset class has been historically difficult for average investors to access until now. Institutional investors and specialized operators have been the primary beneficiaries concentrating on an asset class whose demand has been driven by major demographic trends.  Now astute individual investors can also capitalize on these trends and earn strong yields in a proven niche.
 
On a national macro level the demographic trends are clear. The rapidly aging population is fueling demand for senior living facilities that are in short supply. This is the main driver for growth and why senior living has continuously proven to be a strong asset class regardless of the condition of the overall economy.
 
On a micro level a much more detailed Due Diligence process takes place on each and every project to ensure every new senior living development is a success for investors and residents alike.  The projected returns of 13% – 21% are exceptional given the relative low risk of the investment.
 








 
LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR DETAILED DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS 











Location Selection: On every project sponsored by Senior Living Fund an independent 3rd party consultant is brought in to look at the local supply and demand and conduct absorption studies to insure facilities only get built in the highest demand micro markets.
Facility Design: Facilities are designed to highest standards for residence and for each project we bring in consultants on facility design that are known throughout the industry. Our facility designs are state of the art properties that are held in high regard by leading health care REITs which assist in executing exit strategy. More importantly our facility designs meet the demands on senior Baby Boomers, creating communities with multiple social destinations, restaurant style dining, spacious private rooms and baths, as well as therapy & wellness. The bottom line is Senior Living Fund encourages designs that afford the quality lifestyle that aging Americans deserve.
Developers: A detailed inquiry into each development team looks at the experience and track record of the developer. Our typical developer always has a seasoned team often with decades of experience in construction, development and management experience in the assisted living field.
Long Term Operators: *** This is where Senior Living projects differ from other real estate classes like multifamily, office or retail. The management of the facilities are highly specialized to the care of seniors. Having the right long term operator is possibly the most critical factor in a project’s success. Senior living Fund only works with long term operators with a track record of successful operation of senior living facilities in multiple states and multiple markets. Having high quality well respected Long Term Operators is one of the most essential elements in any senior living development.
Pre-Market Activities: Our operators start marketing occupancy during the development cycle. These Pre-market activities help minimize the time needed for stabilization and gets our properties to full occupancy and operational stabilization in short order.
Investor Exit Strategy: Senior Living Fund conducts the utmost due diligence on our Developers, Long Term Operators, Location Intelligence & Facility Design. Our facilities are operational and stabilized in the shortest amount of time possible. Facilities are built on demand to be acquired by a REIT or refinanced via HUD long term permanent financing typically in 48 months. A definitive timeline and exit strategy help mitigate and insure successful outcomes for all partners and investors.








 
 
How Does Senior Housing Perform Against Other Real Estate Sectors?
–







–
Senior Housing Is A Recession Resilient Asset Class
 







A major benefit for investors in the Senior Housing space is the resiliency of this particular sector of the commercial market. A key component of the Senior Housing market’s success is its lack of reliance on a particular economic or real estate environment. Senior Housing has been the number one performing commercial real estate sector for the last ten years. This includes the period encompassing the 2007 capital market collapse, in-which returns among other commercial sectors fell as much as 20%.








 

 
 



 
 
 
Senior Housing Has Been the Best Performing
Commercial Real Estate Sector For the Past 10 Years.
