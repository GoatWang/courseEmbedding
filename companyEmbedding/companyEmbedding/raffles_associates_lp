Is it necessary to have a home alarm system professionally installed?No, it is possible to install a home alarm system yourself. Some systems are specifically designed to be installed by homeowners. These systems are often cheaper and more customizable. However some systems require the expertise of a professional and installation should be left up to them to avoid making any errors. Review the specifications of the system and/or contact the manufacturer if you are unsure about its installation requirements.What are the advantages of a wireless security system?
Easy and inexpensive to install and does not require any drilling or modification of the home.
Does not require a landline.
Can be taken from one home to another during change of residence.
Can be combined with a hardwired system.
What are the advantages of a hardwired security system?
No need to change any batteries, as with wireless systems
No interference from other signals
All hardwired systems run on essentially the same technology so products and services from different companies will be compatible with each other.
If moving to a home with a hardwired system already installed, you can save money by bypassing installation costs.
New security equipment for these systems is less expensive than for wireless systems.
Can be combined with a wireless system
What are the different types of home security alarms?
Hardwired: A system that uses cables to connect all sensors to a central control panel within your home. The cables are usually installed within the walls or floorboards of your home. The control panel then uses your home’s landline connection to call for assistance (police, fire, medic).
Wireless: A system which uses wireless technology (wi-fi) to connect all sensors to your home’s central control panel. The panel uses the established network to communicate with the outside for assistance.
A combination of hardwired and wireless: Custom systems can be configured to have a home totally hardwired and equipped with wireless outside communication (no landline), or have a totally wireless home and hardwired outside communication.
Will a home alarm system continue working in the event of a power outage?The majority of modern alarms (both hardwired and wireless) have control panels with a rechargeable back-up battery that powers the alarm system in the event of a power outage. But the batteries will eventually die if the power outage is several hours long.How much does a home alarm system cost?There are many costs associated with getting an alarm system:

System Type: Hardwired or wireless
Number of Components: How many door sensors, window sensors, and cameras. are implemented
Installation: DIY installation or professionally installed
Monitoring Costs: If a system is linked to a monitoring service that will alert response personnel in the event of an emergency

Alarm systems themselves can cost $100- $1,200. Having a monitoring service requires paying monthly fees, usually of $25-$45 or more depending on the company.Does having (or not having) an alarm system impact the cost of home insurance?Yes, many home insurers will reduce rates for homeowners that purchase security systems. Some security system companies also have deals with insurers and can offer discounted prices on products and installation. Check with your home insurance company to find out what options are available to you.Is a monitoring service required with all security systems?No, there are many security systems available that do not require the implementation of a monitoring system.Can the capabilities of a home security system be expanded over time?Yes, but to avoid compatibility issues, it is best to use the same company that installed the original system to make any new modifications or enhancements. However, there are companies that make converters which integrate products or systems from two different security companies.See more Tips & AdviceADT - Official Sales CenterFind a Location(800) 539-9858Call to Get ADT With a 6 Month Guarantee!WebsiteMore InfoKnight Security NY(1)250 W 26th St Rm 3115, New York, NY 10001(646) 854-2410Security.

In this case a badge. When I asked what they were here for they told me it was none of my business yet they were parked in front of my building all weekend. The first in ght they left the yellow security lights on the top of the car run all night even though they where parked at the curb.  Tonight we had 2 cars with the lights running. It turns out they were working for Con Ed. Are tax dollars at work.Century Security Solutions Inc  |  ADT Authorized DealerOvi R. ratedSuperb and affordable security products. Excellent and very professional customer services. I would recommend this product to all the home owners and business owners out there. Very pleased doing business with them. Made me feel part of their family, with personal contacts given. Took less than 2 days for the system to be up and running. I am not too tech savvy with this security system. They took their time on explaining each little details and was very patient with my silly questions. Once again, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL!!!!Queens Spy ShopQueens S. ratedThe best place for spy cameras, surveillance equipment, detox drinks and hidden camera gadgets. Police mini family badges, pepper spray, steel batons, metal detectors, cctv equipment, wireless security cameras, digital video recorders, listening devices and cheating spouse products. Top seller in New York for Gps tracking! Retired undercover personnel with over 20 years of experience. Best customer service in this industry. Great showroom and plenty of products. Items arent cheap but the experience is worth it.Lifeshield Home Security Systtimnyc ratedAs a renter, this system is gr...As a renter, this system is great because I don't have to worry about buying a new system and re installing it if I move.  The ability to control it from my phone has been extremely useful as well, since I don't have to plan out every time I've been in and out.  It's been straightforward enough that I haven't had to contact customer service, but they have been nice and responsive based on other reviews.Queens Spy ShopJohn moore H. ratedIf you are ever in need of hidden cameras to catch a cheating spouse or theft in the workplace, this place has it all. They have hi tech, James Bond products that will knock your socks off. They sell hidden cameras which you can view live video directly on your cell phone. They have this awesome license plate flipper which comes in handy for red light and speed cameras. This place is everything!Lifeshield Home Security Systleonard_hand ratedWith the chaos surrounding Hur...With the chaos surrounding Hurricane Sandy, I've become #1 advocate for Lifeshield Security. During the prolonged power outage, my wireless home system did not fail.  Being able to rely on fire monitoring AND knowing that my home would be defended from looting allowed me to sleep through the night, which was tremendous help.
