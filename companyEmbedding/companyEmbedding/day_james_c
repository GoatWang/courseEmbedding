Hadar F. 
Experienced Nanny And Tutor Looking For Occasional Babysitting Jobs — Mountain View, CA 
 I worked as an Au pair for a year and a half with a family with 3 kids ages 3, 5 and 8. The job included everything from preparing meals, baths, bed time, carpools, day time activities, etc. I have also worked as a counselor at a summer camp for two summers with kids ages 6 - 18. I babysat a baby aged 6 months. I have been tutoring in English, Math, Hebrew, help with homework and more for kids up to 12 years old. Plus I have had more babysitting and nanny jobs over the past 10 years. Most importantly I genuinely love and enjoy kids, I have fun with them and they have fun with me. I can go on and on about how great I am and how I would be the best nanny but I think the best way for you to know is by meeting me.

Meghan G. 
 
 Hi, my name is Meghan and I love kids! I have been nannying two 9-year-olds, an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old since September, and I have absolutely loved it. Besides my recent nannying experience, I have worked with kids in many other capacities as well. I have been babysitting since I was 12, and have also been a camp counselor for 3 summers, working and living with kids from ages 6-16. Additionally, I have spent lots of time taking care of my twin cousins from their birth to their teens, and my niece, who is now almost 3 years old. I have my MA and plan on applying to PhD programs in Psychology in the next two years. In addition to nannying, I currently coordinate 2 psychology studies at Stanford. I know all about child development and would create a safe, engaging, supportive, fun, growth environment for your child/children. I have been First Aid and CPR certified numerous times, as well as lifeguard certified, and am happy to get re-certified. I love being outside and going on adventures (no matter how big or small). I can tutor and would be happy to lead art projects and science experiments alike! Due to recent positive changes in my position at Stanford, and with my current families, I am now looking for a part-time position during weekday mornings for a couple/few hours. I am also open to midday and early afternoon positions. I am great at administrative and household tasks as well, in case you could use some extra help in those departments too. I am happy to provide background and driving checks upon request. I hope to hear from you soon!

Grace N. 
Child Care Provider — Mountain View, CA 
 I am a full-time student at Foothill College, where I am also able to adapt my schedule very quickly if needed.
My experience in child care simply comes from being apart of a large family. I enjoy working with children as I am very attentive to their needs and enjoy playful activities.
I am fluent in French and English, which I tutor twice a week. I adapt classes to any level, and choose to make them a fun and creative learning process with songs and activities for younger students.
Tutoring for about two years now, I am familiar with AP French Language and Culture exams.
Please let me know if you have further questions, I will get back to you as soon as possible.
I am looking forward to get to know you and your family,
Best.

City College Student As Nanny Available (Major In Child Development) — Mountain View, CA 
 Currently living in Mountain View, and accepting new families!!!
Hello there, I am an international student at City College San Francisco. I came all the way from Germany to study Child Development. It's a great experience and also a good way to learn from a different perspective. I worked as an internship for almost 6 months in a kindergarten in Dingolfing, Germany (Bavaria). I finished Fachoberschule Landshut (College of Further Education) in Psychology and Education. Also I speak English, Russian and German fluently (grew up bilingual and English was added in school). I like spending time with children to not only become a good friend and caring person who helps and bonds with them but to also become a better person. Children are Innocent and deserve the best!

Starting Sept1 Experienced, Responsible, Fun, Loving Nanny Ready To Take Care Of Your Family's Needs — Mountain View, CA 
 One of my first jobs when I was 20 was as a live in nanny for a family with 3 children. I have fond memories of my first family and I have simply continued to be a nanny because I love children. I enjoy helping children grow into wonderful, respectful individuals while maintaining a good sense of fun. In addition to being a nanny I have experience as a household manager. For the past 7 years I've worked for a high profile executive family, which my responsibilities included: all aspects of child care, scheduling and managing busy schedules, being a personal shopper, keeping the house organized and clean, dog care, sorting and organizing mail, managing bills and making payments, assisting in medical care/medication management, assisting in hiring/training new household staff.
As you can see I have an array of experience. My goal is to make your life easier by doing whatever needs being done and hopefully relieving you of stress so that you can enjoy your special time with your children.

Shauna S. 


(2) 

Babysitter — Mountain View, CA 
 For as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed spending time with children and interacting with them. At a young age, I would watch younger cousins for a brief amount of time but soon found myself babysitting neighbors children as well. I am currently a part time nanny for 3 girls who I have been taking care of for almost a year now. There are two twins who are 8 and they have an older sister who is 10. I pick them up from school, take them to soccer practice and often make them lunch/dinner depending on the time that I watch them. When they are not at practice, we are at home watching a movie, building a craft or playing games. I still often watch my neighbors children who are currently 4 and 10. Because I only watch them for "date night", my tasks include serving them dinner (if needed) and putting them to bed before a bed time story and teeth brushing! I'd like to think that I am a very hard working and easy going person so this comes in handy when working around younger kids.

Mimi G. 


(2) 

Part Time Or Possible Full Time Nanny — Mountain view, CA 
 I'm a nanny and a retired school nurse. I am a very caring and loving person who loves children. I feel children need to know that they are loved and given good/positive reinforcement. I do a lot of interaction with the children I care for: dancing, singing, and teaching. I love spending time outside in nature for the fresh air and sunshine. (Going to parks, going for walks, etc). I feel children need role models in their life to help them grow mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I take my nanny position seriously, it is not just a job to me. It's helping to mold a child to be "all they can be." They are our future.
Also, I have an active California LVN license, First Aid training and have an active CPR card.
If interested, please feel free to contact me.

Cheerful Part-time Caretaker Available — Mountain View, CA 
 My name is Guiuliana and I have over 20 years of experience caring for children from newborn to teens. I have four children of my own, but I have also cared for children as a profession. For the past 11 years I have worked as a translator from home for the Mountain View Whisman School District, but I supplement my income by doing something I love, babysitting! All the families I have worked for just love me and have great things to say about me. I love keeping the children engaged in fun and educational games that are age appropriate and love reading to
them and go on outings to the park, zoos, library, etc. A little more about me, I was born and raised in Peru, so I' m bilingual English/Spanish, in case you' re interested in your baby learning Spanish. Currently, I only have availability from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. I look forward to hearing from you and see if we' re a right fit!

The Christian faith for most people is not commuinicated by doctrinal pronouncements ... but by what goes on in the church in its most local setting. It is here, in the church down the street, that people are caught up in the Gospel promise -- or are turned away. - James C.

Sojo Community Comment Covenant

I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them. (Romans 12:17-21)
I will express my disagreements with other community members' ideas without insulting, mocking, or slandering them personally. (Matthew 5:22)
I will not exaggerate others' beliefs nor make unfounded prejudicial assumptions based on labels, categories, or stereotypes. I will always extend the benefit of the doubt. (Ephesians 4:29)
I will hold others accountable by clicking "report" on comments that violate these principles, based not on what ideas are expressed but on how they're expressed.  (2 Thessalonians 3:13-15)
I understand that comments reported as abusive are reviewed by Sojourners staff and are subject to removal. Repeat offenders will be blocked from making further comments. (Proverbs 18:7)
