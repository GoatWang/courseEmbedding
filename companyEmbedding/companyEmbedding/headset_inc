OtherThank you! Your submission has been received!Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the formIndustry ReportsWhat are the Most Popular Cannabis Products?June 29, 2016There are a lot more ways to get high than there used to be. Due to the legalization movement and proliferation of cannabis dispensaries, if marijuana users don’t feel like rolling themselves, they can pick up something pre-rolled. And if they don’t feel like smoking at all, they can get their high by eating a cookie or drinking a soda.So which products are most popular? And will Edibles or drinks ever become the primary way users get high? At Headset, our cannabis retailer transaction dataset accounts for about 25% of legal marijuana transactions in Washington state. We decided to use our data to understand which products consumers are buying most—and the dispensaries’ profit margins from these sales.According to the data, Flower, which is “traditional” marijuana bud, is still the most popular product with 49% of transactions compared to only 13% for Edibles, the next highest. But many non-traditional products like Live Resin, a special type of concentrate, and Carbonated Beverages are on the rise. We also found that while Flower is the most popular product, it is the least profitable product category for retailers. Edibles in the form of brittle and cake, pre-rolled blunts, and THC in pill form are the most profitable product typesAccounting for essentially half of all purchases, Flower remains an overwhelming favorite among consumers but a few new products seeing growth in excess of 20% per month could be indicating the start of a shift in the market.Which Products are the Most Popular?We began our analysis by looking at products from the broadest level. We grouped approximately two years of transactions by product category and calculated the percentage of total transactions involving a product from each group.Included in just under half of all transactions, Flower is by far the most popular product category. Edible and Pre-Roll are next at about 13% and 11.5% respectively. Concentrates and Vapor Pens, which are newer crazes among marijuana users, are in the middle of the pack. While we can attribute this mostly to  preference, it is possible that some of this difference is driven by the need to buy concentrates or oils less frequently due to higher potency.Each category can be broken down further into product types, so we conducted a similar analysis with more specific categories.Unsurprisingly, the top three products are all of the Flower variety. Hybrid Flower, in over 25% of all transactions, tops the list. Indica Flower, weed that gives the user a “body high”, is next at 11%, and Sativa Flower, weed that give the user a “head high”, follows shortly at 10%. Cartridges for Vapor Pens and Wax, which is typically consumed using a vapor pen but can also be consumed out of a bowl with Flower, round out the top five.A few surprising products crack the top 20 as well. Edibles such as Chocolate, Cookies and even Truffles rank above the famous weed brownie. Carbonated Beverages, a literal take on herb-infused drinks, which hit the shelves just two years ago, are the 13th most popular product.Which Products are Becoming More Popular?We also wanted to see if any products are growing in popularity. To examine this, we looked at the average monthly increase in product transactions over the last year.Want to read the rest?Fill out the form below to get access.

Our Heritage
It started with one small step




It all began in a garage in 1961 when two airline pilots set out to invent an alternative to the conventional headsets of commercial aviation. The product Courtney Graham and Keith Larkin created in that tiny garage in Santa Cruz, California was more than just the world's first lightweight headset. It was the birth of a company called Plantronics, and the first of a half-century of breakthroughs in communications. 
Plantronics made history when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and uttered those legendary words: through a Plantronics headset.



 

That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Reset your thinking about buying headsets

   More than 80% of wireless headsets are replaced needlessly because people don’t know how to care for them or fix minor problems. Instead of tossing perfectly good headsets, BTP customers have an ace up their sleeve resulting in less down time and big savings.
  





Would you rather save 5% today or 40% tomorrow?
It’s not crazy to want to save money. But when you think you’re saving a few bucks on your next headset from a discount retailer, maybe you are being a bit crazy. That’s because only BTP’s Lifetime Solution can save you up to 40% or more over the life of your headset. Saving you money with our Headset Help Desk's set-up, training and support is what the BTP advantage is all about.

Who we are

For over 25 years, we've been adding value to every purchase of professional wireless and corded headsets, as well as conference phones and a variety of unique telecom accessories. Providing the best support in the industry is why so many BTP customers keep coming back to us.
We know that IT managers and corporate buyers are under pressure to get the best price, but if you consider that the real bottom line is the cost of doing business including support and replacement it becomes clear that the lifetime cost of the product is what matters. By saving you time, money and maybe even a little bit of your sanity, we think we provide the best
 solution for the life of your Plantronics headsets and other quality communications products.
