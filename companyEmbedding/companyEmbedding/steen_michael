Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1758 edition. Language: lat. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Ienae [i.e. Jena] : Literis Schillianis 23 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 451003023

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At O'Steen, Michael J, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Douglas, GA area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Douglas, GA); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 912-383-8187, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.

Company Profile

Plum Quick was founded in 1981 by Carson Steen and his sons Rick and Robby. Below you will find some background information on the Steens and how Plum Quick came to be.
Carson Steen (Back to top)


Two
Three

My name is Carson Steen. I was born in Chesterfield County, South Carolina on Feb. 5th 1940. I was reared on a small farm and attended a rural four room school.


I started operating an automotive garage in Pageland, South Carolina in 1954 at 14 years of age. I married a home town girl in 1958, and moved to Fort Mill, SC and started working for Springs Cotton Mills, later known as Springs Industries.

In 1959 I had a son (Ricky) and another son in 1962 (Robby). Between 1963 and 1975, I entered York Technical College in Rock Hill S.C and completed nineteen electrical and mechanical courses. 

I later resigned from Springs Industries in 1981 to start Indian Land machine shop now known as Steen Products Inc. and then founded Plum Quick Motors with sons Ricky and Robby. I hold several patents on a variety of items including an electric vehicle drive axle.

Rick Steen (Back to top)


Two

My name is Rick Steen. I was born June 26th, 1960. My wife's name is Phyllis. Together, we have two sons, Matt, 24, and Dylan, 13.


I have always been interested in sports. At Indian Land High School, I was Quarterback from 1976-78 and competed in track from 1974-78. After High School, I attended Newberry College in Newberry SC.


Bodybuilding and powerlifting are some of my other interests. I started competing in bodybuilding professionally in 1982 and powerlifting professionally in 1985. Below, I have listed achievements from my bodybuilding and powerlifting career.

Robby Steen (Back to top)



My name is Robby Steen, I was born January 2nd 1962 in York County South Carolina to Carson and Kathleen Steen. My family and I moved to the community of Indian Land located in Lancaster County, Fort Mill SC at 6 weeks of age. I had a normal childhood breaking everything I could get my hands on and worrying my parents about my mental capabilities.


My very first memories of any mechanical ability was around 10 years old, when my uncle 'Shorty' would come to visit and show me his tricks on making a stick welder weld by itself in Dad's backyard shop. I was hooked on welding instantly from that point, and that bug is stronger than ever today.


I started rebuilding car engines at 15 and loved the fact that I could tear something down, put it back together and it would work! Who would have thought at that age you would know what you were going to do for the rest of your life?


I went to work full time for Springs Industries in 1979 while still in high school. I fixed weaving looms on the 2nd shift and thought it would kill me. In the cotton mills at that time, there was no air conditioning and the noise was unreal, but if you could work in that type of environment you could work anywhere.


I graduated from Indian Land High School in 1980 and I left Springs Industries in 1981 to work at Indian Land Machine Shop with my Father. In 1982, I married the love of my life and childhood sweetheart Sheila. In 2001, Sheila gave birth to our twin boys, Noah and Jacob. Sheila home schools the boys, and no, I do not know how she does it.


In the many years since Steen Products Inc. was established, we have done a wide variety of repair jobs from the textile industry to food packaging. Steen Products Inc. has many years of experience with research and development with companies throughout the world from electric riding lawn mowers to medical testing equipment. During that time, we have been granted
several U.S. and foreign patents.


Plum Quick Motors came about thru building our own golf carts to use at the shop and for trail riding, little did we know that it would turn into what it has become today, shipping electric golf cart motors worldwide!

At Plum Quick Motors, we are always looking at new motor designs that push the limits of torque and speed, and I can say with confidence that Plum Quick Motors will become the world leader in electric golf cart performance!


If I could leave you with one thing, always be supportive of your children in the things that they love to do. If they do the things they love, they will love the things they do, and you will too.


I thank the good Lord that I have parents that showed me that support!

Satisfied Customers

"I received and installed my new PQ D-310 motor yesterday and now my cart is "Plum Quick." It is a significant improvement in performance and I could not be happier. I truly appreciated Robby's candor and objectivity during our phone conversation. Robby took a lot of time to speak with me and answer my questions. It is absolutely clear to me that you are honest and professional people that are more interested in meeting the customer's needs than just selling them something to make a buck. It will be my pleasure to do business with you again in the future."
