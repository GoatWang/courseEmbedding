A Woodlands-based equity firm, which has funded new apartment development, has raised $6.7 million in equity funding, according to public records.
Six Pines Hamlin LLC reported the capital raise Nov. 16 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Florida-incorporated firm based in The Woodlands reported six investors for the capital raise, which means the average capital raised per investor was about $1 million. The minimum investment accepted from an outside investor was $101,422.

The fund, which recorded its first sale on Nov. 1, aimed to raise $6.7 million and has since reached that goal.




Ronald Gentzler, an executive with Six Pines Hamlin, could not be immediately reached for comment about the capital raise. Gentzler is the president of sister company Six Pines Realty LLC, a longtime equity firm based in The Woodlands. Six Pines Realty has been the equity partner on multifamily developments in Austin and Orlando.
Multifamily developers continue to find ways to raise capital for acquisitions and new construction projects despite the oil slump.
In April, The Dinerstein Cos. reported it raised $50 million in equity and investment funding. The Houston multifamily developer, which is planning to build a 40-story luxury apartment tower in Uptown, stated the capital raise was part of the company's annual capital markets activities.
In May, The Barvin Group reported it raised $16.5 million in equity funding. That same month, the Houston multifamily company acquired two apartment complexes in Houston.
