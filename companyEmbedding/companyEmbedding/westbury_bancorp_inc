 Westbury Bank is an independent community bank serving communities in Washington, Waukesha, Dane and Outagamie Counties through its eight full service offices and two loan production offices providing deposit and loan services to individuals, professionals and businesses throughout its markets.    Forward-Looking Information   Information contained in this press release, other than historical information, may be considered forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements in this release are inherently subject to many uncertainties arising in the Company's operations and business environment.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the Company's operating results, performance or financial condition are competition, the demand for the Company's products and services, the Company's ability to maintain current deposit and loan levels at current interest rates, deteriorating credit quality, including changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest margins, changes in prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions, the Company's ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity, the Company's ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks, and other factors as set forth in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company's expectations. Certain tabular presentations may not reconcile because of rounding. ___________________________________  WEBSITE:  www.westburybankwi.com                  At or For the Three Months Ended:         June 30,2017        March 31,2017        December 31,2016        September 30,2016        June 30,2016        Selected Financial Condition Data:     (Dollars in thousands)    Total assets   $ 795,915     $ 755,541     $ 732,996     $ 702,625     $ 670,778     Loans receivable, net   571,281     551,611     543,220     533,759     519,332     Allowance for loan losses   5,612     5,560     5,451     5,244     5,062     Securities available for sale   122,338     115,208     101,997     93,772     87,254     Total liabilities   716,124     676,461     654,684     622,996     591,696     Deposits   687,486     645,313     629,852     591,977     563,515     Stockholders' equity   79,791     79,080     78,312     79,629     79,082                      Asset Quality Ratios:                Non-performing assets to total assets   0.04 %   0.07 %   0.10 %   0.09 %   0.08 %   Non-performing loans to total loans   0.03 %   0.09 %   0.13 %   0.10 %   0.11 %   Total classified assets to total assets   0.32 %   0.85 %   0.47 %   0.28 %   0.31 %   Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans   2,806.00 %   1,079.61 %   775.39 %   933.10 %   900.71 %   Allowance for loan losses to total loans   0.97 %   1.00 %   0.99 %   0.97 %   0.96 %   Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans -

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
