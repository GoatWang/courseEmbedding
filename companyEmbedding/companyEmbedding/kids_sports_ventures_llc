New Jersey Could Host Franchise in Professional Cricket League

East Brunswick's Jay Pandya, Chair of Global Sports Ventures, sponsors of the Cricket League

EAST BRUNSWICK, NJ - Global Sports Ventures LLC, a sports development company headed by Chairman Jignesh “Jay” Pandya, has selected East Brunswick as one of eight U.S. cities to host a franchise in the fledgling U.S. Cricket League.
By 2020, East Brunswick will be home to a state-of-the-art mixed-use complex, comprising a cricket stadium, parking, club house, restaurants, hotels, retail, residential and office space, according to Pandya.
"I am enthusiastic about this league and several other sports proposals for the township and would be open to seeing any plans." said Mayor Brad Cohen.Sign Up for E-News
U.S. Cricket League estimates the first eight stadiums and surrounding developments will represent a $2.4 billion investment and create approximately 17,000 jobs nationwide. The organization has taken a major step forward by tapping JLL’s Sports and Entertainment Group as its overall real estate advisor to assist organizers in the development of multiple stadium and mixed-use projects in eight charter cities. JLL has commenced the site selection process.
“We know our plans are ambitious, and GSV is committed to launching a professional cricket league in the U.S. by 2020,” Pandya said. “JLL will be a key partner in this endeavor. We are quite impressed with the job they did with the Atlanta Braves at SunTrust Park and The Battery, and other similar stadium centric assignments across the country.
Specifically, the JLL Sports & Entertainment Group will provide Global Sports Ventures, a sports development company headed by Chairman Jignesh “Jay” Pandya, with site selection, negotiations and advisory services, as well as oversee development of eight stadiums and adjacent mixed-use “lifestyle” centers across the country.
The U.S. Cricket League will comprise eight charter locations in states where cricket already has a highly established following: New York, New Jersey; Washington, DC; Georgia; Florida; Texas; Illinois and California. The U.S. Cricket League will expand into four to six additional markets after its initial launch in 2020, according to Pandya.











JLL  has commenced the site selection process for the new stadiums and mixed-use developments and is reviewing multiple sites within the eight targeted markets, said David Demarest, International Director at JLL. The cricket stadiums are expected to cost between $70-125M with the ancillary developments adding an additional $80-100M each of mixed use product. The group expects to initial targeted sites shortly.
“Our Sports & Entertainment Group is in the unique position of offering development advisory services for each step of this important process,” Demarest said of helping GSV create a new sports league. “We will leverage the overall JLL services platform together with our experience with the Braves and other sports development assignments.  Each cricket-anchored development will create hundreds of temporary and permanent jobs to the local economies and enhance the overall infrastructure for each community.”
The JLL Sports & Entertainment Group provided the entire spectrum of real estate and advisory services for the Atlanta Braves, which opened SunTrust Park and the adjacent mixed-use development called The Battery in April. Services JLL provided included site selection and acquisition, master planning joint venture negotiations, financing, entitlements, and project management.

By Jeff Beer1 minute ReadNo matter where you are in the world, sports are a huge part of kids’ lives. Consequently, so is getting hurt with bumps, bruises, and even broken bones. These are the rites of passage for many a-growing athlete. We all know this, so understandably, parents can get a bit nervous for the safety of their child. But there’s a big difference between making sure your kid is protected and pushing that protection so far that you actually prevent the child from playing hard and building their skills.advertisementIn an effort to ease the concerns of overprotective parents in China, Nike and agency Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai created a series of bandages aimed at taking the focus off potential injury, and on the kids’ dedication and commitment. The “Badge of Honor” series is four different sets of 14 bandages that are designed for basketball, running, soccer, and skateboarding, and packaged in specially-designed sleeves that unfold into comic strips. The comics tell stories about young athletes who played hard, fell down, and then had the courage to get back up again.It’s a good message, but let’s be honest, it’s also a pretty creative way for Nike to get yet another swoosh plastered on a young athlete. Given how Band-Aid pretty much owns the market for licensed bandages by soothing kiddie boo-boos with Star Wars, Spongebob Squarepants, Barbie, and more, it’s no surprise Nike’s looking to slap its logo on all that extra real estate around our kids’ knees and elbows.advertisementRelated StoriesEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” and “Ready Player One” Trailers Are Peak ’80s NostalgiaEntertainmentHow The World’s Biggest Comedy Festival Is Leading The Industry’s ChargeEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FaradvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasGoogle’s Quest To Develop A Plant-Based “Power Dish” More Popular Than MeatIdeasThese 14 Social Entrepreneurs Are Getting A Boost From Red BullIdeasThis App Connects Veterans In Crisis With Other Veterans Who Are Willing To TalkEntertainmentEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” and “Ready Player One” Trailers Are Peak ’80s NostalgiaEntertainmentHow The World’s Biggest Comedy Festival Is Leading The Industry’s ChargeEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarCo.DesignInnovation By DesignBiased AI Is A Threat To Civil Liberties.

I am very upset by this after hearing my child and their new vocabulary! Teachers fight in front of children and parents, cry, and talk about theirs and others problems. At this point its more of a building with electricity, than AWESOME and WHOLESOME care for our kids.

She brings her own problems into the center. Her divorce and struggle to pay bills is really none of me or my childs concern. Also they promote the fact that there is only one tv in the center but every morning I went in all the kids were packed around the ONE tv. Kelly also tried to find right in leaving my son at school in which my sister had to go pick him up as the driver of the bus told the school that he was a car rider.
