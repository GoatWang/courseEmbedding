August 2, 2005
 
Mr. William F.
Ritzmann
President & CEO
United Community Bank
92 Walnut Street
Lawrenceburg, IN 47025
 
Dear Mr. Ritzmann:
 
This proposal is being submitted in
connection with the proposed minority stock offering (the
“Offering”) by a new holding company (the
“Company”), the mid-tier stock holding company of
United Community Bank (the “Bank”). The Company and the
Bank are referred to collectively as the “Company”. The
Offering will be made pursuant to the Company’s Stock
Issuance Plan (the “Plan”) to eligible depositors and
others in a Subscription Offering, with any remaining shares
offered to the general public in a Community Offering.
 
Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.
(“KBW”) will act as the Company’s exclusive
financial advisor and marketing agent in connection with the
Offering. This letter sets forth selected terms and conditions of
our engagement.
 
1. Advisory/Offering Services .
As the Company’s financial advisor and marketing agent, KBW
will provide the Company with a comprehensive program of services
designed to promote an orderly, efficient, cost-effective and
long-term stock distribution. KBW will provide financial and
logistical advice to Company concerning the Offering and related
issues. KBW will provide Offering enhancement services intended to
maximize stock sales in the Subscription Offering and to residents
of the Bank’s market area, if necessary, in the Community
Offering.
 
KBW shall provide financial advisory
services to the Company which are typical in connection with an
equity offering and include, but are not limited to, overall
financial analysis of the Company with a focus on identifying
factors which impact the valuation of the common stock.
 
Additionally, post Offering financial
advisory services will include advice on shareholder relations,
after-market trading, dividend policy (for both regular and special
dividends), stock repurchase strategies and communication with
market makers. Prior to the closing of the Offering, KBW shall
furnish to client a Post-Offering reference manual, which will
include specifics relative to these items. (The nature of the
services to be provided by KBW as the Company’s financial
advisor and marketing agent is further described in Exhibit A
attached hereto.)

2. Preparation of Offering
Documents . The Company and its counsel will draft the
registration statement, Offering application, prospectus and other
documents to be used in connection with the Offering. KBW will
attend meetings to review these documents and will advise you on
their form and content. KBW and its counsel will draft an
appropriate agency agreement and related documents as well as
marketing materials other than the prospectus.
 
3. Due Diligence Review . Prior
to filing the registration statement, Offering application or any
offering or other documents naming KBW as the Company’s
financial advisor and marketing agent, KBW and its representatives
will undertake substantial investigations to learn about the
Bank’s and Company’s business and operations
(“due diligence review”) in order to confirm
information provided to us and to evaluate information to be
contained in the Company’s offering documents. The Company
and the Bank agree that they will make available to KBW all
relevant information, whether or not publicly available, which KBW
reasonably requests, and will permit KBW to discuss with management
the operations and prospects of the Bank. KBW will treat all
material non-public information as confidential. The Company
acknowledges that KBW will rely upon the accuracy and completeness
of all information received from the Company, its officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, accountants and
counsel, including this letter to serve as the Company’s
financial advisor and marketing agent.
 
4. Regulatory Filings . The Bank
and/or the Company will cause appropriate Offering documents to be
filed with all regulatory agencies including the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the National Association
of Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the Office of Thrift
Supervision (“OTS”), and such state securities
commissioners as may be determined by the Company.
 
5. Agency Agreement . The
specific terms of KBW’s services, including stock offering
enhancement and syndicated offering services contemplated in this
letter, shall be set forth in a mutually agreed upon Agency
Agreement between KBW and the Bank and the Company to be executed
prior to commencement of the Offering, and dated the date that the
Company’s prospectus is declared effective and/or authorized
to be disseminated by the appropriate regulatory agencies, the SEC,
the NASD, the OTS, and such state securities commissioners and
other regulatory agencies as required by applicable law.
 
6. Representations, Warranties and
Covenants . The Agency Agreement will include representations,
warranties and covenants mutually agreeable to the Company and KBW,
and will provide that the Company will indemnify KBW and its
controlling persons (and, if applicable, the members of the selling
group and their controlling persons), and that KBW will indemnify
the Bank and the Company against certain liabilities including,
without limitation, liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933.
 


Mr. William F.
Ritzmann

7. Fees . For the services
hereunder, the Company shall pay the following fees to KBW at
closing unless stated otherwise:
 


 
(a)
Management Fee. A Management Fee of $50,000 payable in
four consecutive monthly installments of $12,500 commencing with
the adoption of the Plan. Such fees shall be deemed to have been
earned when due. Should the Offering be terminated for any reason
not attributable to the action or inaction of KBW, KBW shall have
earned and be entitled to be paid fees accruing through the stage
at which point the termination occurred.


 


 
(b)
Success Fee: A Success Fee of 1.50% shall be charged
based on the aggregate Purchase Price of Common Stock sold in the
Offering excluding shares, contributed to a foundation, purchased
by the Bank’s officers, directors, or employees (and members
of their immediate family) plus any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock
based compensation plans (except IRAs held by persons other than
the Bank’s officers, directors or employees or their
immediate family) or similar plan created by the Bank or the
Company for some or all of their directors or employees. The
Management Fee described in 7(a) will be applied against the
Success Fee.


 


 
(c)
Broker-Dealer Pass-Through. If any shares of the
Company’s stock remain available after the Subscription
Offering and Community Offering, at the request of the Company, KBW
will seek to form a syndicate of registered broker-dealers to
assist in the sale of such common stock on a best efforts basis,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the selected
dealers agreement. KBW will endeavor to distribute the common stock
among dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution
objectives of the Company and the Plan. KBW will be paid a fee not
to exceed 5.5% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the shares of
common stock sold by them. From this fee, KBW will pass onto
selected broker-dealers, who assist in the syndicated community, an
amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at
such time for comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable
price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect
to purchases effected with the assistance of a broker/dealer other
than KBW shall be transmitted by KBW to such broker/dealer. The
decision to utilize selected broker-dealers will be made by the
Company upon consultation

United Community Bancorp Announces Retirement of William F. Ritzmann

						 from   United Community Bancorp 











 
















































 

 




















 


LAWRENCEBURG, Ind., April 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- United Community Bancorp (the "Company") (Nasdaq:   UCBA), the holding company for United Community Bank (the "Bank"), announced today that William F. Ritzmann, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and the Bank has announced his retirement, effective June 30, 2014.
The Board of Directors also announced the appointment of Elmer ("E.G.") McLaughlin as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and the Bank, effective July 1, 2014. Mr. McLaughlin has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of United Community Bancorp since its formation in 2006, and of the Bank since it was formed in April 1999 as result of the merger between Perpetual Federal Savings and Loan Association and Progressive Federal Savings Bank.  Before the merger, Mr. McLaughlin served for nine years as President, and 19 years as a director, of Perpetual Federal. Prior to his appointment as President of Perpetual Federal, Mr. McLaughlin served as Executive Vice President and Head of Operations, and as a senior loan officer, of Perpetual Federal from 1978 until 1990. He has served as an officer and on the boards of directors of numerous community service organizations in the Lawrenceburg, Indiana area, and was born and raised in Lawrenceburg where he resides.  Mr. McLaughlin is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and received a Masters Degree in Economics from Indiana University.
Commenting on Mr. Ritzmann's retirement, Ralph Sprecher, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, "The Board of Directors could not be more grateful to Bill Ritzmann for his contributions to United Community Bank, United Community Bancorp and the communities and constituents that we serve. Our institution has benefitted from his leadership, character and vision since he first joined Progressive Federal Savings Bank's board in 1975. Together with E.G. McLaughlin, Bill has successfully guided the Bank and the Company through the extraordinary cycles that the financial services industry has endured during his tenure. While we wish Bill the best as he transitions his management responsibilities to E.G., we are delighted that we will continue to benefit from Bill's presence on the Company's and the Bank's Boards of Directors. We are also uniquely fortunate to be able to appoint E.G. McLaughlin as our new CEO and President. E.G. epitomizes the skill and experience of our management team and has worked closely with Bill to strengthen and position the Company for future success. He is a recognized business and community leader throughout Lawrenceburg and its surrounding communities.  We expect this management transition to be seamless."
"It has truly been a privilege to be a part of the United Community family for so many years," said Mr. Ritzmann. "United Community represents the best of what community banking seeks to achieve. I am very pleased that E.G. McLaughlin will be my successor, and sincerely echo the Board's sentiments regarding E.G."
"I am honored to be appointed as the new President and CEO of the institution that represents such a significant part of my personal and professional life," stated Mr. McLaughlin. "Having worked with Bill Ritzmann and the rest of the United Community management team and the Board for so many years, I am very confident that we are well positioned to help United Community continue to serve the best interests of its shareholders, customers and communities. I will work diligently to ensure the Bank's and Company's continued success and honor the legacy of Bill's stewardship." 
United Community Bancorp is the holding company of United Community Bank, headquartered in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.  The Bank currently operates eight offices in Dearborn County and Ripley County, Indiana.
