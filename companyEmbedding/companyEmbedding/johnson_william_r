William R. Johnson is an American businessman and is the former president, CEO and chairman of H. J. Heinz.[1]
He worked at Drackett as an assistant product manager for Behold furniture polish, starting at $13,000 a year. He worked at Ralston Purina, Frito-Lay and Anderson-Clayton Foods before joining Heinz in 1982 as general manager of new business.
In 1988, as president and CEO of the poorly performing Heinz Pet Products, he turned around a poorly performing operation which some analysts had proclaimed unsalvageable. In 1992, he did the same thing at the highly visible Starkist Foods. In 1993 he was named senior vice president and director, in 1996 president and COO, and in 1998, named president and CEO. In 2000, he became chairman as well.
Johnson is fiscally conservative, focusing on cost-containment, and the performance of major brands, as he faces stiff competition and pricing demands from wholesalers. He is described by coworkers as incredibly intense; he agrees with that assessment.
He credits his father, Bill "Tiger" Johnson with instilling him with a fiercely competitive spirit and a passionate desire to win. Tiger Johnson was a center for the San Francisco 49ers and then head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals. Johnson also learned motivation from his father and other coaches. In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he told reporter Patricia Sabatini that, "Some people need to be handled gently. Other people you can kick in the rear end" (May 18, 1998).
Johnson was born in, grew up in Palo Alto, and married his wife, Susie, in 1974. They have two children, Brad and Tracy, who are also pursuing careers in business. Bill is also a proud new grandfather, welcoming his grandson William Daniel Johnson on June 7, 2008.
On February 11, 2009, the Board of Directors of UPS (NYSE:UPS) elected William R. Johnson as a new independent director of the company.[2]
Education[edit]
Johnson earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1971. While a student at UCLA, he was initiated into the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity. Later, he moved to Austin, Texas to attend the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, from which he received a master's degree in Business Administration in 1974.

      ■ William R. Johnson was recruited to Heinz U.S.A. in 1982 and made
      a name for himself turning around Heinz's poorly performing
      StarKist and Pet Products divisions, which some industry analysts had
      considered unsalvageable. Johnson was appointed president and chief
      executive officer of H.J. Heinz Company in 1998 and was made chairman in
      2000. After taking over, Johnson focused on cost cutting and the
      performance of major brands to help turn Heinz around, as it had suffered
      from stiffer competition and pricing demands from wholesalers. Johnson was
      described by himself and coworkers alike as incredibly intense; industry
      analysts noted that Johnson was a fiscal conservative and dedicated cost
      cutter.

          . 
        


      LIFE IS LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME
    

      Johnson's father, Bill "Tiger" Johnson, was a center
      for the San Francisco Forty-Niners professional football team and later
      the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals. According to Johnson, who grew
      up in Palo Alto, California, following his father's career helped
      instill him with a fiercely competitive spirit and a passionate distaste
      for losing. He credited his father as being a major influence on his life
      and continued to take advice from him throughout his career. Johnson said
      he also learned how to motivate people by examining the methods used by
      his father and other coaches. In an interview with Patricia Sabatini for
      the 
      
        Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
      
      , Johnson noted, "Some people need to be handled gently. Other
      people you can kick in the rear end" (May 18, 1998).
    

      After receiving his master's in business administration from the
      University of Texas–Austin in 1974, Johnson went to
       work briefly for Ralston Purina in St. Louis and then Frito-Lay in
      Dallas. In 1979 he joined Clayton Foods, also in Dallas, and quickly
      impressed the company's CEO. Before long, he was made vice
      president of marketing and of the consumer product group. As the then CEO
      Rick Avery later recalled, Johnson was results oriented, and every year he
      was with the company the bottom line went up.
    

      ESTABLISHING "PRICE-BASED COSTING"
    

      Johnson's success at Clayton Foods caught the attention of the
      Heinz Company, which began to recruit him. Avery said he fought off
      Heinz's advances but knew he had lost the war when Heinz sent a
      corporate jet to pick Johnson and his wife up for a meeting. Johnson
      joined Heinz U.S.A. in 1982 as general manager of new business and was
      later appointed general manager of marketing.
    

      In 1988 Johnson was made president of Heinz's Pet Products division
      and four years later he took over one of the company's most visible
      divisions, StarKist Foods. As the head of these divisions Johnson reached
      new heights, successfully turning them around partly through a process he
      helped pioneer called "price-based costing." The traditional
      formula of 1980s business was the simple equation, cost plus margin equals
      the price of the product. In the new business era of the 1990s, with
      increased competition offering consumers more and more product choices,
      Johnson turned to the philosophy of determining what consumers were
      willing to spend and then doing whatever was necessary to be profitable at
      those prices. This goal was primarily met by slashing costs in every
      possible realm of the business. Johnson described the concept as simple
      but noted that its execution could be painful.
    

      Johnson's strategy at Pet Products and StarKist was a success. As
      sales and profits soared, so did Johnson's renown within the
      company. In 1993 he was named to Heinz's board and became a senior
      vice president responsible for Heinz's burgeoning operations in
      Asia Pacific. The experience would prove invaluable with respect to his
      eventual leadership of H.J. Heinz. In an interview for an alumni profile
      on the University of Texas–Austin Web site, Johnson noted,
      "Working overseas, you have to learn to be flexible, to adjudicate
      issues in local terminology" (March 3, 1998). He pointed out that
      each over seas market required a unique approach and marketing technique
      and that establishing a brand was often more important than seeking
      profits in the early stages.
    

      NAMED CEO
    

      In 1998 Johnson took over the position of CEO at Heinz from the longtime
      and popular CEO and chairman, Anthony J. F. O'Reilly. The first
      step Johnson took as CEO was to announce several top management
      appointments, as he installed his own senior administrative team. Unlike
      his predecessor, who was surrounded by older top executives, Johnson was
      intent on recruiting and promoting a new generation of younger talented
      executives, most in their 40s.
    

      Johnson also established that he would continue to be dedicated to cost
      cutting and to restructuring the company, which he had begun the year
      before through Heinz's Project Millennia. He also announced that he
      would centralize decisionmaking at Heinz's Pittsburgh headquarters
      and increase headquarters' role in tracking the performance of
      Heinz's numerous international operations.
    

      Some analysts feared that Johnson would be overeager in his cost-cutting
      wars with other large food companies. The Industry analyst Nomi Ghez also
      noted that Johnson was changing the centralized structure of the company
      and told Patty Tascarella, in an interview for the 
      
        Pittsburgh Business Times
      
      , that "the risk is to hurt a culture of a company while
      you're achieving efficiencies" (December 12, 1997).
      Nevertheless, many analysts saw Johnson as the right person for the job at
      the right time, because his strength in operations would help the company
      better compete in a tougher industry environment.
    

      FACED MANY CHALLENGES
    

      When he took over the reins at Heinz, Johnson was dealing with a
      much-changed business environment in the processed-food industry. For
      example, Heinz and most other food-product companies were facing increased
      competition from retail giants who were able to squeeze suppliers to keep
      costs down. In addition, low inflation was leaving little opportunity to
      raise prices, and more and more consumers were eating out. In a 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       article, Johnson noted, "You can no longer price your way to
      prosperity" (December 20, 1999).
    

      In 1998 Johnson announced that Heinz would consolidate its ketchup and
      condiment business into one advertising and brand-image account valued at
      $50 million. The move was made to establish a consistent worldwide image
      for Heinz ketchup that would be similar to images created by Coca-Cola and
      McDonald's. Johnson also set out to increase sales and cash flow
      while reducing company debt. He simplified the company's
      distribution chain by closing warehouses, outsourcing more work, trimming
      inventories, and disposing of slow-moving products. Johnson's
      strategy also included returning to basics by focusing on Heinz's
      core lines, including ketchup and condiments, frozen foods, and infant and
      nutritional products. In the process, Johnson oversaw the selling of
      Heinz's tuna and pet-food businesses in a $2.5 billion deal with
      Del Monte Foods.
    

      Johnson further restructured the company through programs such as the
      Operation Excel and Streamline initiatives.
       Nevertheless, Johnson and Heinz continued to struggle with the
      "good news–bad news" dilemma faced by many corporate
      food giants. In March 2003, the good news was that Heinz's 15 core
      brands were doing well, as evidenced by its U.S. ketchup sales garnering a
      60 percent share of the market and an overall sales increase of between 14
      and 15 percent in its European and Asian markets. However, Heinz reported
      only modest performance overall, with a net income of $151.6 million (43
      cents per share), down from the $201.7 million (57 cents per share) of a
      year earlier.
    

      In 2003 Heinz's stock was trading at approximately $30, a 25
      percent decline from the previous year. Furthermore, Heinz had a total of
      24 charges against earnings over the previous 26 quarters. Some analysts
      noted that Johnson's seemingly endless restructuring programs had
      earned little profit for shareholders. Others, however, were more
      optimistic of John-son's moves within the company. The industry
      analyst William Leach told David Shock for a 
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
       article, "I think people don't realize that this company,
      over many years, had cobbled together a messy portfolio of businesses, and
      the recent restructurings and assets sales will make Heinz
      healthier" (April 29, 2003).
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE: LOW-KEY AND PERSONAL
    

      In contrast to his predecessor, who was known as a raconteur who enjoyed
      the spotlight, coworkers and analysts described Johnson as decidedly
      low-key with an unpretentious and casual demeanor. On the other hand, his
      management style was described as hard charging and sometimes even
      brusque, but also refreshingly direct. In an interview with Tascarella for
      the 
      
        Pittsburgh Business Times
      
      , the lawyer Art Schwab noted, "Bill is incredibly detail oriented
      and focused on the objective that's before him at that
      moment" (December 12, 1997).
    

      Heinz employees described Johnson as a good-natured but demanding boss who
      set a clear agenda. He was noted for his approachable management style and
      his preference for conversing in person rather than via telephone or
      e-mails. Johnson himself commented that he didn't think exclusively
      about getting ahead because such an approach would get a manager in
      trouble. He told the 
      
        Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
      
       staff-writer Sabatini, "You become risk-averse and focus on trying
      to do what everyone thinks you ought to do as opposed to what you really
      ought to do" (May 18, 1998).
    

      Perhaps recalling his father's coaching days, Johnson described his
      approach to success in management and business as akin to a football game
      where heroic 99-yard kickoff returns are few and far between. However, as
      he noted in his alumni profile on the University of Texas–Austin
      Web site, "if you plan each play in your drive meticulously and
      execute it flawlessly, you can make one first down, then another, then
      another—until you've taken the ball across the finish
      line" (March 3, 1988).
    

      GETTING HEINZ ON TRACK
    

      In a meeting with investors and analysts in 2003 Johnson said that the
      company intended to introduce something new to their ketchup business
      every 12 to 18 months, such as the company's recent additions of
      colored ketchup and the Easy Squeeze! Bottle. In addition to focusing on
      Heinz's giant frozen-foods and condiments businesses,
      Johnson's strategy emphasized increasing international sales in its
      European and Asian markets. Johnson told investors that he wanted to
      establish six markets with more than $100 million in sales. In a 2004
      address to the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, Johnson said that Heinz
      was on track to meet its 2004 netsales, cash, and earnings goals. As
      reported by Business Wire, he added, "We have turned our U.S.
      food-service business around with 8 percent sales growth in the first half
      of fiscal 2004. We have exciting innovations planned for our U.S. and
      European brands, and we are on pace for record cash flow" (February
      18, 2004). Johnson also held positions as a member of the board of
      directors of Grocery Manufacturers of America and a director of the Clorox
      Company.

      cutter.

      LIFE IS LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME
    

      Johnson's father, Bill "Tiger" Johnson, was a center
      for the San Francisco Forty-Niners professional football team and later
      the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals. According to Johnson, who grew
      up in Palo Alto, California, following his father's career helped
      instill him with a fiercely competitive spirit and a passionate distaste
      for losing. He credited his father as being a major influence on his life
      and continued to take advice from him throughout his career. Johnson said
      he also learned how to motivate people by examining the methods used by
      his father and other coaches. In an interview with Patricia Sabatini for
      the 
      
        Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
      
      , Johnson noted, "Some people need to be handled gently. Other
      people you can kick in the rear end" (May 18, 1998).
    

      After receiving his master's in business administration from the
      University of Texas–Austin in 1974, Johnson went to
       work briefly for Ralston Purina in St. Louis and then Frito-Lay in
      Dallas. In 1979 he joined Clayton Foods, also in Dallas, and quickly
      impressed the company's CEO. Before long, he was made vice
      president of marketing and of the consumer product group. As the then CEO
      Rick Avery later recalled, Johnson was results oriented, and every year he
      was with the company the bottom line went up.
    

      ESTABLISHING "PRICE-BASED COSTING"
    

      Johnson's success at Clayton Foods caught the attention of the
      Heinz Company, which began to recruit him. Avery said he fought off
      Heinz's advances but knew he had lost the war when Heinz sent a
      corporate jet to pick Johnson and his wife up for a meeting. Johnson
      joined Heinz U.S.A. in 1982 as general manager of new business and was
      later appointed general manager of marketing.
    

      In 1988 Johnson was made president of Heinz's Pet Products division
      and four years later he took over one of the company's most visible
      divisions, StarKist Foods. As the head of these divisions Johnson reached
      new heights, successfully turning them around partly through a process he
      helped pioneer called "price-based costing." The traditional
      formula of 1980s business was the simple equation, cost plus margin equals
      the price of the product. In the new business era of the 1990s, with
      increased competition offering consumers more and more product choices,
      Johnson turned to the philosophy of determining what consumers were
      willing to spend and then doing whatever was necessary to be profitable at
      those prices. This goal was primarily met by slashing costs in every
      possible realm of the business. Johnson described the concept as simple
      but noted that its execution could be painful.
    

      Johnson's strategy at Pet Products and StarKist was a success. As
      sales and profits soared, so did Johnson's renown within the
      company. In 1993 he was named to Heinz's board and became a senior
      vice president responsible for Heinz's burgeoning operations in
      Asia Pacific. The experience would prove invaluable with respect to his
      eventual leadership of H.J. Heinz. In an interview for an alumni profile
      on the University of Texas–Austin Web site, Johnson noted,
      "Working overseas, you have to learn to be flexible, to adjudicate
      issues in local terminology" (March 3, 1998). He pointed out that
      each over seas market required a unique approach and marketing technique
      and that establishing a brand was often more important than seeking
      profits in the early stages.
    

      NAMED CEO
    

      In 1998 Johnson took over the position of CEO at Heinz from the longtime
      and popular CEO and chairman, Anthony J. F. O'Reilly. The first
      step Johnson took as CEO was to announce several top management
      appointments, as he installed his own senior administrative team. Unlike
      his predecessor, who was surrounded by older top executives, Johnson was
      intent on recruiting and promoting a new generation of younger talented
      executives, most in their 40s.
    

      Johnson also established that he would continue to be dedicated to cost
      cutting and to restructuring the company, which he had begun the year
      before through Heinz's Project Millennia. He also announced that he
      would centralize decisionmaking at Heinz's Pittsburgh headquarters
      and increase headquarters' role in tracking the performance of
      Heinz's numerous international operations.
    

      Some analysts feared that Johnson would be overeager in his cost-cutting
      wars with other large food companies. The Industry analyst Nomi Ghez also
      noted that Johnson was changing the centralized structure of the company
      and told Patty Tascarella, in an interview for the 
      
        Pittsburgh Business Times
      
      , that "the risk is to hurt a culture of a company while
      you're achieving efficiencies" (December 12, 1997).
      Nevertheless, many analysts saw Johnson as the right person for the job at
      the right time, because his strength in operations would help the company
      better compete in a tougher industry environment.
    

      FACED MANY CHALLENGES
    

      When he took over the reins at Heinz, Johnson was dealing with a
      much-changed business environment in the processed-food industry. For
      example, Heinz and most other food-product companies were facing increased
      competition from retail giants who were able to squeeze suppliers to keep
      costs down. In addition, low inflation was leaving little opportunity to
      raise prices, and more and more consumers were eating out. In a 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       article, Johnson noted, "You can no longer price your way to
      prosperity" (December 20, 1999).
    

      In 1998 Johnson announced that Heinz would consolidate its ketchup and
      condiment business into one advertising and brand-image account valued at
      $50 million. The move was made to establish a consistent worldwide image
      for Heinz ketchup that would be similar to images created by Coca-Cola and
      McDonald's. Johnson also set out to increase sales and cash flow
      while reducing company debt. He simplified the company's
      distribution chain by closing warehouses, outsourcing more work, trimming
      inventories, and disposing of slow-moving products. Johnson's
      strategy also included returning to basics by focusing on Heinz's
      core lines, including ketchup and condiments, frozen foods, and infant and
      nutritional products. In the process, Johnson oversaw the selling of
      Heinz's tuna and pet-food businesses in a $2.5 billion deal with
      Del Monte Foods.
    

      Johnson further restructured the company through programs such as the
      Operation Excel and Streamline initiatives.
       Nevertheless, Johnson and Heinz continued to struggle with the
      "good news–bad news" dilemma faced by many corporate
      food giants. In March 2003, the good news was that Heinz's 15 core
      brands were doing well, as evidenced by its U.S. ketchup sales garnering a
      60 percent share of the market and an overall sales increase of between 14
      and 15 percent in its European and Asian markets. However, Heinz reported
      only modest performance overall, with a net income of $151.6 million (43
      cents per share), down from the $201.7 million (57 cents per share) of a
      year earlier.
    

      In 2003 Heinz's stock was trading at approximately $30, a 25
      percent decline from the previous year. Furthermore, Heinz had a total of
      24 charges against earnings over the previous 26 quarters. Some analysts
      noted that Johnson's seemingly endless restructuring programs had
      earned little profit for shareholders. Others, however, were more
      optimistic of John-son's moves within the company. The industry
      analyst William Leach told David Shock for a 
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
       article, "I think people don't realize that this company,
      over many years, had cobbled together a messy portfolio of businesses, and
      the recent restructurings and assets sales will make Heinz
      healthier" (April 29, 2003).
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE: LOW-KEY AND PERSONAL
    

      In contrast to his predecessor, who was known as a raconteur who enjoyed
      the spotlight, coworkers and analysts described Johnson as decidedly
      low-key with an unpretentious and casual demeanor. On the other hand, his
      management style was described as hard charging and sometimes even
      brusque, but also refreshingly direct. In an interview with Tascarella for
      the 
      
        Pittsburgh Business Times
      
      , the lawyer Art Schwab noted, "Bill is incredibly detail oriented
      and focused on the objective that's before him at that
      moment" (December 12, 1997).
    

      Heinz employees described Johnson as a good-natured but demanding boss who
      set a clear agenda. He was noted for his approachable management style and
      his preference for conversing in person rather than via telephone or
      e-mails. Johnson himself commented that he didn't think exclusively
      about getting ahead because such an approach would get a manager in
      trouble. He told the 
      
        Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
      
       staff-writer Sabatini, "You become risk-averse and focus on trying
      to do what everyone thinks you ought to do as opposed to what you really
      ought to do" (May 18, 1998).
    

      Perhaps recalling his father's coaching days, Johnson described his
      approach to success in management and business as akin to a football game
      where heroic 99-yard kickoff returns are few and far between. However, as
      he noted in his alumni profile on the University of Texas–Austin
      Web site, "if you plan each play in your drive meticulously and
      execute it flawlessly, you can make one first down, then another, then
      another—until you've taken the ball across the finish
      line" (March 3, 1988).
    

      GETTING HEINZ ON TRACK
    

      In a meeting with investors and analysts in 2003 Johnson said that the
      company intended to introduce something new to their ketchup business
      every 12 to 18 months, such as the company's recent additions of
      colored ketchup and the Easy Squeeze! Bottle. In addition to focusing on
      Heinz's giant frozen-foods and condiments businesses,
      Johnson's strategy emphasized increasing international sales in its
      European and Asian markets. Johnson told investors that he wanted to
      establish six markets with more than $100 million in sales. In a 2004
      address to the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, Johnson said that Heinz
      was on track to meet its 2004 netsales, cash, and earnings goals. As
      reported by Business Wire, he added, "We have turned our U.S.
      food-service business around with 8 percent sales growth in the first half
      of fiscal 2004. We have exciting innovations planned for our U.S. and
      European brands, and we are on pace for record cash flow" (February
      18, 2004). Johnson also held positions as a member of the board of
      directors of Grocery Manufacturers of America and a director of the Clorox
      Company.
