History
 

1986: It all Started with a Napkin
In 1986, co-founders David Manning and Rodney Lunn spent a year of Saturdays developing a business plan that centered on surgery center development. Then with the business plan and a budget sketched out on an iced tea napkin, Manning and Lunn quit their jobs to pursue their entrepreneurial dream by launching Practice Development Associates (PDA).
From 1986 to 1992, AMSURG’s predecessor company consulted on the development of more than 75 surgery centers and around the country.
1992: AMSURG is Created and Establishes Dominance in Endoscopy Centers
Tom Cigarran, then President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of American Healthcorp [now known as Healthways, Inc. (NASDAQ:  HWAY)], along with American Healthcorp Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Henry Herr, played a strong role in structuring an initial capital investment by American Healthcorp and a group of private equity investors from Nashville in 1992. Concurrent with the capital infusion, the entity formally became AMSURG Corp., and its focus shifted away from surgery center consulting services towards development of a single specialty equity partnership model.
Building on PDA’s reputation in the gastroenterology (GI) community, AMSURG formed numerous endoscopy center partnerships. Since 1994, AMSURG has been the leading operator of GI endoscopy centers.
1997: AMSURG Goes Public
AMSURG became a public company listed on the NASDAQ exchange on December 3, 1997, after it was spun off from its former parent American Healthways, Inc. [formerly American Healthcorp, Inc., now known as Healthways Inc. (NASDAQ: HWAY)]. The primary purpose of the spinoff was to give AMSURG the capital it needed to continue to finance an aggressive growth strategy.
During 1997, AMSURG added 15 new centers, ending the year with 39 total centers in operation. As detailed in the first Annual Report, “AMSURG strengthened its position as the undisputed leader in the physician practice-based ambulatory surgery center business.”
1999-2000: AMSURG Revenues Top $100 Million for the First Time, and AMSURG Becomes a Leader in Ophthalmology Surgery Centers
In April 1999, AMSURG announced its first multiple center acquisition deal with a letter of intent to purchase majority ownership of 11 eye surgery centers affiliated with Physicians Resource Group, Inc. (PRG). At the time, PRG was one of the leading operators of practice-based eye surgery centers. Completion of the transaction in January pushed AMSURG’s ophthalmology business reach to 24 centers with a corporate revenue of $143,261,000.
By year-end 1999, the company had 63 ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) in operation and had posted double-digit increases in same-center revenues for two straight years. This growth in both the number of ASCs and level of productivity per center pushed overall company revenues to more than $100 million.
After reaching $100 million in revenues and becoming a leader in both Gastroenterology and Ophthalmology Centers, 2000 Forbes honor AMSURG on its annual list of “Best Small Companies.” In 2000, AMSURG ranked 139th and then improved its ranking to 79 the following year.
2002: AMSURG Reaches 100 Centers
Within two years of the recognition from Forbes, AMSURG reached a major milestone by acquiring its 100th center during the third quarter of 2002.
Since 2006, AMSURG has been the largest ASC provider, by number of centers, in the industry.
2007: Chris Holden is Named AMSURG President and CEO

In October 2007, Chris Holden joined AMSURG in as President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Director. Chris brought a new range of health care industry sector experiences and proven large-scale management expertise to the AMSURG senior management team.
AMSURG also launched a multispecialty ASC acquisition strategy in 2007, resulting in a four-fold increase in AMSURG’s multispecialty surgery center portfolio since that time.
2008: AMSURG Centers Reach One Million Procedures Performed
2008 marked the first time in company history that more than one million procedures were performed at AMSURG centers during a single year. Exceeding one million procedures also pushed company revenues to more than $600 million in 2008 and made it clear that the “small company” tag was becoming increasingly less accurate.
2010: StopColonCancerNow Goes Live
As AMSURG expanded its leadership position in GI endoscopy centers, it became a major force in helping drive participation rates for screening colonoscopies to new heights by the end of the 2000s. So in 2010, AMSURG launched our first consumer-facing awareness campaign: StopColonCancerNow. At its launch, StopColonCancerNow has more than 8,000 followers on Facebook and Twitter, and the campaign has received hundreds of millions impressions. StopColonCancerNow also sponsors National Screening Day, an annual campaign to get patients to have their first colon cancer screening on the first Friday in March, which is Colon Cancer Awareness Month. In its first year National Screening Day saw more than 1,000 first-time screened.
The success of StopColonCancerNow led to the launch of additional national awareness campaigns, including HemHealing in 2011, YourSightMatters in 2012 and MoreThanHeartburn in 2013.
2011: AMSURG Acquires National Surgical Care and Launches New Tools for Centers
On August 24, 2011, CEO Chris Holden announced the acquisition of National Surgical Care (NSC), based in Dallas, Texas. The NSC acquisition added 16 centers and further diversified AMSURG’s ASC portfolio, substantially increasing its presence in the multi-specialty segment.
2011 was also a big year at AMSURG in terms of new capabilities, culminating with the launch of Center Connect, an administrative/communications portal for Center Leaders and staff. Center Connect marked a significant improvement in terms of both user experience and access to new content since all AMSURG resources, tools and targeted communications could now be accessed in one central location.
2012: Establishes Health System Strategy
Throughout the years, AMSURG had occasionally collaborated with hospitals and health systems to own and operate ASCs, although it had not been a focus. With the increasing pace of health care reform, AMSURG established a more formal program to seek strategic and synergistic partnerships with hospitals and health systems in 2012. Recognizing that each situation is unique, AMSURG has a flexible approach that assesses the advisability and suitability of partnering with a hospital or health system in each individual market the company currently serves or may serve in the future. AMSURG remains fully committed to partnering with physician-owned surgery centers that may wish to remain independent of hospital affiliations, while also acknowledging the value of exploring the strategic potential of aligning with hospital or health system partners under suitable circumstances.
2014: AMSURG Joins Forces with Sheridan Healthcare
The merger of AMSURG and Sheridan created a new powerhouse in health care that combines a strong national presence, leading market positions in multiple service lines and extensive local market expertise. The combined companies offer an unparalleled suite of solutions to help health systems executives navigate the changing health care landscape.
2016: Envision Healthcare and AMSURG Merge
The combination of Envision Healthcare and AMSURG brought together two leading, complementary healthcare companies to form one of the nation’s largest provider organizations, well positioned to help shape the future of healthcare delivery. Envision Healthcare manages a highly differentiated suite of clinical solutions to support health systems, communities and payors, is composed of a significantly diversified business mix of specialties, customers and geographies, and provides a broader continuum of patient care.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Company Summary


The Eye Surgery & Laser Center has been offering the highest quality eye care in the Central Florida areas of Winter Haven, Sebring and Lakeland since 2004. Our physicians have offices in both Winter Haven and Sebring. All of our physicians here at the surgery center are board certified. Your nursing staff will work together to make your surgery center stay a positive and pleasant experience. Our nursing staff has an average of 20 years experience. Having surgery can be a very overwhelming experience and we want our patients to know they can trust our team to provide them with the best medical care in the area. Each of our staff members is committed to making your stay comfortable and successful. Please feel free to ask questions and share concerns with any member of your health care team.  All of our staff at The Eye Surgery & Laser Center is certified in Basic Life support, with our registered nurses and anesthesiologists certified in Advanced Cardiac Life support as well. Staff members are required to take annual training in all aspects of your care. When patients choose to use an outpatient surgery center, also called an ambulatory surgery center (ASC), most find that the process is much more convenient, as well as more personal. Our center offers a relaxed environment with medical staff focused on offering individualized patient care. Our specialized staff helps each patient's visit go as quickly and smoothly as possible.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by:

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
