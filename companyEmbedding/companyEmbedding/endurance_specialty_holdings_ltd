These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Bitcoin surges as miners avert split for now
              
               Bitcoin continues to rise Saturday after miners back a software upgrade in a move that appears to avert a potential split of the digital currency into multiple versions.

Euro rally has room to run if this pattern continues to hold true

Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda-based specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, has launched a new workers’ compensation insurance product for its Global Risk Solutions clients. Global Risk Solutions, a new business line launched earlier this year within Endurance Insurance, targets middle market and large account risk management clients within select global industry verticals.
The new platform, headed by Michael Chang, CEO of Global Risk Solutions, writes all property and casualty lines of business and is initially focused on the real estate & hospitality, financial institutions and professional services industries in the U.S.
According to Chang, the addition of the Workers’ Compensation policy complements Global Risk Solutions’ portfolio of product offerings and will open up additional opportunities to Endurance.
Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. is a global specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. Through its operating subsidiaries, Endurance writes agriculture, professional lines, property, marine and energy, and casualty and other specialty lines of insurance and catastrophe, property, casualty, professional lines and specialty lines of reinsurance.
