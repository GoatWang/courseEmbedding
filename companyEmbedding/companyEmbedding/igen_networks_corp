It is publicly traded on the OTCQB under the symbol IGEN, and listed on the CSE under the symbol IGN. For more information, please visit www.igen-networks.com.  Forward-Looking Statements  This news release may contain forward-looking statements or forward looking information within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities law. The terms and phrases "goal", "commitment", "guidance", "expects", "would", "will", "continuing", "drive", "believes", "indicate", "look forward", "grow", "outlook", "forecasts", "intend", and similar terms and phrases are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by IGEN in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that IGEN believes are appropriate in the circumstances, including but not limited to statements regarding investment liquidity, financing options and long term goals of the Company, general economic conditions, IGEN's expectations regarding its business, customer base, strategy and prospects, and IGEN's confidence in the cash flow generation of its business. Many factors could cause IGEN's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: risks related to competition; IGEN's reliance on key personnel; IGEN's ability to maintain and enhance its brand; and difficulties in forecasting IGEN's financial results, particularly over longer periods given the rapid technological changes, competition and short product life cycles that characterize the mobile application industry. These risk factors and others relating to IGEN that may cause actual results to differ are set forth in the under the heading "Risk Factors" in IGEN's periodic filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (copies of which filings may be obtained at   www.sedar.com   or   EDGAR  ).

What We do:
IGEN’s works with privately held technology companies to help accelerate their growth. We work closely with these companies through sourcing of management expertise, capital, and expansion of distribution channels. We often describe ourselves as an “invasive” technology accelerator, in that we take active managerial roles to help mitigate operational risk and realize revenue growth and capital appreciation.
 
We are focused on companies in emerging, high growth technologies and solutions in one of three areas:

cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) business applications and
Machine to Machine (M2M) applications and technologies.

 
A secondary part of IGEN’s business is negotiating distribution agreements with relevant organizations and selling their products and services through the distribution channels of our portfolio companies, or newly developed global IGEN sales channels.
 
The IGEN management team  and advisory board bring years of business expertise across a broad range of disciplines that account for over $500M of value creation for shareholders, business partners, and customers. The IGEN team averages 30+ years of experience in developing and marketing disruptive technology that includes wireless data content, Software-as-a-Service cloud computing solutions and  M2M based applications .
