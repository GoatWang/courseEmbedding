Why Elephant Talk Communications (ETAK) Is Down Today
Elephant Talk Communications (ETAK) fell Tuesday after the company, which provides Software Defined Network Architecture (Software DNA 2.0) platforms and cyber security solutions, announced a delay in its reporting of fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. Elephant Talk had scheduled its report and investor conference call for Tuesday, March 18 but elected to postpone those two events to have more time to review its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, "including how its losses to date, when combined with the Company's recently completed financing efforts would impact the company's liquidity position," according to a press release. The conference call is now scheduled for Wednesday, March 26 at 11 a.m. ET.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  Any forward looking statements made herein are based on current expectations of the Company, involve a number of risks and uncertainties and should not be considered as guarantees of future performance. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: interruptions or cancellation of existing contracts, inability to integrate acquisitions, impact of competitive products and pricing, product demand and market acceptance risks, the presence of competitors with greater financial resources than the Company, product development and commercialization risks, changes in governmental regulations, and changing economic conditions in developing countries and an inability to arrange additional debt or equity financing.  Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements  As discussed in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our unaudited quarterly financial information (i) for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2013 and (ii) for the first three quarters in the year ended December 31, 2014 (collectively, the "Restated Periods"). We have restated the revenues and deferred revenues as a result of  The Company has corrected the manner in which it records revenue for its arrangements with multiple-element features and will also enhance its documentation related to its revenue recognition policies and practices. See "Controls and Procedures" included in Part II, Item 9A of the 2014 Form 10-K.  As a result of our restatement and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenue that had originally been recognized in 2013 is now being recognized ratably over an extended timeframe. The amount of revenue earned or to be earned over the entire period of recognition essentially remains unchanged from the amount we historically recognized. There was neither a change to the cash characteristics of the transactions being restated nor the Company's liquidity directly relating to these transactions. As a result of the restatement, the balance sheet reflects a significant increase in deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue over a number of years.  Overview  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this document.  Recent milestones for mobile product line:  � Early August 2015 the Company, jointly with its technology partner HP (Hewlett Packard), published a new case study on its collaboration with the Company entitled, "Elephant Talk Communications transforms mobile service enablement with HP iHSS." The case study examines the many benefits resulting from the integration of its new HP Integrated Home Subscriber Server (iHSS) technology into the ET Software DNA(R) 2.0 Software Defined Networking platform currently deployed with mobile network operator (MNO) and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) customers.  � On July 22, 2015 the Company announced that it has completed its initial restructuring efforts as part of its strategic plan to improve operational efficiencies, increase sales efforts and reduce expenditures. The plan includes eliminating approximately $5 million in 2015 from its annual cash operating SG&A budget consisting of a reduction in staff, elimination of office locations and a focus towards securing and supporting a growing number of Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) customers in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The Board-approved restructuring plan was the result of the need to refocus the business following the end of the Company's relationship with Iusacell its acquisition by AT&T earlier this year, the subsequent financial settlement and the resulting restructuring and reduction of its outstanding debt obligations.As part of the restructuring, the Company has divided its operations into two organizations - Delivery & Operations led by Co-President Dr. Armin Hessler and Sales & Innovation led by Co-President Martin Zuurbier. Delivery & Operations will be responsible for platform architecture, implementation and operations and Sales & Innovation will be responsible for all commercial activities, vendor management and R&D. With this business realignment, both divisions have made adjustments to their respective organizations to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs.  � On June 16, 2015 the Company announced that after a productive commercial relationship lasting several years, Grupo Iusacell ("Iusacell") and Elephant Talk have ended their relationship, agreeing to a global settlement worth approximately $13.5 million in favor of Elephant Talk, consisting of 12.6 million in cash and the remaining balance in exchange for certain obligations of Elephant Talk to Iusacell. The cash payment will be reflected as revenue on the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The reason for the termination was to allow for AT&T to ensure consistency of infrastructure suppliers in its businesses. The amicable parting of the companies in no way reflects on the performance of Elephant Talk or its technology and neither parties rule out the possibility of future business relationships.  � On May 28, 2015 the Company announced that the Company's software platform was chosen by OpenMobile, a new MVNO in the Netherlands, to support its commercial launch. OpenMobile (www.openmobile.nl) specializes in offering secure connectivity services to the consumer and enterprise markets.  � On April 29-30, 2015 Elephant Talk North America was invited to be present at the Verizon Partner Summit in Miami as one of three vendors participating, along with Coriant and Cisco. Elephant Talk North America was highlighted from the stage as the intended partner to power VPS's new pre-paid MVNO offerings in North America. In the United States ETNA will, if selected, provide the platform for VPS's Pre-Paid program as a branded "Powered by Elephant Talk" solution.  Recent milestones for the ValidSoft security product line:  � On May 12, 2015 ValidSoft announced that the Company has been selected as the preferred voice biometrics technology provider for ImageWare Systems going forward. ImageWare(R) Systems, Inc. (otcqb:IWSY) is a market leader in providing identity management solutions, delivering a single platform of best in class biometric solutions to manage millions of identities worldwide with a varied client and partner portfolio including TransUnion, Fujitsu, IBM and CA Technologies.  � On April 1, 2015 ValidSoft announced the signing of a significant new commercial customer contract for its newly enhanced User Authentication platform featuring its Voice Biometric technology with a large US-based corporation.  � On February 24, 2015 ValidSoft announced that it has launched its Device Trust solution with another major UK retail bank with its partner FICO

The new client, unnamed for security reasons, is the largest UK deployment of this solution to date for ValidSoft.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, rebates, allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation expense, long-lived asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, self-insurance, restructuring costs, litigation and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2014 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Comparison of three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.  Revenue  Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was $19,244,383 and $24,257,399, an increase of $14,171,943 or 279%, compared to $5,072,440 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and $13,800,694 or 132% compared to $10,456,705 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This increase was mainly caused by the full release of deferred revenue of $11,571,458 related to the termination of the contract with Iusacell as well as compensation paid by Iusacell in June 2015 for the termination of the contract.   Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Landline Services $ - $ 42,499 $ (42,499 ) Mobile & Security Solutions 19,244,383 5,029,941 14,214,442 Total Revenue $ 19,244,383 $ 5,072,440 $ 14,171,943 Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Landline Services $ - $ 141,230 $ (141,230 ) Mobile & Security Solutions 24,257,399 10,315,475 13,941,924 Total Revenue $ 24,257,399 $ 10,456,705 $ 13,800,694  Non-GAAP Revenue  In order to provide investors additional information regarding our revenue, we include here the discussion of Non-GAAP revenue. Our non-GAAP financial measure is defined as GAAP revenue adjusted for changes in deferred revenue. We believe this Non-GAAP measure provides useful information regarding our actual billings to our customers during the period which generally reflect the usage rates of our hosted platforms and security solutions. The presentation of Non-GAAP revenue is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue, for each of the periods indicated, is as follows:   Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Revenue $ 19,244,383 $ 5,072,440 $ 14,171,943 Deferred Revenue adjustments (11,871,208 ) 1,727,530 (13,598,738 ) Non-GAAP Revenue $ 7,373,175 $ 6,799,970 $ 573,205  Non-GAAP Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $ 7,373,175, an increase of $573,205 or 8.4%, compared to $6,799,970 for the three months ended June 30, 2014.  The negative impact on revenue of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $633,365. Revenue adjusted for this exchange rate effect increased for these three months by $1,206,570 compared with the same period prior year.   Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Revenue $ 24,257,399 $ 10,456,705 $ 13,800,694 Deferred Revenue adjustments (8,889,549 ) 2,537,091 (11,426,640 ) Non-GAAP Revenue $ 15,367,850 $ 12,993,796 $ 2,374,054  Non-GAAP Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $ 15,367,850, an increase of $2,374,054 or 18.3%, compared to $12,993,796 for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  The negative impact on revenue of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $ $1,426,289. Revenue adjusted for this exchange rate effect increased for the six months by $3,800,343 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2014.  The three and six month revenue increases were primarily caused by the increased usage rates of our Iusacell platform as well as the Iusacell settlement proceeds.

Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization.  Cost of service for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 was $1,440,914, a decrease of $(407,773) or 22%, compared to $1,848,687 for the three month period ended March 31, 2014.  The positive impact of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $214,437.  Cost of service expenses adjusted for this exchange rate effect decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2015 by $193,336 compared to three months ended June 30, 2014.  The decrease was the net result of decrease in staff expenses of $54,287 and $449,228 lower stock based compensation expenses. These decreases were partly offset by the increase in cost of mobile bundled service business and network of $310,179.  Margin (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment for assets held and used) as a percent of the total revenue was 93% and 64% for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase was primarily related to the increased revenue as discussed below.  The negative impact on margin of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months was $418,928. Margin adjusted for this exchange rate effect increased for the three months by $14,998,644. This increase was mainly caused by the full release of deferred revenue of $11,571,458 related to the termination of the contract with Iusacell as well as compensation paid by Iusacell for termination of the contract.   Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Revenues $ 19,244,383 $ 5,072,440 $ 14,171,943 Cost of service 1,440,914 1,848,687 (407,773 ) Margin (excluding depreciation and amortization) $ 17,803,469 $ 3,223,753 $ 14,579,716  Cost of service for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 was $3,309,760, a decrease of $174,899 or 14%, compared to $3,484,659 for the six month period ended June 30, 2014.  The positive impact of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the six months was $440,364. Cost of service expenses adjusted for this exchange rate effect increased for the six months by $265,466 compared to the same period last year.  The increase was primarily related to an increase in cost of mobile bundled service business and network of $616,484, increase in cost of service related management & personnel expenses of $264,598 and an off-setting $615,616 reduction of non-cash related expenses.  Margin (excluding depreciation and amortization) as a percent of the total revenue was 86% and 67% for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The negative impact on margin of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the six months was $985,925. Margin adjusted for this exchange rate effect increased for the six months by $14,961,518. This increase was mainly caused by the full release of deferred revenue of $11,571,458 related to the termination of the contract with Iusacell as well as compensation paid by Iusacell for termination of the contract.   Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 restated Variance Revenues $ 24,257,399 $ 10,456,705 $ 13,800,694 Cost of service 3,309,760 3,484,659 (174,899 ) Margin (excluding depreciation and amortization) $ 20,947,639 $ 6,972,046 $ 13,975,593  Product Development  Product Development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company's services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and ET BOSS & IN platform development and testing are included in this function.  Costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company's operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors. During the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company capitalized $1,114,332 and $1,231,889, respectively. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company capitalized $2,289,359 and $2,287,851, respectively.  Product Development costs for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $1,490,683 and $ 2,280,532, respectively, a decrease of $789,849 or 35%. The decrease was primarily related to $777,085 less non cash related expenses versus the three month period ended June 30, 2014 (see also table below under Share-based compensation).  For the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 product developments costs were $2,526,804 and $3,992,349, respectively, a decrease of $1,465,545 or 37%. The decrease is mainly due to the $982,448 reduction in non-cash related expenses and the reduced use of specialist consultants and re-allocation of certain staff to other functions.  The positive impact of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $221,754 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 $430,254. Product Development expenses adjusted for this exchange rate effect decreased for the three months and six months periods by $568,095 and $1,035,292, respectively.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and Marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.  Sales and Marketing expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $336,960 and $664,807, respectively, a decrease of $327,847 or 49%. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $999,120 and $1,228,642, respectively, a decrease of $229,522 or 19%. The decrease was primarily related to $77,781 lower non cash related expenses versus the six month period ended June 30, 2014 (see also table below under Share-based compensation) and less PR and general marketing related expenses.  The positive impact of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $80,848 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 $151,556. Sales and Marketing expenses adjusted for this exchange rate effect decreased for the three months and six months periods by $246,999 and $77,965, respectively  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.  General and Administrative expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $2,664,281 and $3,467,338, respectively, a decrease of $803,057 or 23%. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $5,625,377 and $6,515,286, respectively, a decrease of $889,909 or 14%.  The positive impact of the lower EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $346,158 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 $745,452. General and Administrative expenses adjusted for this exchange rate effect decreased for the three months and six months periods by $456,896 and $144,454, respectively.  The decrease in General and Administrative expenses is primarily the result of the cost reduction measures that started during the second quarter of 2015, including reductions in staff levels and corporate expenses  Share-based compensation  Share-based compensation is comprised of:  � the expensing of the options granted under the 2008 Plan to staff and management;  For the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $752,510 and $ $1,902,537, respectively, a decrease of $1,150,027 or 60%.  For the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $1,584,323 and $ $2,674,261, respectively, a decrease of $1,089,938 or 41%.  During the first six months of 2015 the Company did not grant bonus options for staff. In the first six months of 2014 the granting of bonus options to staff resulted in a share-based compensation expense of $1,053,000. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 the decreased share price over the past year resulted in lower option expensing. A further decrease of approximately $ 230,000 was the result of forfeiture gains due to staff reductions.  In the following tables we show the allocation of share-based compensation according to functions in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss:   Three months ended 2015 2014 restated Variance Cost of service $ 31,016 $ 480,244 $ (449,228 ) Product Development 101,803 878,888 (777,085 ) Sales and Marketing 18,269 89,030 (70,761 ) General and Administrative 601,422 454,375 147,047 Total $ 752,510 $ 1,902,537 $ (1,150,027 ) . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements  As discussed further in Note 35 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our unaudited quarterly financial information (i) for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2013 and (ii) for the first three for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2014 (collectively, the "Restated Periods"). We have restated the revenues and deferred revenues as a result of  The Company has corrected the manner in which it records revenue for its arrangements with multiple-element features, and will also enhance its documentation related to its revenue recognition policies and practices. See "Controls and Procedures" included in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K.  The impact of these errors on the applicable line items in the consolidated financial statements resulting from the restatement is set forth in Note 35 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The net impact of the restatement decreased previously reported revenue of $22,827,261 by $3,375,457 or 15%, to $19,451,804, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013. In the same period of time, the short term portion of deferred revenue increased from $142,731 by 129,036 or 90% to $271,767. The long term portion was increased by $2,364,389. Deferred revenue will be amortized during the lifetime of the customer relationship, which has been defined to be five years. Accounts receivable decreased from $5,976,879 by $882,032 or 15%, to $5,094,847 in the same period in 2013. The restatement increased net loss by approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  Also, the Company has reclassified certain staff costs included in SG&A to Cost of Service, and it disaggregated the function SG&A into Selling and Marketing, General and Administrative and Product Development. The reclassification of operating costs are material to the annual periods ended December 31, 2012, 2013, the interim periods therein, and to the interim periods within fiscal year 2014 and are included in the restatement in Note 35. These expenses have been reclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 to conform to the current period presentation (See Note 35 for the restatement).  As a result of our restatement and in accordance with GAAP, revenue that had originally been recognized in 2013 is now being recognized ratably over an extended timeframe. The amount of revenue earned or to be earned over the entire period of recognition essentially remains unchanged from the amount we historically recognized. There was neither a change to the cash characteristics of the transactions being restated nor the Company's liquidity directly relating to these transactions. As a result of the restatement, the balance sheet reflects a significant increase in deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue over a number of years.  Business overview  As a mobile Software Defined Network Architecture (Software DNA(TM)) vendor Elephant Talk Communications Corp. and its subsidiaries (also referred to as "Elephant Talk", "ET" and "the Company") provide a one stop solution for a full suite of mobile, fixed and convergent telecommunications software services. We also provide layered security services for mission critical applications in the cloud, through our wholly owned subsidiary, ValidSoft UK Limited ("ValidSoft").  Over the last decade, Elephant Talk has developed a comprehensive Mobile Enabling Platform, capable of hosting an integrated IT/BackOffice and Core Network for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), Enablers (MVNEs) and Aggregators (MVNAs) on a fully outsourced basis. Our mobile enabling platform is either made available as an on premise solution or as a fully hosted service in 'the cloud', depending on the individual needs of our MNO and MVNO/MVNE/MVNA partners. Our mobile security services supply telecommunications-based multi-factor mutual authentication, identity and transaction verification solutions for all electronic transaction channels. This integrated suite of security services provides mission critical applications in the cloud to customers in industries such as financial services, government benefits, and insurance, as well as electronic medical record providers and MNOs. Our company provides customers the means to effectively combat a variety of electronic fraud while at the same time protecting consumer privacy.  Company milestone overview  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this document.  Recent milestones for mobile product line:  � On January 29, 2015 we announced the appointment of Dr. Armin G. Hessler (currently Vodafone) and Martin Zuurbier, the current CTO of Elephant Talk, as co-Presidents of our mobile platform business effective on April 1, 2015. Both will report to Mr. Steven van der Velden, Chairman and CEO.  � On January 21, 2015 we announced that LOWI, the Low-Cost Brand of Vodafone has been launched on Elephant Talk's fully redundant mobile platform in Spain, joining virtual operators like Lebara, BT, Eroski, NEO and HITS.  � On December 22, 2014 Affirmed Networks and Elephant Talk Communications Corp. (nyse mkt:ETAK), global leaders in virtualized mobile networks, announced the deployment of Affirmed Networks' Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) solution, called the Affirmed Mobile Content Cloud(TM), as part of Elephant Talk's Software Defined Network Architecture mobile Software DNA(R) 2.0 platform with mobile operators in Europe and the Middle East. Affirmed Networks and Elephant Talk are providing current and future clients with a fully virtualized Evolved Packet Core, encompassing a breadth of capability and services for 3G and 4G core networks.  � On November 21, 2014 we announced that the Company has received official notification from NYSE Regulation, Inc. dated November 20, 2014 that the Company is now in compliance with the listing requirements of Part 10 of the NYSE MKT LLC (the "Exchange") Company Guide (the "Company Guide"). As a result of meeting the Exchange's listing standards, the Company will be removed from the list of noncompliant issuers posted on the Exchange's website.  � On September 25, 2014 we announced that the Company has begun the next phase of its planned SIM migration of Grupo Iusacell ("Iusacell") customers in Mexico. In the meantime developments as described in the subsequent events footnote occurred.  � On August 27, 2014 we announced that independent telecommunications consultancy Ovum (www.ovum.com) in a white paper states, "Elephant Talk Software DNA(R) 2.0, especially with its integration of core network functions, has a more complete solution than the platforms available from the many specialist vendors in the mobile services market."  Recent milestones for the security product line ("ValidSoft"):  � On February 24, 2015 ValidSoft announced that it has launched its Device Trust solution with another major UK retail bank with its partner FICO

                                         This is the second such agreement announced for this solution in the UK and continues building on the successful partnership with FICO. The new client, unnamed for security reasons, is the largest UK deployment of this solution to date for ValidSoft.  � On September 3, 2014, ValidSoft announced that it has been awarded a fourth European Privacy Seal. The fourth seal is for ValidSoft's Zero Latency Correlation process. Zero Latency Correlation enables ValidSoft to securely extract 'Device Trust' data directly from a device application as part of a mobile fraud prevention solution.  � On June 4, 2014, ValidSoft announced that it was featured in a special report, "Speech and Voice Recognition White Paper" published by Biometrics Research Group, Inc., an independent research group. In the report, ValidSoft was identified as one of the global leaders in the field of voice biometrics. According to the report, the voice biometric market has a potential market size of $2.5 billion globally across all market sectors in 2015, driven by the banking and financial sector, it is estimated that the banking and financial sector will spend at least $750 million on voice biometrics by 2015.  � On January 14, 2015, research group Technavio highlighted ValidSoft as one of the 3 leading vendors for voice biometrics, a market that Opus Research predicts to be worth $574 million by 2017.  � On November 2, 2014 ValidSoft expanded its business to Northern America and appointed Shawn Edmunds as Vice-President Northern America.  Results of Operations  Although the vast majority of our cost base is carried out in Euros, we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars ("USD"). The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. The above fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses which are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.  The following table shows the USD equivalent of the major currencies for the year ended December 31, 2014:  USD equivalent  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013  Revenue  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $20,356,447 an increase of $904,643 or 5%, compared to $19,451,804 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The continued and expected market decline of landline based telecommunications caused our legacy landline business to decrease by $3,472,492 or 96%, to $153,759, as of December 31, 2014. This decrease in landline business was off-set by the increase in revenues from our mobile and security solutions business to $20,202,689 in 2014 which increased by $4,377,136 or 28%, compared to $15,825,553 in 2013. The increase in our mobile and security solutions business is mainly due to the migrations of customers onto our mobile platforms resulting in contractual billings to our customers increasing from $22,827,261 in 2013 to $28,560,240 in 2014. In 2014, total billings were $28,560,240 and $20,356,447 was recognized in revenue with the remainder deferred over the remaining contract period in accordance with ASC 605-25. In 2013, the total billings were $22,827,261 and $15,825,553 was recognized in revenue with the remainder deferred over the remaining contract period in accordance with ASC 605-25. For further details see Non-GAAP revenue discussion below.   2014 2013 (restated) Landline Services $ 153,758 $ 3,626,251 Mobile and security solutions 20,202,689 15,825,553 Total Revenue $ 20,356,447 $ 19,451,804  Note 2 (Financial Condition) in this annual report discusses the likely  Non-GAAP Revenue  In order to provide investors additional information regarding our revenue, we include here the discussion of Non-GAAP revenue. As a result of the characteristics of our services, the long-term nature of the contracts and the small customer base, new and substantial sales will remain unnoticed to the investors due to the fact that most of these sales will need to be deferred over a period of 3-5 years. Our non-GAAP financial measure is defined as GAAP revenue adjusted for changes in deferred revenue. We believe this Non-GAAP measure provides useful information regarding our actual billings to our customers during the period which generally reflect the usage rates of our hosted platforms. The presentation of Non-GAAP revenue is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP revenue. The Company therefore adds back to the revenue in the income statement the revenues that were invoiced in the reporting period. At the same time the Company removes from the revenue in the income statement the revenues that have been recognized as a result of sales prior to the reporting period. These two adjustments we refer to as changes in deferred revenue.  A reconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue, for each of the periods indicated, is as follows:  Non-GAAP Revenue 2014 2013 restated Variance Revenues $ 20,356,447 $ 19,451,804 $ 904,643 Deferred Revenue adjustments 8,623,960 2,374,639 6,249,321 $ 28,980,407 $ 21,826,443 $ 7,153,964  Total non-GAAP revenue increased by 32.8%. The phasing out of our landline activities caused our landline non-gaap revenue to be $3.5 million lower than that of the previous year. This was however more than off-set by the $10.6 million increase in the mobile and security solutions business. The vast majority of the revenue increase in our mobile and security solutions business was the result of the customer based SIM (Subscriber Identity Modules) migrations of our customer Iusacell in Mexico. The remainder of the mobile and security growth was only modest in 2014 due to the reduced revenues from non-recurring custom work projects with customers compared to 2013. Following the likely termination of the Iusacell contract and considering the size of Iusacell to our overall revenues, the termination of this contract will have a substantial impact on our revenues. We are currently evaluating the proposal of Iusacell, including assessing the impact on future revenues.  Historic quarterly overview Non-GAAP and GAAP revenue  Non-GAAP revenue Q1 2013 Q2 2013 Q3 2013 Q4 2013 2013 Revenue $ 6,240,114 3,564,249 4,123,794 5,523,647 19,451,804 Changes in deferred revenue 395,121 1,095,390 576,016 308,112 2,374,639 $ 6,635,235 4,659,639 4,699,810 5,831,759 21,826,443 Non-GAAP revenue Q1 2014 Q2 2014 Q3 2014 Q4 2014 2014 Revenue $ 5,384,265 5,072,440 4,445,239 5,454,503 20,356,447 Changes in deferred revenue 809,561 1,727,530 3,217,974 2,868,895 8,623,960 $ 6,193,826 6,799,970 7,663,213 8,323,398 28,980,407  Reclassification of cost and operating expenses  Following the transition from the Company's Landline service to Mobile and Security solution offerings, the Company has evaluated in 2014 the structure of the two line items 'Cost of service' and 'Selling, General and Administrative'. The line item SG&A included all of the Company's staff related cost, including non-cash compensation.  Management concluded that the SG&A function should be categorized by functions of Product Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative and that certain staff costs should be reclassified to Cost of Service. Management believes that these reclassifications of operating costs are material to the annual periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and to the interim periods within fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 2012. Furthermore, management believes that these reclassifications reflect more accurately the nature and financial reporting of the Company. Consequently, staff costs for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 have been reallocated accordingly.  Cost of Service  Cost of service includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization.  Cost of service for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 $6,688,674, a decrease of $2,700,623 or 29%, compared to $9,389,297 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.  Gross margin (excluding depreciation and amortization) as a percent of the total revenue was 67% and 52% for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in our legacy landline service solution, because the costs involved in the mobile and security business are lower compared to the landline business.   2014 2013 (restated) (restated) Revenues $ 20,356,447 $ 19,451,804 Cost of service (excluding depreciation and amortization) 6,688,674 9,389,297 Gross margin (excluding depreciation and amortization) $ 13,667,773 $ 10,062,507  Re-allocation of the Selling, General and Administrative Expenses after the Reclassification  Following the transition from the Company's Landline service to Mobile and Security solution offerings, the Company has evaluated in 2014 the structure of the two line items 'Cost of service' and 'Selling, General and Administrative', and reviewed all staff costs to determine which costs were directly attributable to the generation of revenue, and concluded that certain costs related to product development should be reclassified.  The line item SG&A included all of the Company's staff related cost, including non-cash compensation. It was concluded that the SG&A should be categorized by functions of Product Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative and that certain staff costs were to be reclassified to Cost of Service. It is felt that these reclassifications more accurately reflect the nature and financial reporting of the Company. Consequently, staff costs for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 have been allocated to these new functions and to Cost of Service.  The reclassification of operating costs is material to the annual periods ended December 31, 2012, 2013, the interim periods therein, and to the interim periods within fiscal year 2014.  These expenses have been reclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 to conform to the current period presentation.  Product Development  Product Development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company's services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and ET BOSS &IN platform development and testing are included in this function.  Costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company's operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company capitalized $4,674,199 and $3,505,742, respectively.  Product Development costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $7,228,663 and $6,091,484, respectively, an increase of $1,137,179 or 19%. The increase is due to the expansion of our product development capabilities.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and Marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.  Sales and Marketing expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $2,393,676 and $3,139,015, respectively, a decrease of $745,339 or 24%. The decrease is due to a more focused marketing program approach.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.  General and Administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $12,602,601 and $15,062,640, respectively, a decrease of $2,460,038 or 16%. The decrease is mainly due to share and option granting to management, in comparison to 2013.  Share-based compensation  Share-based compensation is comprised of:  � the expensing of the options granted under the 2008 Plan to staff and management;  For fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $3,888,275 and $8,515,391, respectively, a decrease of $4,627,116 or 54%. The decrease is mainly due to decreased or vesting of share and option to management, in comparison to 2013.  In the following table we show the allocation of share-based compensation according to functions in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss:   2014 2013 Cost of service $ 968,155 $ 930,902 Product Development 1,771,808 1,869,844 Sales and Marketing 179,482 508,678 General and Administrative 968,830 5,205,967 Total $ 3,888,275 $ 8,515,391  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8,220,219, an increase of $1,618,973 or 25%, compared to $6,601,246 for the same period in 2013. The increase is primarily due to the reclassification of projects under construction into live functionalities for our worldwide platform and software capabilities, and the accelerated depreciation of certain assets groups.  Interest Income and Expense  Interest income for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $127,793 and $103,627, respectively. Interest income consists of interest received on bank balances.  Interest expense for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was $1,240,590 and $1,064,999, respectively, an increase of $175,591 or 16%. Higher levels of interest expense were the result of the change of financing sources during 2014. Although we converted an existing note into shares during the month of July 2014 and also converted another existing note into equity for 50% of the principal, the new "Credit Facility' which started November 17, 2014 has a higher principal value than the ones converted and/or repaid. Because the Credit Facility only started November 17, 2014 the three month period ended December 31, 2014 does not reflect a comparable future interest expense. See Notes 14 to 22 for more information. Also during fiscal 2014 we have been able to arrange capital lease financing which causes an increase of our interest expense compared to 2013.  Interest Expense Related to Debt Discount and Conversion Feature  For the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, interest expenses related to debt discount and conversion feature were $3,935,839 and $2,069,649, respectively, an increase of $1,866,190 or 90%.  The increase in the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is due to the change of financing sources during 2014. We converted the affiliate note into equity by issuing additional warrants, which fair value was determined using Black Scholes, and amounted to $482,269. The conversion and early repayment of the non-affiliate note resulted in accelerated debt discount expensing and additional expensing of the exercise price adjustment.  Change in Fair Value of Conversion Feature  The change in the fair value of the conversion feature (related to the 8% Senior Secured Convertible Notes) for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 amounted to $0 and $232,267, respectively. The reason for the decrease is that the conversion feature was extinguished in June 2013 when the 8% Senior Secured Convertible Notes were repaid.  Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities.  The change in the fair value of the remaining outstanding warrants (refer to Note 19) related to a registered direct public offering made by us in June 2013 was a loss of $(114,458) for the twelve months period ended December 31, 2014, compared to a gain of $479,322 for the same period in 2013.  Such changes were primarily due to the decreased value of our stock price, because this is one of the major variables of the valuation. The value of the warrants was determined by a third party valuation expert using a Monte-Carlo Simulation model.  Gain/(Loss) on extinguishment of debt  There is a net gain on extinguishment of debt amounting to $626,108 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $2,631,208 or 131%, . . .
