Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

HFA Partners Introduces FIRM360 Hospital Financial Risk Manager




Helps Healthcare Providers Mitigate Risk, Optimize the 
      Capital Structure, Improve Access to Funding






November 01, 2010 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In a recent survey, one third of healthcare executives reported 
      they were unprepared to deal with risk, and listed cash flow/liquidity 
      as one of the top three risks they face along with health reform and 
      increased competition. Hospitals and healthcare providers are 
      specifically concerned about the growing risks that affect their debt, 
      swaps, investments, ratings, and access to funding.



In response, HFA 
      Partners, LLC, a healthcare financial advisory firm, 
      has introduced FIRM360, 
      a unique analytical tool to help providers identify, quantify, mitigate 
      and monitor the internal and external financial risks embedded in their 
      capital structure.


“The Lehman bankruptcy, the collapse of bond insurers, and the 
      auction rate meltdown have all demonstrated that a hospital’s capital 
      structure can hide significant risks,” noted Pierre 
      Bogacz, a former healthcare investment banker, 
      management consultant and co-founder of HFA Partners. “Until now, the 
      tools weren’t around to identify and measure these risks, so they 
      couldn’t be properly factored into the capital and strategic planning 
      process.”


“FIRM360 is unique in that it combines a sophisticated stochastic 
      risk analysis model with proven enterprise risk management (ERM) 
      methodology already embraced by many hospitals in the patient safety, 
      technology, human capital and regulatory sectors,” added Chris 
      Rea, CFA, co-founder of HFA Partners. “Providers can 
      now identify financial risks, quantify their probability of occurrence 
      and magnitude of impact, define organizational risk appetite, evaluate 
      alternatives to mitigate risk, and put procedures in place to monitor 
      the capital structure on an ongoing basis.”


“FIRM360 enables providers to adjust their capital structure to 
      match their risk appetite and minimize the cost of capital,” said 
      Bogacz. “Everybody wants to control risk and reduce uncertainty, 
      including of course the rating agencies that rate bonds and directly 
      impact the cost of funds. Nobody likes surprises, particularly of the 
      type we’ve experienced in the last couple of years.”


FIRM360 rounds out HFA Partners’ other healthcare 
      financial advisory services, which include transaction 
      structuring, credit rating strategy, and capital market consulting.


HFA clients include Cape Cod Healthcare, a $600 million hospital 
      system, Wellmont Health System, an 8-hospital system, and Physicians 
      Practice Group, the academic faculty practice plan of the Medical 
      College of Georgia.

				Why Hospitals Need an IRMA			

  

By retaining an independent registered municipal advisor, hospitals can qualify under an exception to the SEC MA rule and maintain communications with bankers.
Rule BackgroundMany not-for-profit hospitals depend on ideas from investment bankers to manage and fine-tune their debt structure.  Under the SEC Municipal Advisor Rule adopted in 2014, investment bankers wanting to discuss specific products with hospitals must first qualify under an exception to the Rule. The most flexible exception is when the hospital has retained an Independent Registered Municipal Advisor or "IRMA". 
ExceptionsThere are four exceptions to the MA Rule which may allow a broker-dealer to communicate with a municipal issuer or obligated person:

The hospital has retained an IRMA
The hospital has engaged the firm as underwriter on a specific transaction
The firm is responding to an RFP
The firm is providing general information which is not specific to the hospital.

IRMA ExceptionTo qualify under the IRMA exception, the hospital must retain an IRMA to specifically cover the products and services to be discussed, and the IRMA's involvement must be properly disclosed to bankers. 
HFA PartnersHFA Partners, LLC is an IRMA registered with the SEC and MSRB.  Hiring HFA Partners will qualify for the IRMA exception to the Rule and will ensure that the hospital continues to receive ideas from bankers.
