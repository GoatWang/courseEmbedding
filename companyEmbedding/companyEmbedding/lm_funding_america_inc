How It Works

It works like this: we’re going to make sure you’re not left holding the bag for something that shouldn’t be your responsibility. “We buy problems” means we purchase the right to collect delinquent dues on your behalf, making sure the Association never has to pay another legal bill for collections again. Then we fund an amount equal to or more than your worst-case collection amount immediately so you can operate your business. You can breathe a sigh of relief right now if you want.

 “ You have done a great job recovering full assessments on accounts in bank foreclosure… you have also been successful in obtaining accelerated assessments. Brenda LawGreenacre Properties, Inc. “ Over the past several years when the first contract was signed with LM Funding in reference to the many foreclosed units at Itopia Private Residences the program was extremely beneficial to our community. The community received income through the program and was able to continue maintaining the property. As time went by, LM Funding came up with another program that was even better for our community given that several of the foreclosed units had been purchased. The community has gained immensely from our partnership with LM Funding and we feel very fortunate to continue with you to this day. Rosy C. BadwalItopia “ There are many collection companies around but I have found LM Funding to be a pleasure to work with. LM Funding is unique in the different products they offer to the Associations. There is certainly one to fit everyone’s needs. LM Funding has a diligent, friendly office staff which makes solving issues quick and easy. I like and appreciate the fact that they always strive to make things right on each account and are quick to resolve any issues. Business Law Group (BLG) and LM Funding work closely together and when questions arise from a payout on a unit owner, BLG will answer all questions thoroughly. Together LMF and BLG offer experienced professionalism and great assistance to help Associations with their delinquent homeowner issues Robin SmithCondominium Associates

About










  




OVERVIEW

We started with a simple idea: Other people’s problems shouldn’t be yours.
Formed in January 2008, LM Funding is a financial services company that purchases delinquent accounts from community associations. We offer community associations a variety of financial products customized to an association’s financial needs.
We believe that condo associations and their owners shouldn’t have to take on the financial responsibility of delinquency and the hassle of collection. That’s why we “buy problems.” Before LM Funding, condo association owners would have to hire attorneys to collect bad debt. We’re changing that, with a unique business idea that turns debt into instant cash—freeing condo associations from the burden of collection and allowing them to continue to maintain their operations. LM Funding’s accumulated delinquent assessment balance is now in excess of $150 million. That is a lot of problems that we’ve bought, and we want more!

LM Funding Classic

Typically LM Funding pays the “safe harbor” amount up front and covers all legal fees and costs. LM Funding retains collected interest and late fees and the association receives all recovered assessments. This product typically best suits condos and HOA’s with significant cash flow needs, who want to collect as much of the past due amounts as possible, eliminate legal fees and are less sensitive about the time element of the collection process.









  








http://lmfunding.com/wp-content/themes/salient/css/fonts/svg/basic_elaboration_todolist_plus.svg
New Neighbor GuarantyTM

Once the contract is final LM Funding pays dues for all delinquent accounts on a current basis in exchange for assignment of all of the associations past due accounts receivable. This works best for Condo’s and HOA’s with large delinquent balances and or a high percentage of delinquent units that want to guarantee revenues in their current and future budgets.





  




http://lmfunding.com/wp-content/themes/salient/css/fonts/svg/basic_elaboration_todolist_check.svg
Complete Protection Plan

Generally LM will pay safe harbor amount on all delinquent units, we will cover all legal expenses and fees, and completely eliminate the risk, expense, and time element of collection matters. Upon collection LM recovers its funding amount and legal expenses, the remainder of the proceeds are shared equally with the association.

					Full Description



LM Funding America, Inc., incorporated on April 20, 2015, is a specialty finance company. The Company provides funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida and to nonprofit community associations in the states of Washington and Colorado. The Company also has operations in Illinois. The Company offers incorporated nonprofit community associations, which the Company refers to as Associations, a range of financial products customized to each Association's financial needs. The Company's products include Original Product and New Neighbor Guaranty. Its Original Product offering consists of providing funding to Associations by purchasing their rights under delinquent accounts that are selected by the Associations arising from unpaid Association assessments. The Company provides funding against such delinquent accounts, which the Company refers to as Accounts, in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected by the Associations from the account debtors on the Accounts. It also engages in purchasing Accounts on varying terms tailored to suit each Association's financial needs, including under its New Neighbor Guaranty program. All of its business is conducted through its subsidiary, LM Funding, LLC, and its subsidiaries.Original ProductThe Original Product relies upon Florida statutory provisions that protect the principal amount invested by it in each Account. Under its contracts with Associations for its Original Product, the Company pays Associations an amount up to the Super Lien Amount for the right to receive all collected interest and late fees on Accounts purchased from the Associations. The Company offers its Original Product in Washington, Colorado and Illinois.New Neighbor GuarantyThe Company offers the New Neighbor Guaranty, wherein an Association assigns its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to it in exchange for payments in an amount equal to the regular ongoing monthly or quarterly assessments for delinquent units when those amounts would be due to the Association. The Company assumes both the payment and collection obligations for these assigned Accounts under this product. Once the Company implements the New Neighbor Guaranty program, it begins making scheduled payments to the Association on the Accounts as if the Association had non-delinquent residents occupying the units underlying the Accounts. New Neighbor Guaranty contracts typically allow it to retain all collection proceeds on each Account other than special assessments and accelerated assessment balances.

How It Works

It works like this: we’re going to make sure you’re not left holding the bag for something that shouldn’t be your responsibility. “We buy problems” means we purchase the right to collect delinquent dues on your behalf, making sure the Association never has to pay another legal bill for collections again. Then we fund an amount equal to or more than your worst-case collection amount immediately so you can operate your business. You can breathe a sigh of relief right now if you want.

 “ You have done a great job recovering full assessments on accounts in bank foreclosure… you have also been successful in obtaining accelerated assessments. Brenda LawGreenacre Properties, Inc. “ Over the past several years when the first contract was signed with LM Funding in reference to the many foreclosed units at Itopia Private Residences the program was extremely beneficial to our community. The community received income through the program and was able to continue maintaining the property. As time went by, LM Funding came up with another program that was even better for our community given that several of the foreclosed units had been purchased. The community has gained immensely from our partnership with LM Funding and we feel very fortunate to continue with you to this day. Rosy C. BadwalItopia “ There are many collection companies around but I have found LM Funding to be a pleasure to work with. LM Funding is unique in the different products they offer to the Associations. There is certainly one to fit everyone’s needs. LM Funding has a diligent, friendly office staff which makes solving issues quick and easy. I like and appreciate the fact that they always strive to make things right on each account and are quick to resolve any issues. Business Law Group (BLG) and LM Funding work closely together and when questions arise from a payout on a unit owner, BLG will answer all questions thoroughly. Together LMF and BLG offer experienced professionalism and great assistance to help Associations with their delinquent homeowner issues Robin SmithCondominium Associates
