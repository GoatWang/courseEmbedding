Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Chase (NYSEMKT:CCF) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

GE Launches New Waukesha VGF Gas Engines with Advanced Controls, Giving Operators Greater Flexibility for Mobile and Stationary Applications
October 28, 2015























GE Offers VGF Units with Advanced Controls as Standard Feature for Compact Horsepower Segment, Giving Operators Greater Emissions Reduction and Other CapabilitiesAdvanced Controls Enhance Operator Ability to Reduce Engine Emissions during Gas Compression, Mechanical Drive and On-Site Power for Oil and Gas ProductionNew Units Extend Maintenance Intervals and Lower Operating Expenses 

DALLAS—October 28, 2015—GE’s Distributed Power business (NYSE: GE) today announced the introduction of its new Waukesha* VGF* high-speed gas engine models that, for the first time, combine the company’s proven compact gas engine design with advanced controls normally used in GE’s larger Waukesha units.
Offering advanced controls and aftertreatment capabilities as standard features, the VGF units give operators greater flexibility for on-site power, air/gas compression and drilling applications for oil and gas production compared to other engines available in the 300-600 horsepower high-speed range.
The VGF is adapting the controls and emissions reduction technologies from GE’s larger Waukesha VHP engine, the industry workhorse for gas compression and oilfield power generation. Previously used only for stationary applications before the upgrades, the new F18SE and H24SE VGF models will be available with EPA non-road (mobile) certification for air quality, allowing the units to also be deployed for mobile applications. The certification on the engine also includes coverage for certain stationary applications.
“Our new Waukesha VGF gas engines from GE offer greater flexibility and added value for operators to deploy our engines in difficult applications and high altitudes,” said Wouter-Jan van der Wurff, general manager for gas engines up to 2 megawatts (MW) for GE’s Distributed Power business. 
Until now, engine packagers would buy the engine from GE or another supplier and then the three-way catalyst and air-fuel ratio control systems from other suppliers. But with the introduction of GE’s new Waukesha VGF models with the emPact product offering, GE is offering packagers and end users a more beneficial “one-stop shop“ for the gas engine, controls and aftertreatment systems. 
In addition to the advanced controls, GE’s two new Waukesha VGF models offer improved oil filtration for a healthier engine as well as improved oil cooling capabilities, allowing the unit to operate in even hotter ambient conditions. Additional enhancements include extending the life cycle of the cylinder heads, a new closed crankcase breathing system and a new high-altitude turbocharger coupled with a water-cooled wastegate. These engine improvements also will be offered to operators of existing VGF units in the field.
The new VGF models‘ top-end maintenance intervals have been extended 36 percent, which is a significant upgrade over the existing GSI engine and a 50 percent longer interval than competing engines. The major overhaul interval also is twice as long as offered by other engines. Longer intervals translate into less downtime and higher package availability. Finally, when it comes to servicing the internal components, the VGF is the only engine in its class that offers full access at the job site. The units also will operate for 1,500 hours without an oil, filter and spark plug change, compared to 720 hours required by other engines. This is a key advantage over existing systems because it meets or exceeds EPA NESHAP maintenance guidelines.
The new VGF F18SE and H24SE engines with advanced controls already have been deployed for a half dozen successful U.S. demonstration projects to prove their advantages over existing engines, including projects in stationary gas compression and power generation as well as mobile power generation and air/gas compression. 
The new engines will be commercially available in the first quarter of 2016. The new units were announced during the 2015 High Horsepower (HHP) Summit at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas. For more information, please visit GE’s booth #531.

Hello,I recently purchased a Sony Vaio VGF - AP1L MP3 player (used). Unfortunately, there was no software along with this purchase. I tried using the 'MP3 music manager v2', but to no success. The music manager allows me to copy my mp3s to the player, but subsequently, the player does not play any of these files. It just hangs, and needs a hard reset to recover.Any help would be much appreciated!Thanks,V

The product support page is herehttp://esupport.sony.com/US/p/model-home.pl?mdl=VGFAP1L&template_id=1&region_id=1&tab=manuals#/manua... Looks like it's supposed to support MP3s per the operating instructions. Oh wow, it has a hard drive in it. I wonder if the drive has some bad sectors on it causing it to crash. If the device shows up as a drive on your computer, you can do a scan disk with repair on it (the SLOW one) to look for bad sectors. If you're adventurous, you can try replacing the drive with an SSD. At least that way, you'll not get a hard drive head crash ever again (assuming the device might have suffered from a head crash).

Entrez Gene Summary for VGF Gene




This gene is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of neuroendocrine cells, and is upregulated by nerve growth factor. The structural organization of this gene is similar to that of the rat gene, and both the translated and the untranslated regions show a high degree of sequence similarity to the rat gene. The encoded secretory protein also shares similarities with the secretogranin/chromogranin family, however, its exact function is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]






GeneCards Summary for VGF Gene
             


                                            VGF (VGF Nerve Growth Factor Inducible) is a Protein Coding gene.
                                            Diseases associated with VGF include Pulmonary Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma and Pheochromocytoma.
                                            
                                            GO annotations related to this gene include growth factor activity and neuropeptide hormone activity.
