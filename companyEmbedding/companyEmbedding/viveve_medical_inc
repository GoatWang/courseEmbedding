(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly in Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors."  Overview of Our Business  In the discussion below, when we use the terms "we", "us" and "our", we are referring to Viveve Medical, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Viveve, Inc. and Viveve BV.  We design, develop, manufacture and market a medical device for the non-invasive treatment of vaginal laxity, for improved sexual function, and for vaginal rejuvenation, depending on the relevant country-specific clearance or approval, that we refer to as Geneveve(TM), which includes a radio frequency (RF) generator, which we refer to as the Viveve System, single-use treatment tips and other ancillary disposables. Currently, Geneveve is cleared for marketing in 54 countries throughout the world under the following indications for use:  Indication for Use: No. of Countries: General Surgical procedures for coagulation and hemostasis 2 (including the U.S.) For treatment of vaginal laxity 37 For treatment of the vaginal introitus, after vaginal childbirth, to improve sexual function 14 For vaginal rejuvenation 1  In the U.S., Geneveve is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for coagulation and hemostasis and we market and sell primarily through a direct sales force. Outside the U.S., we market and sell through distribution partners. As of March 31, 2017, we have sold 259 Viveve Systems and approximately 6,300 single-use treatment tips in countries primarily outside of the U.S.  Because the revenues we have earned to date have not been sufficient to support our operations, we have relied on sales of our securities, loans from related parties and bank term loans to fund our operations. We are currently located in Sunnyvale, California. We plan to relocate the corporate headquarters in the second quarter of 2017 as discussed below in "Recent Events."  We are subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the medical device industry. These risks include, but are not limited to, intense competition, whether we can be successful in obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") clearance or approval for the sale of our product and whether there will be a demand for the Geneveve, given that the cost of the procedure will likely not be reimbursed by the government or private health insurers. In addition, we will continue to require substantial funds to support our clinical trials and fund our efforts to expand regulatory clearance or approval for our products in locations in which we do not currently have clearance or approval to market our product, including the U.S. We cannot be certain that any additional required financing will be available when needed or on terms which are favorable to us. As noted above, our operations to date have been primarily funded through the sales of our securities, loans from related parties and bank term loans. Various factors, including our limited operating history with minimal revenues to date and our limited ability to market and sell our product have resulted in limited working capital available to fund our operations. There are no assurances that we will be successful in securing additional financing in the future to fund our operations going forward. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.  Recent Events  On March 22, 2017, in connection with the closing of a public offering (the "March 2017 Offering"), the Company issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of common stock, including the shares issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option, at a public offering price of $4.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $34,500,000. The net proceeds to the Company, after the deduction of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, were approximately $31,503,000.  On February 1, 2017, the Company entered into a sublease agreement (the "Sublease") for approximately 12,400 square feet of building space for the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado (the "Sublease Premises"), which is effective as of January 26, 2017. Physical relocation is planned in the second quarter of 2017 pending completion of the build-out of all office and warehouse facilities.  The term of the Sublease will commence on the later of (i) 120 days after the date sublandlord delivers possession of the Sublease Premises to the Company or  The monthly base rent under the Sublease will be equal to $20.50 per rentable square foot of the Sublease Premises during the first year. The monthly base rent will be equal to $21.12 and 21.75 per rentable square foot during the second and third years, respectively. In connection with the execution of the Sublease, the Company also agreed to pay a security deposit of approximately $22,000. The Company is entitled to an allowance of approximately $88,000 for certain tenant improvements relating to the engineering, design and construction of the Sublease Premises.  Plan of Operation  We intend to increase our sales both internationally and in the United States market by seeking regulatory clearances or approvals for the sale and distribution of our products, identifying and training qualified distributors and expanding the scope of physicians who offer the Geneveve to include plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists and primary care physicians.  In addition, we intend to use the strategic relationships that we have developed with outside contractors and medical experts to improve our products by focusing our research and development efforts on various areas including, but not limited to:  ? designing new treatment tips optimized for both ease-of-use and to reduce procedure times for patients and physicians; and  ? developing new RF consoles, which may include increased security features to prevent piracy, or new cooling systems to maintain compliance with environmental regulations.  The net proceeds received from sales of our securities and the term loans have been used to support commercialization of our product in existing and new markets, for our research and development efforts and for protection of our intellectual property, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We expect that our cash will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next 12 months; however, we will continue to require funds to fully implement our plan of operation. Our operating costs include employee salaries and benefits, compensation paid to consultants, professional fees and expenses, costs associated with our clinical trials, capital costs for research and other equipment, costs associated with research and development activities including travel and administration, legal expenses, sales and marketing costs, general and administrative expenses, and other costs associated with an early stage public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We also expect to incur expenses related to obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals in the U.S. and internationally as well as legal and related expenses to protect our intellectual property. We expect capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future, to be less than $500,000 annually.  We intend to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements through the sales of our products and by raising additional funds from the sale of equity or debt securities. If we sell our equity securities, or securities convertible into equity, to raise capital, our current stockholders will likely be substantially diluted. We may also consider the sale of certain assets, or entering into a strategic transaction, such as a merger, with a business complimentary to ours, although we do not currently have plans for any such transaction. While we have been successful in raising capital to fund our operations since inception, other than as discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any committed sources of financing and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding, or if we do secure additional financing that it will be on terms that are favorable to us. If we cannot obtain financing, then we may be forced to curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives.  Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31 2017 and 2016 Revenue Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands, except percentages)  Revenue $ 3,041 $ 1,284 $ 1,757 137 %  We recorded revenue of $3,041,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to revenue of $1,284,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1,757,000 or approximately 137%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to sales of 42 Viveve Systems, disposable treatment tips and other ancillary consumables in the first quarter of 2017. Sales in the first quarter of 2017 included 29 Viveve Systems sold in the U.S. market through direct sales. Sales in the first quarter of 2016 included 33 Viveve Systems and smaller quantities of disposable treatment tips and other ancillary consumables sold entirely outside the U.S. to our distribution partners.  Gross profit  Three Months Ended   March 31, Change 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands, except percentages)  Gross profit $ 1,422 $ 348 $ 1,074 309 %  Gross profit was $1,422,000, or 47% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31,2017, compared to a gross profit of $348,000, or 27% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1,074,000 or approximately 309%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to sales of 42 Viveve Systems in the first quarter of 2017, which included 29 Viveve Systems sold in the U.S. market through direct sales. Sales in the first quarter of 2016 included 33 Viveve Systems and smaller quantities of disposable treatment tips and other ancillary consumables sold entirely outside the U.S. to our distribution partners.  The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales with higher margin products. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of our product and direct sales versus distributor sales.  Research and development expenses   Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands, except percentages)  Research and development $ 2,388 $ 1,796 $ 592 33 %  Research and development expenses totaled $2,388,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 , compared to research and development expense of $1,796,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $592,000 or approximately 33%. Spending on research and development increased in the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to costs associated with increased engineering and development work with our contract manufacturer related to product improvement efforts. Research and development expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017 also included higher personnel costs for new employees and related additional stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to new employees and additional stock options granted to existing employees for performance bonuses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses   Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands, except percentages)  Selling, general and administrative $ 5,450 $ 2,548 $ 2,902 114 %  Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $5,450,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $2,548,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $2,902,000 or approximately 114%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing efforts to build brand and market awareness, expenses associated with being a public company and financing efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses during 2017 also included higher personnel costs for new employees (primarily in connection with our sales and marketing efforts) and related additional stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to new employees and additional stock options granted to existing employees for performance bonuses.

The increase of $155,000, or approximately 144%, resulted primarily from the additional interest expense for the term loan under the 2016 Loan Agreement, which was computed on a higher loan balance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital. We have funded our operations since inception through the sale of our securities, loans from related parties and bank term loans. To date, we have not generated sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our cash will be sufficient to fund our activities for the next 18 months, however, we will continue to require funds to fully implement our plan of operation.  The following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for the periods presented below (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (8,049 ) $ (2,049 ) Net cash used in investing activities (151 ) (36 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 31,503 (269 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 23,303 $ (2,354 )  Operating Activities  We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in the areas of research and development, regulatory and clinical study costs, associated with the Viveve System.  Operating activities used $8,049,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2,049,000 used for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The primary use of our cash was to fund selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses associated with the Viveve System. Net cash used during the three months ended March 31, 2017 consisted of a net loss of $6,695,000 adjusted for non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of $107,000, stock-based compensation of $372,000, non-cash interest expense of $35,000, and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1,868,000. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $1,929,000, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $174,000 and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $62,000, partially offset by an increase of accounts payable of $273,000. Net cash used during the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted of a net loss of $4,106,000 adjusted for non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of $21,000, stock-based compensation of $188,000, fair value of warrants issued to service providers (primarily related to nonemployee contractors) of $142,000, and non-cash interest expense of $45,000, and cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1,661,000.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $151,000 and $36,000, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was used for the purchase of property and equipment. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, any increase in the number of our employees and any changes to the capital equipment requirements related to our development programs and clinical trials.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $31,503,000, which was the result of the gross proceeds of $34,500,000 from our March 2017 Offering (partially offset by transaction costs of $2,997,000). Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $269,000, which was primarily the result of term loan principal payments of $299,000, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of a warrant and a stock option.  Contractual Payment Obligations We have obligations under a non-cancelable operating lease and a bank term loan. As of March 31, 2017, our contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations: Total 1 Year 1 - 3 Year 3 -5 Years 5 Years Non-cancellable operating lease obligations $ 1,109 $ 537 $ 527 $ 45 $ - Debt obligations (including interest) 11,509 3,676 7,833 - - Total $ 12,618 $ 4,213 $ 8,360 $ 45 $ -  In January 2012, we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory facilities in Sunnyvale, California. The lease agreement, as amended in September 2016, commenced in March 2012 and will terminate in March 2018.  On February 1, 2017, we entered into a Sublease for approximately 12,400 square feet of building space for the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. The lease term is 36 months and the monthly base rent for the first, second and third years is $20.50, $21.12 and $21.75 per rentable square foot, respectively. In connection with the execution of the Sublease, the Company paid a security deposit of approximately $22,000. The Company is also entitled to an allowance of approximately $88,000 for certain tenant improvements relating to the engineering, design and construction of the Sublease Premises.  On June 20, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Loan Agreement, as amended January 13, 2017, with WAB pursuant to which we received a term loan in the amount of $10.0 million. The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the existing outstanding indebtedness with another financial institution and to provide general working capital to fund our operations. As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $10.0 million.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, that was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2017, for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in US GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The ASU provides alternative methods of initial adoption and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB has issued several updates to the standard which i) defer the original effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017 (ASU 2015-14); ii) clarify the application of the principal versus agent guidance (ASU 2016-08); iii) clarify the guidance on inconsequential and perfunctory promises and licensing (ASU 2016-10); and clarify the guidance on certain sections of the guidance providing technical corrections and improvements (ASU 2016-10). In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients", to address certain narrow aspects of the guidance including collectability criterion, collection of sales taxes from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts. This issuance does not change the core principle of the guidance in the initial topic issued in May 2014. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" ("ASU 2015-11"). ASU 2015-11 requires that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this pronouncement at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") or the retail inventory method. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. ASU 2015-11 will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods, with earlier adoption permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". Under this . . .  May 11, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Expert Comments:






  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(7/11/17)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. is off to a strong start, we expect domestic sales to accelerate throughout 2017. . .VIVE hopes to eventually gain FDA clearance of the Viveve System for an indication related to the improvement of sexual function. While we had hoped the pivotal study would begin this year, that timeline may now be pushed to 2018 given that FDA recently asked for additional safety related data. . .there's several reasons why we expect international sales to pick
up throughout 2017 including the agreement with their distributor in
China, requiring that company to purchase at least 75 units this year"
		
		
















Innovative Company Focused on Women's Health Completes Record-Breaking Quarter
				(5/24/17)

			    		Viveve Medical's Q1/17 results beat expectations, an accomplishment that was welcomed by several industry analysts.

      Gregory Chodaczek, B. Riley & Co.
  

(5/12/17)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. reported revenue of $3.04MM, $265,000 higher than we had expected. . .for the quarter, the company sold 42 Viveve Systems, 29 of which were sold in the U.S., and 2,200 disposable treatment tips. . .Viveve announced it had received an expanded indication for the Viveve system in South Korea which now includes for the treatment of vaginal laxity. . .the company has regulatory approvals in 54 countries and expects another 14 regulatory approvals by the end of the year."
		
		












  
      Jeff Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann
  

(5/12/17)

		
		"We reiterate our Buy rating for Viveve Medical Inc. and price target of $22.00 for VIVE. The company has plans for dual pathways into the U.S. marketplace of which the first has been approved. . .the second approach that the company plans to pursue would entail a clinical proven pathway (trial) for approval which would likely be for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function. We believe that the company is currently in discussion with the agency and that a formal IDE would be submitted in the coming months such that a study (VIVEVE II) would commence in late 2017."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(5/12/17)

		
		"We would continue to be buyers of Viveve Medical Inc. following its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by a successful launch of the U.S. commercialization coupled with reaffirmed guidance. For the quarter, 62% of its better-than-expected sales were attributed to the U.S. market, which was commercialized in late January. . .VIVE expanded its South Korean indication to include vaginal laxity and received regulatory approval in Malaysia. . .we believe management's focus on supporting its commercialization efforts in the U.S., obtaining additional regulatory clearances, and investing in market awareness, should provide the foundation for further growth."


		
		









  
      Josh Jennings, Cowen & Co.
  

(5/3/17)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. has immediate access to the burgeoning global market for vaginal rejuvenation. . .it's also within months of starting its VIVEVE II clinical study, which if successful should yield a major commercial advantage in the form of an FDA label to improve female sexual function. We initiate at Outperform, with an $11 price target, representing 4.0 times our 2020 sales forecast."
		
		
















Viveve Medical Posts Record Revenues and Analysts Foresee Continued Growth
				(2/22/17)

      Brian Marckx, Zacks Small-Cap Research
  

(2/21/17)

		
		"For Viveve Medical Inc., Q4/16 marked the sixth straight quarter of sequential double-digit percentage increase in revenue growth. It also set new records in both the number of consoles and treatment tips sold. . .we remain very encouraged that this continues to show a significant ramp."  -Zacks Small-Cap Research

The company announced revenue of $2.45 million and net loss of $5.8 million and $0.55 per share as compared with consensus of $2.14 million and loss of $5.1 million and $0.48 and our estimates for $2.05 million and loss of $5.3 million and $0.49. . .Q4 revenue increased 226% on an annual basis and 32% equentially as the companys commercial and clinical activities continue to drive adoption and penetration in the marketplace."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(2/17/17)

		
		"We would continue to be buyers of Viveve Medical Inc. following its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by increasing system sales, and disposable treatment tip unit sales that increased more than 300% sequentially. . .VIVE is currently awaiting FDA authorization to begin a study for the indication of improving sexual function. Moreover, in January 2017, it announced regulatory clearances in Columbia, Costa Rica, and Malaysia. . .we believe management's focus on attaining additional regulatory clearances, supporting its global distribution partners, expanding its direct sales force, and investing in market awareness, should position it for continued growth."

		
		












  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(1/30/17)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. recently crossed what we characterize as a major milestone with the entry of the Viveve System into the U.S. market and the recent announcement last week that they have begun deployment of their initial domestic sales force. While other energy-based devices targeted to the U.S. vaginal laxity market have preceded Viveve's entry, none are FDA- cleared for an indication related to that use. . .the Viveve System is the only device that has demonstrated significant
efficacy for the improvement in vaginal laxity and/or sexual function."
		
		









  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(11/16/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc.'s randomized clinical study results confirmed earlier findings that Viveve System significantly improves sexual function and reduces vaginal laxity. This marketing study, along with data from previous studies and the recent significantly beefed-up
distribution is expected to help accelerate the roll-out of the Viveve
System. . .Geneveve is now cleared for sale in 49 countries and the company expects to have approval in another two to four by the end of this year."
		
		









  CapitalCube 

(11/14/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. reports financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. . .VIVE's gross margins widened from 28.60% to 37.37% compared to the same period last year, operating (EBITDA) margins now -248.89% from -528.08%."
		
		












  
      Jeff Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann
  

(11/14/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. announced financial results from Q3-2016. . .revenues increased 217% on an annual basis and 19% sequentially as the company's commercial activities continue to gain traction in a variety of worldwide markets with a current base of 162 systems. . .VIVE received 9 regulatory approvals during 2016, which brings
totals to 34 countries, and ongoing efforts in 16 more countries of which at least two more are expected by the end of the year. . .VIVE has plans for dual pathways into the U.S. marketplace of which the first has been approved."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(11/11/16)

		
		"3Q16 marked Viveve Medical Inc.'s second quarter of commercial sales in China, and the APAC region continues to exhibit the most strength, followed by the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America, comprising roughly 65%, 25%, 6%, and 4% of sales. . .VIVE received an FDA 510(k) clearance in the U.S., and it has begun commercialization. . .we view the company's recent regulatory clearances as significant milestones (i.e. S. Korea, Brazil, and the U.S.), as approval in these countries represents large market opportunities. . . we believe management's focus should position it for growth."
		
		












  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(10/13/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. continues to make substantive progress towards their quest to commercialize the Viveve System in the U.S.  In late September the company submitted an IDE to FDA seeking approval to commence VIVEVE II, a pivotal U.S.-based study expected to support an eventual regulatory filing seeking clearance for an indication related to improvement in sexual function. . .so assuming FDA concurs with a proposed FSFI endpoint and eventual FDA clearance for the treatment. . .in our opinion, could be a game-changer for Viveve."
		
		












  
      Jeff Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann
  

(10/7/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. announced that the Viveve System has received 510(k) regulatory clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). . .we had previously expected the clearance to occur during Q4 and towards the end of the calendar year; thus, the slightly earlier-than-expected clearance could bolster Q4 and 2017 revenues beyond our current estimates. . .the company has plans for dual pathways into the U.S. marketplace. Currently Viveve is in discussion with the FDA for a 510(k) clearance."
		
		












The  Life Sciences Report Interview with Anthony Vendetti 

(10/5/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. recently announced that it submitted its investigational device exemption for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under de novo 510(k) to begin a study, which will involve about 250 patients. . .we believe this double-blind, randomized trial has the potential to get FDA approval for something that other companies with devices for vaginal rejuvenation don't have. So we believe that if this 250-patient trial is successful, Viveve could have FDA approval for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function in women. That could be a very powerful approval, if Viveve is able to get it. We're estimating in 2018 that Viveve could be the first company to have that approval, which would open up a huge market for Viveve, in our opinion. . .Viveve has the technology. It's putting together a worldwide distribution network. And it has the management team to execute, which is a significant part of any equation of a company that is at the stage of Viveve."

      Jeff Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann
  

(9/20/16)

		
		"The Viveve Medical Inc. treatment is a non-invasive solution for vaginal laxity that is performed in less than 30 minutes in a physicians office, and does not require the use of anesthesia. . .the company has been able to demonstrate successful clinical study results in multiple trials. To date, three human studies have been performed with extremely encouraging results. . .within one month after the Viveve treatment, patients reported a statistically significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores as compared to pre-childbirth levels. . .the system also demonstrated a strong safety profile throughout the study."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(8/12/16)

		
		"We would continue to be buyers of Viveve Medical Inc. following its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by the continued commercialization of the Viveve System in new international markets. . .we view the company's recent regulatory clearances as incrementally positive (i.e. South Korea, Singapore), as approval in these countries represents another large market opportunity in Asia. . .to account for the 2Q16 results, as well as our expectations, we are raising our 2016, 2017, and 2018 revenue estimates to $6.4M, $12.8M, and $21.7M, from $6.0M, $12.3M, and $20.9M, respectively.
		
		









  
      Charles Haff, Craig-Hallum Capital
  

(8/8/16)

		
		"We expect Viveve Medical Inc. to launch in the U.S. with a 'general' product label in early 2017 but they are also  pursuing an expanded label which would allow them to market and sell  their product for 'vaginal laxity' or sexual dysfunction. . .given the enormous size of the market opportunity, the elegance of VIVE's solution, and a strong management team that we believe can execute on the opportunity, we see the stock reaching $16 based on the 'general' product label in the U.S. and only 2% penetration of target markets."
		
		












  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(6/22/16)

		
		"VIVEVE Medical Inc.'s randomized clinical study results confirmed earlier findings that Viveve System significantly improves sexual function and reduces vaginal laxity. This marketing study, along with data from previous studies and the recent significantly beefed-up distribution is expected to help accelerate the roll-out of the Viveve System. . .distribution agreement in Brazil, which leads the world in cosmetic surgery, just consummated and could be a particularly strong catalyst in 2016. Next steps are to conduct U.S. study in support of FDA filing study could initiate this year."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(6/21/16)

		
		"We would continue to be buyers of Viveve Medical Inc. after a better-than-expected quarter. . .the revenue growth was driven by better than-expected placements of Viveve Systems and sales of disposable treatment tips around the world. . .the company released positive results for VIVEVE I clinical trial, which further ensures efficacy of the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal introital lexity. . .VIVE may be the first company with an FDA-approved device for the treatment of vaginal tissue . . .VIVE is well-positioned to gain regulatory clearances in additional countries, which should lead to the Viveve System gaining further traction."
		
		












  
      Brian Marckx, Zacks Equity Research
  

(6/15/16)

		
		"In mid-May Viveve Medical Inc. reported financial results for the first quarter ending March 31. Revenue. . .was just a hair shy of $1.3M. This represents sequential growth of 71% and 34x the $38k booked in Q1 of last year. VIVE recognized sales of 33 systems and approximately 480 treatment tips in the most recent quarter. As of the Q1. . .the systems installed base stood at approximately 76 units - which implies the recent placement rate of ~10 units per month is continuing to hold."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(4/27/16)

		
		"The positive results of VIVEVE I clinical trial builds upon the two previous clinical studies conducted in the U.S. and Japan to further validate the safety and efficacy of its system for the treatment of vaginal laxity. . .approximately 80% of the active subjects showed a positive change in VSQ score at 6 months. Based on mean VSQ score over time, patients improved significantly, and were able to sustain improvement after a single treatment."
		
		









  
      Gregory Chodaczek, Sterne Agee
  

(4/22/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. announced positive topline results from its VIveve Treatment of the Vaginal Introitus to EValuate Efficacy (VIVEVE I) clinical study. Based on positive interim results announced in July 2015 of 62 participants, we are not surprised by yesterday's strong results. . .this randomized, single-blinded, sham controlled trial consisted of 155 patients from nine clinical sites in Europe, Canada and Japan, with 103 receiving the active treatment and 52 receiving the sham treatment. Six months after treatment. . .the proportion of patients reporting no vaginal laxity in the active group was 41.7% vs. the sham group of 19.2%."
		
		












  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(3/9/16)

		
		"Given that Viveve Medical Inc.'s MonaLisa Touch continues to be a critical driver of top-line growth, the company plans on expanding
its salesforce to 16-20 representatives, from 13, over the next 12 months to bolster distribution efforts. . .the company's entry into women's intimate wellness, Intima builds upon ELOS' CO2RE platform to perform gynecological and genitourinary treatments. . .the recently announced CO2RE Intima laser system should enable ELOS to penetrate the large and growing vaginal rejuvenation market; which, according to VIVE presents a total near-term global market opportunity of $7B over the next four years."

		
		









  
      Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group
  

(1/27/16)

		
		"We are initiating coverage of Viveve Medical Inc., an emerging player in the non-invasive vaginal rejuvenation market. . .with a network spanning 50 countries worldwide, and regulatory approval in 22 of those countries, Viveve has a strong distribution platform that should incrementally drive system placements until expected FDA approval is attained in 1H18E. We opine that, over the next few years, additional clearances should propel growth and catalyze the company's penetration of the fast-growing, multi-billion dollar vaginal rejuvenation market."
		
		









  
      Gregory Chodaczek, Sterne Agee
  

(1/8/16)

		
		"Viveve Medical Inc. pre-announced top-line financial results for 4Q/15 of $750K, including revenue from the sale of 21 Viveve System and 216 treatment tips. Over the quarter Viveve doubled its total installed base, bringing the total OUS commerical installed base to 42 Systems. . .while the market for the treatment of vaginal introitus is relatively new, we think the market is large and the uptake and usage of the Viveve System could be quicker than expected."

Viveve is Passionate About Women’s Health and Wellness.
 


Adoption of elective medical procedures is increasing dramatically worldwide.  Women are largely driving this trend, which is creating an emerging demand for nonsurgical gynecologic treatments. Despite the growing demand, there is a surprisingly limited number of safe and effective technologies specifically designed for female conditions.  Now, there is a company that is helping women’s health and wellness come into its own – Viveve.  
What sets us apart?
 
Internationally Patented Technology
Our passion drives innovation! We are proud to develop platform technologies that improve women’s health and overall well-being, while adhering to the highest scientific and ethical standards. Sustained tissue tightening and strengthening requires substantial heating at the appropriate depth in tissue. Only the Viveve® System utilizes cryogen-cooled monopolar radiofrequency (CMRF) to uniformly deliver gentle volumetric heating while cooling delicate surface tissue. Because of our unique technology, robust neocollagenesis is stimulated by one 30-minute in-office Geneveve by Viveve session.
 
Robust Clinical Science
The Geneveve treatment has been tested in three prospective clinical trials: one in the U.S., one in Japan and a large, multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled multi-national clinical trial. The goal of assessing the safety, effectiveness and meaningful benefit of the treatment was successfully achieved. In all trials, statistically significant and sustained results were found.


Viveve External Research Program
Viveve’s External Research Program (ERP) supports a global network of investigator-initiated research focusing on the cultivation of elective procedures and leading-edge medical device technologies. The program fosters investigative research with the goal of improving the quality of patient care and clinical outcomes.
