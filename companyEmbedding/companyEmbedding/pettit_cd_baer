When deciding what paint brands to carry, Wholesale Marine could not help but take note of how Pettit products have outperformed all other major brands of antifouling bottom paints, topside paints and varnishes.
Create vivid color schemes, save time and the ecosystem with the long lasting Pettit Marine Paint.
Wholesale Marine makes it easy for you to find the right paint with our bottom paint guide. We carry Pettit paint which manufactures everything a boater needs to keep their boat looking great for years to come. Hydrocoat is Pettit’s ‘pride and joy’, as it offers multi season protection with minimal clean and odor. Pettit’s Hydrocoat combines high-speed performance, durability, and environmental responsiveness. This Ablative Antifouling Marine Paint product uses water to effectively transfer the paint to your boat. Hydrocoat is formulated with a 40% cuprous oxide and is tough enough to withstand frequent trailering, launching and beaching.
The Pettit Ultima series offers the ultimate in marine coating protection. The Ultima s60 and s40 paint delivers slime resistance, build up reduction, and uses the highest ablative copper load (60%). Ultima Eco is the perfect choice for power and sailboats. When compared to its competition, Ultima Eco contains 50% more of the powerful slime fighting agent, the organic Econea biocide. Ultima Eco is safe to use on all substrates, including aluminum and provides excellent antifouling protection. Ultima Eco’s surface wears away over time, eliminating paint film build up and the need for sanding. It can be used on almost all previously painted surfaces in good condition.
Wholesale Marine carries the EZ series, designed with your bilge, deck, and cabin areas in mind. EZ Bilge is a durable high-performance alkyd finish specially formulated to withstand the abuses associated with boat bilges. The tough surface is long lasting and resistant to antifreeze, grease, gasoline, diesel fuel, and engine oil. Slip resistant, easy to apply, and durable- Pettit’s EZ-Decks is the ultimate in polyurethane non-skid finishes. It contains produces a slip-resistant finish and contains ultraviolet fibers ensuring vivid and vibrant colors that will hold up for years. EZ Cabin-Coat provides a moisture resistant, mildew proof finish that will stay vibrant, vivid, and peel free for years. Perfect for high humidity areas such as cabin interiors, heads, lockers, cabinets, drawers and closets, it can be used on all interior surfaces, such as drywall, wood, fiberglass, wood coverings and even tile.

Antifouling Boat Bottom Paint
Marine organisms such as slime, weeds, and barnacles can affect your boat’s performance and durability. Antifouling Boat Bottom Paints from Wholesale Marine feature antifouling for racing sailboats and powerboats, multi season protection, and protection for every watercraft. Wholesale Marine only carries boat bottom paint products tough enough to withstand frequent trailering, launching and beaching. Paint specifically formulated for below the underside falls into two categories- hard bottom or ablative. How do you know if you need a Hard Bottom or Ablative Bottom Paint? Below we’ll give you the details.
Hard Boat Bottom Paints have a higher concentration of biocides, and form a tough coating that does not wear away. Hard Bottom Paints are generally recommended for boats that are faster and kept in the water year ‘round. Pettit offers a great choice in their Trinidad Hard Antifouling Marine Paint which has excellent adhesion, and is highly abrasion resistant for long wear. Ablative Bottom Paints have layers that slowly wear away over time, to reveal fresh biocides, reduce oxidation, yet due to its limited life, Ablative Bottom Paints are recommended only for boats stored out of the water.
Interlux Antifouling Bottom Paints reduce friction, improve fuel efficiency, and are ideal for use in fresh and low-fouling salt water. Interlux uses metallic copper to provide complete protection in freshwater or low-fouling saltwater. We recommend Interlux Micron CSC Antifouling Bottom paint with an Interlux exclusive, Micron technology, to provide excellent, long-lasting antifouling protection by using less copper more efficiently than traditional high-copper bottom paints.
Wholesale Marine Carries Only the Best Boat Bottom Paint Brands!
Pettit Paints combine high-speed performance and durability with environmental responsibility. Racing and recreational finishes are easy to apply and quick to launch. Pettit Paints offers durable multi-season protection with quick clean-up and little to no odor.
Aquagard Antifouling Bottom Paints are available in convenient spray as well as in gallon cans. We recommend using Aquaguard Inflatable Antifouling Bottom Paint to extend the life of your inflatable craft. Their Marine grade anti-foulant paints are intended for use in both fresh and saltwater, provide barriers to inhibit the growth of algae, are water based, and some even aid in improving depth sounder and fish finder performance.
Wholesale Marine carries a full inventory of boat bottom paints for every kind of watercraft. If you are not certain which paint is right for your boat, give us a call at: (877) 388-2628. Our knowledgeable staff will be glad to assist you. We’re here Monday through Friday, from 9:00 AM until 6:00 PM and look forward to speaking with you!

Ablative
Ablative Bottom Paints have layers that slowly wear down over time, revealing fresh biocides which reduce oxidation. Due to their limited life, ablative bottom paints are recommended for boats that are stored out of water at any point in the year. Ablative Bottom Paints are available in single and multi-season formulas, and can be applied over almost any other paint.
Hard
Higher concentration of biocides and tough coating that does not wear away. Hard Bottom Paints are recommended for boats that are kept in the water.
Copper Free
Developed to reduce the amount of copper toxicity in water, Copper Free Bottom Paints utilize a metal-free biocide called Econea. Copper Free Bottom paints are typically easier to apply and clean up and are a great option for boaters living in areas with copper restrictions.
Thin Film
Ideal for racing sailboats and powerboats, Thin Film Bottom Paints give a thin, smooth racing finish. Thin Film Paints dry quickly, allowing for fast re-launch. 
Waterbased
Waterbased Bottom Paints work as effectively or better than conventional antifouling paints, but are easier to clean up and don't leave a smelly odor. Waterbased Bottom Paints are east to apply and very little solvent gets into the air.
