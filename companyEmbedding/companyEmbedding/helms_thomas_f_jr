Mr. Helms served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Culbro Corporation's smokeless tobacco division from 1983 until shortly before its sale to American Maize-Products Company in 1986. From 1979 to 1982, Mr. Helms was General Manager of the Etherea Cosmetics and Designer Fragrances Division of Revlon, Inc. From 1964 to 1979, Mr. Helms was employed in marketing and sales positions in various divisions of Revlon, Inc.   We believe Mr. Helms is well-qualified to serve as a director due to his many years of experience in the tobacco industry, and in particular with our company, as well as his role in forming our predecessor. This experience provides him with a deep knowledge of both our industry and our company, which provides valuable insight to our Board.
