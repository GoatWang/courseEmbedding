Our solutions are facilitating cheaper and cleaner solar power
OUR CORE VALUES





 
 
  
 
 
 





Imagine a world where humankind’s current and future energy needs can be fully sourced from the Sun?
The annual energy from the Sun shining on Earth is more than the estimated World’s fossil fuel reserves. Electricity generated from Solar is becoming more affordable and will become price competitive as compared to retail electricity from fossil fuels. Grid parity is being achieved increasingly across sun belt regions of the world.
This trend has been supported by significant reduction in component costs of solar systems including solar panels in about the last decade. Coupled with expected increase in worldwide electricity prices from traditional sources, solar electricity will become a significant source of meeting the world’s future electricity consumption. (Note: In 2015 the estimated contribution of solar electricity to the world’s total electricity supply of 6,000GW can be roughly rounded up to 1%).
Solar provides power at the times it is needed and combined with storage will be able to provide the majority of electricity needs in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner.

LONDON, May  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VivoPower International PLC, a global next generation solar power company, today announced an Alliance Agreement with ReNu Energy (ASX:RNE) of Australia, pursuant to which ReNu Energy will have a right of first offer to acquire solar projects originated by VivoPower in Australia below 5MW in size.  In addition, VivoPower has entered into a term sheet with ReNu Energy for the transfer and operation of the first of these, the 600kW Amaroo Solar PV Project, subject to customary conditions precedent.
Under the terms of the agreement, Renu Energy will pay an annual alliance fee for the initial five year term of the agreement calculated based on the number of projects acquired from VivoPower, which may be extended by VivoPower for an additional five years. For each project acquired, ReNu Energy will also pay an up-front origination fee to VivoPower, and will enter into a long-term agreement under which VivoPower will provide asset management services.
"We are very pleased to partner with ReNu Energy and we hope that the sale of Amaroo is the first of many projects that we will transfer pursuant to the Alliance Agreement," said Dr. Philip Comberg, Chief Executive Officer of VivoPower International PLC. "For VivoPower, the Alliance Agreement provides a unique strategic pathway to strengthen our build, transfer and operate (BTO) model for commercial, industrial and government (CIG) solar PV projects in Australia and to grow our base of long term recurring power services revenue."
CEO & Managing Director of RNE, Mr Chris Murray commented, "We are delighted to be partnering with VivoPower, a successful originator of solar PV projects across the globe. The Alliance Agreement will allow us to accelerate the growth of our portfolio of behind the meter renewable energy assets."
"The Amaroo Solar PV asset marks ReNu Energy's first operational solar asset in what we aim to grow into a portfolio of solar PV projects. The Amaroo Project is operational and has a long term government offtake - an ideal project with which to launch our solar PV business and an example of future projects which we will seek to develop in conjunction with our partner, VivoPower. Amaroo will deliver an average annual contracted 20 year cash yield of 12.7% per annum, delivering positive cashflow to ReNu Energy."

About Usvivopower2017-03-08T13:24:26+00:00 
VivoPower is an international solar power company
Our purpose is to enable solar power globally, grow our people and build long term shareholder value.
Contact Us


WHO WE ARE
VivoPower International PLC’s business model is to operate solar power assets to provide our commercial, industrial and government customers with renewable energy.
VivoPower’s business model encompasses the following:

VivoPower’s team is an uncommon combination of power plant development and utility industry experience, financial & investment expertise and technology literacy. Collectively the team has financed, structured, developed, commissioned, operated and/or optimised in excess of 1GW of power assets, including over 500MW of solar power plants around the world. This unique and holistic team composition allows VivoPower to add value throughout the entire lifecycle from sourcing opportunities, arranging finance, design, installation, power support services (encompassing asset operation, maintenance, data analytics and optimisation) and commissioning.
The energy industry is rapidly changing
Our solutions are facilitating cheaper and cleaner solar power
OUR CORE VALUES





 
 
  
 
 
 





Imagine a world where humankind’s current and future energy needs can be fully sourced from the Sun?
The annual energy from the Sun shining on Earth is more than the estimated World’s fossil fuel reserves. Electricity generated from Solar is becoming more affordable and will become price competitive as compared to retail electricity from fossil fuels. Grid parity is being achieved increasingly across sun belt regions of the world.
This trend has been supported by significant reduction in component costs of solar systems including solar panels in about the last decade. Coupled with expected increase in worldwide electricity prices from traditional sources, solar electricity will become a significant source of meeting the world’s future electricity consumption. (Note: In 2015 the estimated contribution of solar electricity to the world’s total electricity supply of 6,000GW can be roughly rounded up to 1%).
Solar provides power at the times it is needed and combined with storage will be able to provide the majority of electricity needs in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner.

CHEAPER & GREENER 
		







SOLAR FOR BUSINESS 
		

Reduce Costs & Carbon Emissions 
		


 



Enabling Rooftop Commercial, Industrial & Government (CIG) Solar
VivoPower works with CIG developers and customers such as schools, shopping centres, retailers, airports, wineries, breweries, industrial parks, data centres, shipping ports and manufacturers to enable and manage solar power consumption.
Pre Commissioning Phase
VivoPower’s team has a deep and holistic understanding of the challenges faced by CIG solar project developers including grid / interconnect agreements (where appropriate), managing deadlines and project timetables, negotiating procurement terms and delivery schedules with equipment and EPC suppliers and financing roadblocks (encompassing tax equity, construction finance, project finance / back leverage finance as well as equity). Our team has successfully helped CIG solar developers overcome such challenges and realise their objective of commissioning rooftop solar plants and crystallising development profits in the process.
Post Commissioning Phase
VivoPower provides power support services (encompassing operations, maintenance, data analytics and optimisation), storage and energy efficiency solutions, smart power services as well as technology to its power customers.
 The energy industry is rapidly changing
Our solutions are facilitating cheaper, green solar power for business
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Commercial, Industrial and Government (CIG) customers exploring a rooftop solar solution typically seek answers to the following questions:
Reliability – Will the system be as reliable as the current electricity supply?
Yes – the solar power supplied by the panels will supplement the electricity supply from the grid. In the event of a technical fault or outage, your supply would automatically resume from the grid.
Equipment – What equipment do you use?
At VivoPower we place reliability and safety of power provision to customers as of the utmost importance. We provide power and we take away the hassle of clients having to follow the latest in solar panel or inverter technology. It is seamless to our clients and you only need to worry about your core business.
Aesthetics / Space Required – Will the panels impact the aesthetics of the building?
The panels will only be visible if you are viewing the roof space.
Panels are non-intrusive and are prevalent throughout the world.
Inverters are the only other visible pieces of equipment and are small and will be installed in areas of low impact (in consultation with the customer).
Safety – Is the system safe both when being installed and in operation?
Yes – we commission approved installers to install the system according to all relevant Standards and have the utmost focus on safety.
The operating system is safe and will not impact day to day operations. Should the equipment fail, power will immediately be sourced from the grid with no interruption to supply. This changeover happens safely and automatically without intervention.
Business Interruption – Will the installation or operation interrupt our business?
Standard solar installations typically involve minimal if any business interruption. The majority of work occurs outside the premises and the actual period of time that power is interrupted is much shorter than the total installation time – usually the interruption is only required to connect the new equipment to the existing equipment. We will liaise with you through the installation process and work with you on scheduling any potential power outage.
VivoPower will be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the system for the life of the contract.
Contract Period – What is the length of the typical contract?
As we are installing long life assets and there is no upfront capital required by you for those assets, we do need to have a longer-term agreement. We need to fit this to a business case depending on your tariffs and how long you or your landlord intends to be at site. We will discuss this with you in the early stages of engagement to ensure there is a strong business fit between us as we will be your partner and supplier through a long-term agreement.
Estimated Savings – What level of cost savings and carbon savings can be expected?
The exact level of savings depends on the particular project. However with a PPA (power purchase agreement), there will be no upfront capex and there will normally be material ongoing power cost savings. The carbon savings on each unit of energy consumed will be 100% (solar is emission free).
How do we get started?
We will meet with you and request current energy usage data. From analysis of that data, we will be able to put together a package that suits your needs and will give you an indication of contract length and next steps.
Enjoy  cheaper, easier and greener power  than you do today through the use of solar technologies!
Beat the price increases with a discounted rate for your energy needs.

Canadian Solar is our global preferred supplier.




 
 
  
 
 
 





Imagine a world where humankind’s current and future energy needs can be fully sourced from the Sun?
The annual energy from the Sun shining on Earth is more than the estimated World’s fossil fuel reserves. Electricity generated from Solar is becoming more affordable and will become price competitive as compared to retail electricity from fossil fuels. Grid parity is being achieved increasingly across sun belt regions of the world.
This trend has been supported by significant reduction in component costs of solar systems including solar panels in about the last decade. Coupled with expected increase in worldwide electricity prices from traditional sources, solar electricity will become a significant source of meeting the world’s future electricity consumption. (Note: In 2015 the estimated contribution of solar electricity to the world’s total electricity supply of 6,000GW can be roughly rounded up to 1%).
Solar provides power at the times it is needed and combined with storage will be able to provide the majority of electricity needs in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner.

Imagine a world where humankind’s current and future energy needs can be fully sourced from the Sun?
The annual energy from the Sun shining on Earth is more than the estimated World’s fossil fuel reserves. Electricity generated from Solar is becoming more affordable and will become price competitive as compared to retail electricity from fossil fuels. Grid parity is being achieved increasingly across sun belt regions of the world.
This trend has been supported by significant reduction in component costs of solar systems including solar panels in about the last decade. Coupled with expected increase in worldwide electricity prices from traditional sources, solar electricity will become a significant source of meeting the world’s future electricity consumption. (Note: In 2015 the estimated contribution of solar electricity to the world’s total electricity supply of 6,000GW can be roughly rounded up to 1%).
Solar provides power at the times it is needed and combined with storage will be able to provide the majority of electricity needs in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner.

Enabling Groundmount Utility Scale Solar
VivoPower works with Utility developers and long term asset owners to enable and manage solar power consumption
Pre Commissioning Phase
VivoPower’s team has a deep and holistic understanding of the challenges faced by Utility Scale solar project developers including negotiating and securing PPAs and grid / interconnect agreements, managing COD deadlines and project timetables, negotiating procurement terms and delivery schedules with equipment and EPC suppliers and financing roadblocks (encompassing tax equity, construction finance, project finance / back leverage finance as well as equity). Our team has successfully helped developers overcome such challenges and realise their objective of commissioning ground mount utility scale solar plants and crystallising development profits in the process.
Post Commissioning Phase
VivoPower provides power support services (encompassing operations, maintenance, data analytics and optimisation), storage and energy efficiency solutions, smart power services as well as technology to its power customers.
