CONSUMER ALERT




SOME DATA MAY BE OUT-OF-DATE
TaxBuzz uses basic business information from third-party data providers. We have built our database from these public records and sources. In the process, some of the data may appear out-of-date. We allow business owners to claim their listings to make sure we are showing the most accurate profiles and contact information.
This profile has been flagged as possibly being out-of-date, and it may mean the professional is no longer practicing or has not renewed their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) with the IRS which is required to prepare and sign tax returns. If this is your business, feel free to claim this listing and update your profile information to bring the profile to live status.










IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant




This individual is a participant in the IRS's voluntary tax preparer program, which generally includes the passage of an annual testing requirement (1) and the completion of a significant number of hours of continuing education. Preparers satisfying these educational requirements and agreeing to abide by the IRS's rules are allowed to represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only before revenue agents, customer service representatives, and similar IRS employees, including the Taxpayer Advocate Service. This extremely important privilege is not extended to tax preparers who are not attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. To be eligible, tax preparers must complete the AFSP requirement every tax year.
(1) In states that have their own program; the annual testing requirement is waived.
