Newton

ACTIVE MANAGER OF EQUITY, BOND, MULTI-ASSET, REAL RETURN AND INCOME SOLUTIONS, UNDERPINNED BY A DISTINCTIVE GLOBAL THEMATIC FRAMEWORK

VIEW BOUTIQUE SITE

























1978


ESTABLISHED 

London


HEADQUARTERS









OVERVIEW
Based in London, Newton is known for its distinctive, global thematic approach, which is applied consistently across all strategies- equity, fixed income and multi-asset. It provides investment products and services to a wide range of clients, including pension plans, endowments, corporations and (via BNY Mellon) individuals.
Its approach aims to identify themes and trends that are influencing, or are likely to influence, economies and markets across the globe. It combines the perspective afforded by themes with fundamental analysis and the skills of active investment management to seek to identify global winners.



Investment Philosophy
Newton is focused on delivering innovative investment solutions to meet its clients' real-world challenges. It has a robust investment approach which combines rigorous fundamental analysis with the broad perspective of its global investment themes. Its themes help identify long-term focuses of change across global markets and industries, helping to identify opportunities and risks, and shielding out short-term market 'noise'. Newton firmly believes the best companies to invest in are those that are responsibly managed and assesses environmental, social and governance factors as a core part of its investment analysis.



Team
Newton has a flat organizational structure, with portfolio managers and global research analysts working together in a single location, enabling the entire investment team to collaborate in idea generation and implementation. At Newton, analysis is a career path, not a stepping stone; many of the firm's experienced analysts have worked directly in the sectors for which they are responsible.

Portfolio composition and allocation is as of 06/30/17 and is subject to change at any time. Totals may not be exact due to rounding. Negative exposures may represent short positions through derivatives.The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security. Large concentrations can increase share price volatility.Source: Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The MSCI EAFE Index (Europe, Australasia, Far East) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets, excluding the U.S. and Canada.Price/earnings for a stock is the ratio of the company's most recent month-end share price to the company's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the current fiscal year. If a third-party estimate for the current year EPS is not available, Morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported EPS and average historical earnings growth rates. Price/ earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the Morningstar Style Box. For portfolios, this historical P/E data point is calculated by taking an asset-weighted average of the earnings yields (E/P) of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result. Source: MorningstarReflects the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark. An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark. In order to compare funds across general asset classes, Morningstar calculates R-squared values relative to a "standard" broad-based market index. For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index. Thus, the "standard" broad-based market index used by Morningstar may differ from the fund's actual benchmark stated in this factsheet. Source: MorningstarBeta is a measure of the systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio and is an indicator of expected return. A beta higher than 1.0 has higher risk than the overall market has and thus the stock or portfolio can be expected to perform in relation to the overall market in that way.A statistical measurement of dispersion around an average which depicts how widely fund returns varied over a certain period of time.
