﻿

      I am an American, first (birth).  I am a Mormon, second (baptized at 8). 
      I have always been a child of God (all humans on earth).
 
Early Years
        Born in Price, Utah in 1950, Steve Davis grew up in Tucson, Arizona where his father was Institute Director at the University of Arizona between 1954-1966.  He is a 5th generation descendant of Parley P. Pratt.

“My father, Dr. H. Clyde Davis, was hired by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 as Chief Geologist, Atomic Energy Commission and very important to the US government for gathering additional wealth to rule the nation (federal mining claims were under the total control of my dad).  He had eight airplanes in Salt Lake City to map out the whole US.  For eight years under Eisenhower Clyde Davis did all the covert mining and interstate freeway mapping.  
        
Clyde was so successful through his professional expertise he was honored in 1954 through a meeting with five great leaders: US Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, former President Harry S. Truman, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley and Mormon President David O. McKay through his services since World War II in keeping America safe.  After this meeting the family moved to Tucson, Arizona where his father commenced 
        staking various mining claims on US Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service lands for patenting and conversion into private property for the recovery of the precious metals.  “At this time I was only four years old.  Throughout my life I traveled with my father assisting him in the evaluation, testing and staking of mining claims on various federal, state and private lands, mostly in the Western and Central United States (west of the Mississippi).”
        
My personal knowledge of “angels” began when I was seven.
"In 1957 when I was seven years old, I knew I was going to die after my jealous cousin jerked the reins of a horse and 
        the horse galloped into the desert with my foot caught in the stirrup.  I then witnessed Uncle DeMar Rust stop the horse, physically take my foot out of the stirrup, wink and disappear.” While he was being rushed to the hospital with his wrist bleeding very badly, Steve asked his mother if she had seen Uncle DeMar.  She broke into tears because she had just buried him in Salt Lake City six months earlier.” All Steve's life he didn’t feel a part of his family.  “I look totally different from my three brothers and sister,” he said.  But why did I look exactly like Uncle DeMar?  At seven, I began to investigate!”  
        
Steve was very curious about “guardian angels” and why he had one. He began talking with LDS Institute students and searched the Institute library for information about angels.  He learned he should extend his hand and challenge any angelic visitor (Doctrine & Covenants 29:1–9). Beginning in 1957 he started reading his ancestor Parley P. Pratt’s Autobiography because of Pratt's spiritual experiences. 
        
        ﻿
“When I was 8 years old I became a Mormon through my father baptizing me.  I am still a member of the church founded by Joseph Smith.” 
        
Atomic Nuclear Testing
“In June, 1960, my mother’s father, Woodruff Rust, mysteriously died at the young age of 57. He owned the Hotel Kanab and the North Rim Lodge at the Grand Canyon.” Anna Belle left Tucson, Arizona and buried her father in Salt Lake City. “To connect all the ‘dots’ of secrecy and the CIA/NSA with the Mormon Church, newly called Apostle Howard W. Hunter came to Tucson, Arizona in June, 1960 (just before the death of Woodruff in Salt Lake City) and called Dr. H. Clyde Davis to be in charge of all Institutes and Religion teachers under the employment of the Mormon Church and create a ‘new direction.’ ”  By October conference time Steve's mother was very upset when she discovered her father died due to nuclear fallout of the government's Nevada testing.  Clyde was the whistleblower of the Nevada Open Air Testing of Nuclear bombs when he found a memo in the file stating the tests would only happen when the air was going NE into Utah. President Harry S. Truman, 33rd degree Mason, had signed the order for the Nevada nuclear testing to destroy the Mormons. He shared this information with US Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson and President Eisenhower and stopped the testing.
Three Prophetic Dreams and my October 29, 1960 Near Death Experience
        “On October 26, 1960 my mother had an exact dream of one of her sons having a head injury.  The next night she had an identical dream.  The third night was the same.  After three consecutive dreams she knew that her oldest son was going to have an auto accident with his scooter.  He was 15 and his name was hot “Rod”.  He was very careless because rarely did he have a father home to discipline him.  She didn’t dream it didn't deal with my brother.  I was the “target”.  While in a coma, I saw my 10-year-old physical body down on an operating table and I knew I was dying.  I saw someone approaching me.  I knew what to do.  I extended my hand and challenged this spiritual being and asked, ‘Who are you?’ (as instructed for anyone since 1843, D&C 129).  The angel extended his ‘spiritual hand’ and stated, 
        ‘I am Angel Moroni.  You need to restore what I delivered back in 1827.  Are you willing to do that?’  After I said, ‘Yes,’ I experienced three days in a coma.  I remember everything that happened, like it was yesterday, today.”
        
“Famous Chicago Catholic Head Surgeon, Dr. Fonseca, was present at St. Mary’s Catholic Hospital visiting a relative as the Arizona Highway patrol car arrived with my lifeless body.  He successfully removed the bullet and part of my damaged skull.  If I had died, Clyde Davis, would have been arrested for negligent homicide and for that sole reason, the cop didn’t wait for an ambulance because he figured I was going to die before I arrived at the hospital.  After I woke up from my 3 day coma, over 12,000 telephone calls, telegrams and letters flooded the hospital during my 35 days.  By the time Dr. Fonseca operated and placed a metal plate of my ‘hole’ I had been interviewed by the news media from all over the world, plus tens of thousands of prayer and support messages.  The rifle that shot me was a 30/40 caliber rifle, much more powerful than the rifle that killed President John F. Kennedy.  My brains should have blown away when the bullet hit me.  Anna Belle was very calm after the gun shot wound.  She knew what to do (from her dream).  Just before Dr. Fonseca operated and placed a metallic plate over the hole (left side above and in front of my ear) this doctor thanked me for allowing him to again believe in ‘angels’ because he had turned to atheism.        
“President Eisenhower spoke with me after I recovered and I shared with him information from my three day coma, telling him I got the same information given to the Apostle Paul, 1950 years earlier.  President Eisenhower turned over the CIA funding (Jones Trust, Central Dominion Bank Account, NY Federal Reserve Bank) of $6 Trillion to Ezra Taft Benson and Clyde Davis.”
Legal Background
"I am not an attorney.  I attended one full year (1974 - 75 at Northrop University—straight A's) in law school.  The professors were all California judges and they told me not to become an "agent" for the California bar.  For several years while I was Assistant to the President at Northrop, I took several Aerospace Engineering classes. I then took several Mining Engineering Classes while I was the General Manager for the College of Mines and Mineral Science at the University of Utah.  This was followed by  two years of law classes at Utah Valley State College when I became a Paralegal/Private Investigator/Expert Witness.
College and Early Career
        “I am a Business College Graduate (and International Finance Degree; double major), and the professional engineer through hands on experience.  When I was Senior Vice President at Newberry Engineering (Tempe, AZ public company) I had 150 professional engineers working on government contracts all throughout the western US.  I had access to any of these experts in the Air Cargo Airport Project.  This was all back during the 1970s. (I also received my Gemolgist/Certifed Diamond Appraiser License; Utah Securities License; Utah Real Estate License during this time, too).        
When in January, 1848 the Quorum of the Twelve and members of the Church, through majority vote (D&C 26, every April of every year) decided to have a Prophet govern the Church rather than the Quorum of the 12 (since 1835), the Church was cursed for three or four generations.        
This curse didn't apply to Steven Davis.  Apostle Parley P. Pratt disobeyed the Lord and participated with the majority of the members and Quorum.  The Church was cursed.  I am a fifth generation of Elder Pratt.        
Parley P. Pratt Memorial
        “Back in 1972 I commissioned Book of Mormon artist Arnold Friberg to design me a Memorial for Parley P. Pratt.  The design was endorsed by Church Historian and Apostle Howard W. Hunter back in 1975 while I was Assistant to the President, Northrop University, Inglewood, California and on National Radio with former California Governor Ronald Reagan concerning the largest Bi-Centennial Activity, AMERCIAN HALL OF AVIATION HISTORY, at LAX.  I was in charge of it.  I was the one who saved the Howard Hughes Spruce Goose.  In June, 1976 I got Missouri Governor Christopher Bond to remove the 1838 Extermination Order by Governor Boggs at an RLDS Stake Conference in Liberty, Missouri.  President Kimball didn’t want the Mormon Church involved in this removal in 1976.  I grew up in Tucson where Elder Kimball was a Thatcher/Safford Stake President and bank/insurance officer.        
﻿Aloe Vera Plantation
        “In the 1980s I purchased an aloe vera plantation on the Island of Dominica (first island discovered by Christopher Columbus) and developed an important product to enhance the immune system of the human body.        
LDS Bishop and Judge of Israel
        ﻿
        “In 1989 I was called by the President (former US Secretary of Agriculture) and his two counselors (Present President Hinckley and President Monson) of the Mormon Church to become a "prominent church leader" (one who is treated equally to the President, Apostles, and other leaders), a Bishop.        
In 1993 Dr. H. Clyde Davis sued Zions First National Bank for illegally removing money from his bank account.  Zions bank added me in the lawsuit.  In 1993 I contacted Church Leaders (Apostles) about their personal liability serving on this bank board and that we had evidence that would cause them to be excommunicated from the Mormon Church.  Two Apostles resigned from the bank board.  Two others refused to resigned (they worked with and under Dr. H. Clyde Davis for many years in the 1940s & 1950s).        
President Ezra Taft Benson believed in him and that he would fulfill the above promise from the Lord. President Benson knew all about his near death experience with Angel Moroni and called him to be a “judge of Israel” and a prominent church leader just before he gave his famous “pride” talk – condemning members for not reading and understanding the warnings found in the Book of Mormon about the condition of the “church” at the time of the Millennium (commencing April 6, 2000). Gordon Hinckley and Tom Monson, who became Presidents of the Mormon Church, also signed his Bishop’s Certificate, authorizing him to be a special witness for the Lord in 1989.        
In the 1960s I studied all the records of the Jewish, early Christian, Moslim eras at the University of Arizona and Brigham Young University with zeal and the desire to know why I was told certain things by the Angel Moroni while I was in a coma between October 29-31, 1960 at the St. Mary's Hospital, Tucson, Arizona.  The President of the United States called me after I came out of the coma.  He was praying for me with his Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Taft Benson because of the position of my father, Dr. H. Clyde Davis (he was the one who accidently shot me — chief geologist for the US Government) and the new presidential elections were the next week.  We all know how the 1960 Presidential Elections was controlled through the ballot fraud in certain states!  It was after my accidential shoting when President Eisenhower turned over the CIA Slush Fund to Benson (Central Dominion Trust, NY Federal Reserve Bank) - $6+ Trillion bank account.  This bank account was used commencing in September, 1985 using our agreement with Merrill Lynch to buy up over 300,000 Metric Ton of Gold all over the world.  I have filed these documents all over the world, exposing this stuff.  Why?  Because I was told by Angel Moroni that "truth needs to be spoken, especially those who have been converted to Jesus Christ and still need to be born-again (See John Chapter 8).
 ﻿Zions Bank Fraud
        “I was summoned to the Mormon Church Court in March, 1994 the same week we successfully settled with Zions bank in the law suit by Dr. H. Clyde Davis.  I attended a Church Court Council in May, 1994 for many hours defending myself.  The Mormon Church leader apologized and cancelled the rest of the hearing because I had a considerable amount of evidence proving fraud.   I continued as a very active member.  During this time I had another law suit against another "prominent church leader", Judge Pat B. Brian (a Utah State Judge).  I dropped my law suit against him (he had illegally/fraudulent brought a 2-day old baby from Dallas, Texas to me in Utah without Texas approving the adoption) because his wife was the sister of another Mormon Apostle.  He would have been excommunicated from the Mormon Church.        
Certain leaders were scared about being exposed by the evidence Dr. Davis and I had gathered.  Dr. Davis was retired and didn't want to proceed in either the "courts of the land" or the "courts of the Mormon Church".  I am still a member and active because of the illegal actions by Mr. Studdert.        
In November, 1995 another Mormon Church court in Utah (Stephen M. Studdert, former Assistant to three US presidents) was held without my knowledge.  At this time I was living in Nevada and knew nothing about this excommunication by Mr. Studdert.  He was the one who held the church court in 1994.   I properly notified the Mormon Church leaders and asked for a "hearing", using my rights as a baptized member of the Church.  To date, they haven't allowed me my membership rights to a  "re-hearing" challenging what Stephen M. Studdert did.  The following is the exact working in the Mormon Church doctrine about excommunication:        
“Should the parties or either of them be dissatisfied with the decision of said council, they may appeal to the high council of the seat of the First Presidency of the Church, and have a re-hearing, which case shall there be conducted, according to the former pattern written, as though no such decision had been made."  (Doctrine & Covenants 102:27).  You are welcome to ask Apostle Richard G. Scott or Apostle Jeffrey H. Holland if this is not the case.  Their telephone number is (801) 240-1000, Salt Lake City, Utah.        
“I am still a Mormon.  I attend Church.  I support it.  I am not a member of any other church but the one formed by Joseph Smith.        
Stephen M. Studdert = Inspector Javert (Les Misérables): 
        “Because of my father's position within the Freemasonry Operation of the US and my having survived his shooting accident (violating Arizona laws with a loaded rifle in the truck), many leaders are superstitious of me.  They monitor everything I do.  They try to copy-cat.  The Cities of Peace, designed by me back in 1965, happened because of a business my father was given by the owners of San Manuel, Arizona (a drug store).  They owned an underground copper mine and built a city in the mountains.  I saved them lots of money by flying cargo to their community, rather than trucking it through winding roads.        
I give full-disclosure about my life because of this "secret" monitoring.  It was headed up by my father until his mysterious death on Easter Weekend, 2006 in Provo, Utah.  He had signed an Affidavit five weeks earlier, supporting my Missouri operation, 100%.  He had repented and confessed for being a spy and high-level Mason with the One World Order since 1960 because he saw events happen as I had said. And I knew all about the corruption of the leaders of the LDS church, in spite of their sophisticated public relations/image.        
While in Brazil my father let me know his direct knowledge of mining operations he was directly involved with in Chile, South America, including mining claims of Alan Bond of Australia (became Barrick Gold).  Because of that knowledge I traveled to Vancouver several times and met with Jorge Lopehandia and warned him of the many death threats my father and I have received since the 1980s concerning our rights to the Bullfrog Mine operation.

When we appeared in court, he handled the situation perfectly and there were no charges filed and nothing on my record! I am so grateful for finding Patrick, trusting him with my case and now I continue to have a clean record thanks to him! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!Austin J.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations.
