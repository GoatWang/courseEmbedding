Did you know we’ve spent the past 150 years making the future more sustainable?







                    For 150 years, Voith’s technologies have been inspiring customers, business partners and employees around the world. Sustainable management is an important part of our history and is always reflected in our thoughts and actions. Founded in Germany in 1867, we’re one of Europe’s largest family-owned companies. We’ve always put sustainability first, right from when we first started making water turbines to generate power from water. Now we work on some of the world’s most efficient hydropower plants. Our papermachines have a long history too, producing a large proportion of the world’s paper, also using recycled stock. This ‘thinking green’ also helps us make the movement of people and goods cleaner and more efficient, and our services always seek to extract better results from fewer natural resources.

Why Voith?












Did you know our machines help make the money that’s spent by 1.24 billion people?







                    It was in 1859 that Johann Matthäus Voith built the first wood grinder for producing paper from wood fibre. Today, a large proportion of the world’s paper is produced on machines built by Voith Paper, one of four divisions that make Voith an important employer in over 60 countries. Our entire division is devoted to everything from the design to the start-up and maintenance of paper machines. The speciality papers our machines produce play an important part in everyday life. For example, almost all of India’s banknotes will be printed on paper produced by our machines.
