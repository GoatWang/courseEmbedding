Collecting Fan Insights
Our goal is to give your fans an experience they can’t find anywhere else. So every program, every practice and every innovation is grounded in insights gathered from our in-depth research on the fans themselves. 
Using methods like primary research studies and focus groups, among others, we rigorously analyze relevant data on evolving trends, tastes, habits and behaviors among your specific fan base. We then take those insights and transform them into programs and state-of-the art technologies that give your guests what they want. 
Whether it’s an easy mobile payment option or a venue-specific loyalty program, our extensive research makes for a better fan experience.


Real-Time Response
In order to create an unforgettable experience, it is our responsibility to be diligent in responding to fans’ needs as they arise. We have the tools and technology to monitor, measure, adjust and improve every detail of your fans’ experience in real-time.
We install management dashboards that provide our managers with a comprehensive, real-time look at daily operations.

Insight

                                    As the global health food trend grew, fans at stadiums and arenas across the country were seeking fresher choices in addition to traditional stadium menu options. At Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, our client and team members had an idea—to bring healthier, locally grown options into the stadium while promoting sustainability.

Innovation

                                    Working hand-in-hand with agriculture and landscape students from Colorado State University and the Colorado Rockies, we planned, planted and cultivated a first-of-its-kind sustainable garden outside Gate A of the ballpark. We then took the freshly harvested herbs and vegetables and used them in recipes and salad stations at the ballpark’s restaurant.

Impact

                                    The garden was a hit. Our team at Coors Field was not only building a more sustainable community and future but also providing fans and guests fresher menu options than they would get at a typical stadium. Going forward, we’ll look to continually innovate and improve our food services at all the stadiums and arenas we serve.

Insight

                                    Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado is a world-famous outdoor venue continually recognized for its star-studded concert roster and natural acoustics. It's also an important treasure to protect. One of Denver's sustainability goals  is to reduce landfill waste in the city by 20% overall by the year 2020. To help preserve the natural beauty of this venue, our team, along with our client the City of Denver, which owns and operates the amphitheater, are working with Eco-Products® to help increase the diversion rate at Red Rocks.

Innovation

                                    Working with Eco-Products®, we are now using sustainable food packaging - compostable cups, plates and trays – throughout the venue. The Eco-Products® packaging has a high quality look and feel and are embossed with a special logo reminding patrons that the packaging is compostable. The products can be disposed of in any of the venue’s trash bins and at the end of an event, after the Red Rocks employees collect and sort the waste, it is hauled away to be added to other compostable materials and ultimately turned into organic materials.

Impact

                                    Not all foodservice packaging can be recycled but by using Eco-Products® compostable packing, we are taking another step to keep food packaging out of landfills. With this new relationship, Red Rocks has been able to divert about 75 percent of the waste generated by events.
