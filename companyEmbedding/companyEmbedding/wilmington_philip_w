Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Cloud services lift SAP sales but costs tether profit growth
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    1:48 AM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


* Q2 revenue up 10.4 pct to 5.78 bln euros. * Core operating profit up 3 pct to 1.57 bln euros. * Oper profit hit by higher R&D/marketing costs. * Sales outlook edged up. By Eric Auchard. Newer cloud services powered a rise in second-quarter revenue at Germany's SAP but higher costs curbed profit growth, results from Europe's most valuable technology firm showed on Thursday.

















                                                    SAP quarterly profit shy of forecast on higher cloud costs

SAP, Europe's most valuable technology firm, posted rapid growth in internet-delivered cloud services, dampening near-term operating profit, which was slightly below forecasts the company blamed on higher cloud research and marketing costs.
