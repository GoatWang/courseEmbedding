MSDSonline – Your Partner in Compliance





GHS compliance deadlines are in full effect... are you prepared?




With more than 12,000 users and 8 million covered employees, MSDSonline solutions from VelocityEHS are the leading cost-effective, cloud-based tools that	help thousands of businesses across a variety of industries manage global hazard communication (HazCom) regulatory compliance requirements. When you partner with VelocityEHS, you partner with a pioneering innovator. Our MSDSonline solutions are transforming chemical management by making EHS information more accessible to employees than ever before through mobile technology. For instance, our eBinder app syncs with your account to provide easy online or offline access to safety data sheets, product summaries, inventory information and more. And our Chemical Inventory Scanner app makes it simple to scan and search barcodes or QR labels for access to crucial chemical container details from any smart phone or tablet.  Key to our mission is helping workplace safety professionals around the world prepare and manage the transition to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals – better known as GHS – perhaps the most significant regulatory change to hit the EHS industry.  We're here to be your partner in EH&S compliance.












GHS / Hazard Communication (HazCom) Compliance   Global hazard communication (i.e. US OSHA HazCom / Canada WHMIS / EU CLP) regulatory requirements continue to evolve. Just maintaining the status quo puts workers at risk and increases employer liability. Are you in compliance?  MSDSonline can help. Our award-winning HQ and HQ RegXR Accounts enable you to better understand the composition of the chemicals at your workplace and mitigate the associated hazards. We can help put you back on the path to compliance.   Request Demo 




Chemical / Environmental  Management & Compliance   Properly maintaining regulated materials at your workplace starts with a clear understanding of exactly what chemicals you have on site, where they are used, and the precise quantities you have stored. It's no easy task. Our HQ RegXR Account provides powerful container-level chemical management, tracking and reporting tools, plus a sophisticated regulatory cross-reference (RegXR) engine that identifies chemicals on federal, state and international hazardous substance lists.     Request Demo 




OSHA Recordkeeping Management & Compliance  Managing workplace injury and illness records on paper is costly and cumbersome.  What's more employers who fail to maintain up-to-date and accurate records may find themselves facing citation and fines. VelocityEHS has responded by developing a cloud-based OSHA Recordkeeping solution to help safety professionals better understand and manage their risks, simplify compliance and create a safer work environment. Take the pain out of Recordkeeping.   Request Demo

VelocityEHS Named a 2017 Green Quadrant Leader for Ease of Use & Mobile Functionality

Full story











  SDS Management Why MSDSonline    The Problem MSDSonline – a VelocityEHS solution – is focused on helping businesses of all sizes improve the management of chemical products and material safety data sheets, which today, are still largely underserved by paper-based SDS management systems and processes. We are also on the frontline of helping companies manage their transition to GHS – click here for our GHS / HCS Compliance Checklist. A safety data sheet is a required document that contains information for the safe handling, use, storage and disposal of potentially hazardous chemicals.  Global agencies like the UN, OSHA, EPA, EU and Health Canada, require that all potentially hazardous chemicals have information on file to ensure the safety of all personnel that are involved in manufacturing, distributing, transporting and using these materials in their day-to-day operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates that there are 4.5 million facilities in the United States that handle chemical materials, which require material safety data sheets. According to OSHA's CFR 1910.1200 (better known in EH&S circles as the Hazard Communication Standard or HCS), manufacturers and distributors are required to deliver a safety data sheet to each buyer of these materials. In turn, buyers, or employers, are required to make this information readily accessible to their employees who may come in contact with chemicals in the workplace. Prior to the widespread use of the internet and corporate intranets, safety data sheet management consisted of libraries containing large three-ring binders. Management of these paper-based binders is costly, cumbersome, and often leads to noncompliance with HCS regulations. As a result, failure to comply with HCS is one of the most frequently cited OSHA violations annually, costing businesses millions in fines, penalties and litigation expenses. Our Solution VelocityEHS has has responded by developing revolutionary, on-demand (cloud-computing), EH&S  management solutions. Through our MSDSonline chemical management brand, we pioneered online safety data sheet access, management and employee right-to-know compliance solutions more than 15 years ago.  We provide customers with access to our industry's leading online database of safety data sheets, which today, contains millions of indexed, manufacturer-original documents. Unlike competitors, the MSDSonline database is dynamic. We add more than 20,000 new and/or updated safety data sheets each week. Our MSDS management solutions combine access to our database with easy-to-use inventory management and data sheet deployment tools. This enables more cost-effective compliance with OSHA's HCS, Health Canada's Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) requirements, the European Commission's REACH regulation, as well as the more recently adopted elements of the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Our online solutions create a simplified SDS management system so your company can focus on safety.   Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) professionals are continuously asked to do more with fewer resources. The demands for staying compliant are getting more difficult no matter what industry you're in or how big your organization is. Managing your chemical inventory and training your employees on how to evaluate and avoid risks from hazards is critical to your business.  A minor accident or chemical exposure can have serious implications in terms of lost productivity, skyrocketing insurance costs and workers' compensation claims, not to mention possible litigation costs and fines for non-compliance.  At VelocityEHS, our goal, through our MSDSonline solutions, is to help businesses of all sizes improve workplace safety, and ultimately, simplify hazard communication compliance.
 
Whether that's providing simple access to a safety data sheet, developing products and services to help build and maintain a compliant SDS inventory (see our GM Account), delivering a fully compliant electronic employee Right-to-Know solution (see our HQ Account), or providing a robust environmental management solution (see our HQ RegXR Account) — we understand the importance of protecting your most valuable assets — your employees.
