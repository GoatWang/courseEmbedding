American Securities Partners V | Press Release | American Securities
Englishback to newsSeptember 2, 2008American Securities Closes Unprecedented 25-Year Private Equity FundAmerican Securities, a leading middle-market private equity firm with a successful history of investing with management teams and business owners for the long-term, today announced the closing of American Securities Partners V, an unprecedented 25-year investment fund with committed capital of more than $2.3 billion.
ASP V is the fifth fund raised by American Securities. The firm and its affiliates now have approximately $6 billion under management. American Securities is led by seven Managing Directors who average more than 14 years each at American Securities. They are Michael G. Fisch, Charles D. Klein, David L. Horing, Paul Rossetti, Glenn B. Kaufman, Matthew F. LeBaron and Marc L. Saiontz.
The American Securities team includes more than 20 investment professionals as well as the firm’s unique 14-person Resources Group which exists to support American Securities’ portfolio company management teams. The Resources Group is comprised of senior executives with specific functional expertise in areas such as strategy, operational excellence, IT and Asia product sourcing.
American Securities is headquartered in New York where most of its professionals are located. The Firm also has a 16-person Shanghai office which, among other things, advises portfolio companies on Asia-Pacific strategy, product and component sourcing, local partnering, and building manufacturing facilities in Asia.
In announcing the closing of ASP V, American Securities President and CEO Michael Fisch said, “We are delighted to continue building on our long-standing high net worth family and endowment relationships in ASP V. We are also pleased to have attracted select new investors, a number of whom are international investors that expand our geographic reach on behalf of our U.S.-based portfolio companies to additional countries around the world. Our investors understand our enthusiasm to help managers build their companies for the long-term. The unique 25-year investment horizon of this partnership will allow us to continue to create high long-term, risk-adjusted rates of return for our management partners and investors.

May 24, 2011







New York-based private equity firm American Securities has completed a majority investment in SpecialtyCare, a provider of outsourced perfusion, clinical technician, minimally invasive surgical support services. Terms of the deal were kept under wraps. Five-year-old SpecialtyCare is based in Nashville. Equity for the deal was provided by American Securities Partners V, L.P.
PRESS RELEASE
American Securities, a New York-based private equity firm, today announced that it has completed a majority investment in SpecialtyCare, the largest and most experienced provider of outsourced perfusion, clinical technician, minimally invasive surgical support services, and other specialty clinical services in the United States.  Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  Equity was provided by American Securities Partners V, L.P., a $2.3 billion private equity partnership.
Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, SpecialtyCare was founded five years ago and today serves more than 525 hospitals, including more than 170 cardiac surgery programs at hospitals in 40 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Germany.  In addition to perfusion, autotransfusion, minimally invasive surgical support services and anesthesia technician services, SpecialtyCare’s clinicians provide surgical assist, intraoperative neurological monitoring, and sterile processing department services.  The company employs more than 900 clinicians who support more than 280,000 surgical procedures annually.

This will support the next stage of SpecialtyCare’s growth as we continue to provide a comprehensive suite of high quality, outsourced clinical services to hospitals and other healthcare providers.  We are excited to continue to grow and improve our company with American Securities’ support.”
