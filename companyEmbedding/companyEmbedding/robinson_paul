I've been part of one of the largest IPO's of an Irish company, and have set up and ran my own company with six departments ranging from IT support, technical writers and editors, software developers, project managers and sales teams. At our peak we had 80+ employees, with an annual turnover of $2 million, our product line required very tight control with small margins, and we were competing with Asia so our overall processes were constantly being refined to maintain profit. More recently I've worked for a Venture Capital Company in helping one of their fledgling seed operations to establish and launch a new product in the Mobile Field Service Sector.

									Paul Robinson is one of the world’s leading criminal law scholars. A prolific writer and lecturer, Robinson has published articles in virtually all of the top law reviews, lectured in more than 100 cities in 33 states and 27 countries, and had his writings appear in 13 languages. A former federal prosecutor and counsel for the US Senate Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures, he was the lone dissenter when the US Sentencing Commission promulgated the current federal sentencing guidelines. He is the author or editor of 15 books, including the standard lawyer’s reference on criminal law defenses, three Oxford monographs on criminal law theory, a highly regarded criminal law treatise, and an innovative case studies course book.He is the lead editor of Criminal Law Conversations (Oxford), a  debate involving more than 100 scholars from around the world, and the author of Intuitions of Justice and the Utility of Desert (Oxford); Distributive Principles of Criminal Law (Oxford, also in Spanish and Chinese); and Structure and Function in Criminal Law (Oxford, also in Chinese). Robinson recently completed two criminal code reform projects in the United States and the first modern Islamic penal code under the auspices of the U.N. Development Program. He is currently commissioned to draft criminal codes for Delaware and Somalia. He also writes for general audiences, including popular books such as Would You Convict? (NYU), Law Without Justice (Oxford),  Pirates, Prisoners, and Lepers: Lessons from Life Outside the Law (Potomac),  Shadow Vigilantes: How Distrust in the Justice System Breeds a New Kind of Lawlessness (Prometheus forthcoming), and Tragedy, Outrage & Reform: Crimes that Changed Our World  (Rowman & Littlefield forthcoming).
