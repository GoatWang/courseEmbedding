Flexsteel Industries, Inc.








View larger image



Using SolidWorks Professional design software, Flexsteel Industries has improved accuracy and increased productivity in the development of its furniture products.



SUCCESS METRICS

Shortened product development cycles by five to seven weeks Reduced errors and rework by 40 percent Cut prototyping requirements by 30 percent Introduced new custom-configured business model




Watch Video

 View Case Study 







The Challenge
Named for the famous “flexsteel” spring that revolutionized furniture comfort, Flexsteel Industries, Inc., has led the North American furniture industry for over a century. In 2008, Flexsteel’s Contract Furniture Group decided to upgrade its product development platform from AutoCAD® 2D tools to a 3D design system to increase productivity and improve accuracy.
The Solution
After evaluating several 3D packages, including Unigraphics®, Pro/ENGINEER®, and SolidWorks® software, Flexsteel chose SolidWorks Professional design software. Flexsteel selected SolidWorks software because it’s easy to use; includes visualization, configuration, and surfacing tools; and provides the smoothest transition path from 2D. The company also acquired 3DVIA Composer™ technical communications software, with which it plans to improve product and manufacturing documentation. By implementing SolidWorks, Flexsteel shortened its product development cycles by five to seven weeks, reduced errors and associated rework by 40 percent, cut prototyping requirements by 30 percent, and introduced a new custom-configured business model.







						"SolidWorks has enabled
Flexsteel to reduce time
and costs by taking the fat
out of our development
cycle as we strive to make
it as lean as possible." 
					

						- Andrew Rudisill , Engineering SolidWorks Supervisor

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Care & Cleaning InstructionsEach piece of Flexsteel furniture is crafted to bring years of beauty to your home. To ensure that your furniture stays looking beautiful, we suggest the following tips for cleaning and maintenance.WoodDo not expose wood furniture to extreme heat or humid conditions. Do not place your furniture in direct sunlight or in a damp area. Avoid arranging your furniture so that it is placed in front of or over heating and air conditioning vents.Do not place plastic, rubber, or hot objects on your wood furniture. Chemicals in such objects may soften or discolor the finish. To avoid such damage, apply a strip of felt, leather, or cork under accessories. Also, occasionally rotate accessories so they do not remain in the same spot for extended periods of time.Lift objects from the top surface rather than dragging them across the finish when moving them.Use a protective pad when using your furniture as a writing surface (especially when using a ballpoint pen).Small scratches that occur with normal use can be touched up with a scratch remover or special touch-up pens or sticks available at your furniture dealer or at many paint stores.Dust frequently with a clean dry, lint-free cloth. For a more thorough cleaning, the furniture may be washed with a mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly using a clean, lint-free cloth and wipe with the grain. A furniture polish may be applied for more shine. We recommend this type of cleaning every six months to remove accumulated dust and furniture wax buildup.Do not use water, alcohol, lacquer thinner, acetone, or any alcohol-based cleaning products.Spilled liquids should be wiped from the surface immediately with a soft, damp cloth. Always wipe the furniture in the direction of the wood grain.Cane & WickerDo not use water, alcohol, lacquer thinner, acetone, or any alcohol-based cleaning products.Vacuum with a soft brush to remove dust; hard-bristle brushes will mar the surface.Wipe the surface with furniture polish and a soft, dry cloth for regular surface cleaning.Marble, Stone, & ConcreteDo not use alcohol, lacquer thinner, acetone, or any alcohol-based cleaning products.Spills should immediately be blotted with a dry cloth. Use a lightly water-dampened cloth to remove any residue; then dry with a soft cloth and apply furniture polish.MetalDo not use water, alcohol, lacquer thinner, acetone, mineral spirits or any alcohol-based cleaning products.Dust regularly with furniture polish and a soft cloth or chamois.GlassWipe the surface with glass cleaner and a soft cloth to remove dust, spills, or fingerprints.Do not place hot items (e.g., pans, dishes, irons) directly on this surface.
