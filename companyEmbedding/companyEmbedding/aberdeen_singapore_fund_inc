A concentrated portfolio of Singapore exchange-listed companiesresearched first-hand by our dedicated team of professionalslocated in the region.





















								Investment Objective




The Fund’s investment objective is capital appreciation, which it seeks through investment primarily in Singapore equity securities. The Fund also, to a lesser degree, invests in equity securities issued by companies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (the “ASEAN Group”) countries.
Investment Policies 
Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in Singapore equity securities.

Factsheet
Commentary

Risk Considerations
International investing entails special risk considerations, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, economic and political risks, and differences in accounting methods; these risks are generally heightened for emerging market countries.
Concentrating investments in the Singapore region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds. Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.

								What is a Closed-End Fund?




The term ‘closed-end fund’ refers to a fund that issues a fixed number of shares to investors and does not issue new shares once the initial shares are sold.
What does the term, ‘Closed-End Fund’ mean?
Closed-end funds are so named because they issue, or sell, a fixed number of shares to investors during an initial public offering (IPO). Once the IPO is completed, the transaction is closed, meaning that no additional shares will be available from the fund sponsor. After the IPO, closed-end funds trade on an exchange, like the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, and investors can buy and sell shares of a fund just as they would stocks. The fund company does not issue new shares, nor redeem existing shares. At times, additional shares may be created through a secondary offering, rights offering or by issuing shares for dividend reinvestment.
Like other investment funds, closed-end funds are a publicly traded investment company that follows a stated investment objective when making investments. Investment professionals, who typically invest in various types of securities to meet a specific investment strategy, actively manage closed-end funds.
The total value of the securities held in the portfolio of a closed-end fund is calculated to determine a collective portfolio value, which is then divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the Net Asset Value (NAV).
The actual price of a closed-end fund in the market may differ from the calculated NAV because the market price may be influenced by other factors, including supply and demand. When supply is greater than demand, the price of a closed-end fund may be less than its NAV and is said to be trading at a discount. If demand is greater than supply, then the closed-end fund’s price will be higher than its NAV and is said to be trading at a premium.
Historical Snapshot of Closed-End Funds
Closed-end funds have existed for more than 120 years. They appeared in the United States in 1893 with the launch of the first U.S.-based, closed-end fund, the Boston Personal Property Trust.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 was created by Congress to provide guidelines for new investment vehicles called pooled investments or investment funds and to restore investor confidence following the 1929 stock market crash. The ‘40 Act, as it is commonly known, has supported the growth of the investment fund industry.
At present, there are more than 600 closed-end funds, totaling nearly $300 billion in assets. Some of these funds have long-standing management and a performance history that extends more than 50 years. Investors tend to buy and hold closed-end funds shares for long periods. As such, it’s common that shares are passed from one generation to the next.

Important InformationAberdeen Asset Management Inc. has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.  However, the figures are unaudited and neither the Fund, Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the Administrator), Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the Investment Manager), nor any other person guarantees their accuracy.  Investors should seek their own professional advice and should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before acting on this information. 
Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower.  Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date July 31, 1990.

	PROXY STATEMENT






	INTRODUCTION





	This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the ABERDEEN SINGAPORE FUND, INC., a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting"), to be held at the offices of Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, on Wednesday, June 21, 2017, at 11:30 a.m., Philadelphia time and at any adjournments thereof. A Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and a proxy card accompany this Proxy Statement. This Proxy Statement and proxy card are first being made available to stockholders on or about May 8, 2017.




	All properly executed proxy cards received in time for the Meeting will be voted as specified in the proxy card or, if no specification is made, FOR the proposed election of Director (the "Proposal"). The persons named as proxy holders on the Proxy will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Any stockholder giving a proxy in advance of the Meeting has the power to revoke it by mail (addressed to the Secretary of the Fund, c/o Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103), by executing a superseding proxy or by attending the Meeting in person and voting at the Meeting. Shares owned by any stockholder who attends the Meeting but does not cast a vote are included in the determination of the number of shares present at the Meeting. Stockholders do not have dissenter's rights of appraisal in connection with any of the matters to be voted on by the stockholders at the Meeting.




	The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting on any matter shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the Meeting, withheld votes and broker 'non-votes' (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular proposal with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present at the Meeting.




	With regard to approval of the Proposal, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary for the election of a Director. For purposes of the election of Directors for the Fund, any abstentions or broker 'non-votes' will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote.




	On September 16, 2015, the Fund announced that the Board of Directors adopted certain corporate governance guidelines for the Fund which became effective September 30, 2015. The corporate governance guidelines include (i) a resignation policy which generally provides that an Independent Director, in an uncontested election, who does not receive a majority of votes "FOR" his or her election at a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed to have tendered his or her resignation, subject to the Board's acceptance or rejection of such resignation, which Board determination will be disclosed publicly to Fund stockholders; and (ii) a policy requiring that after an Independent Director has served on the Board for three consecutive terms of three years following the engagement of the existing investment manager of the Fund that Independent Director will be put forth for consideration by shareholders annually. The failure to obtain a majority of votes cast will trigger the resignation policy described above.









	3









	If a quorum is not present in person or by proxy at the time a Meeting is called to order, the chairman of the Meeting or the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or by proxy may adjourn the Meeting without notice other than announcement at the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. If a quorum is present but there are not sufficient votes to approve the Proposal, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting, or may permit the persons named as proxy holders to propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting, to permit further solicitation of proxies on the Proposal. If the persons named as proxy holders propose to adjourn the Meeting, the vote required for stockholders to adjourn the Meeting is the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast on the matter. In such a case, the persons named as proxy holders will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the Proposal "FOR" the adjournment, and will vote those proxies required to be voted against, or withholding authority to vote for, the Proposal "AGAINST" the adjournment. For purposes of votes with respect to adjournment, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. If a quorum is present and a motion for adjournment is not approved, the voting on the Proposal will be completed at the Meeting. Absent the establishment of a subsequent record date and the giving of notice to the holders of record thereon, the adjourned Meeting must take place not more than 120 days after the record date. At such adjourned Meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Meeting




	The Board has fixed the close of business on April 28, 2017 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and at any adjournments thereof. Stockholders on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote for each share held, with no shares having cumulative voting rights. As of the Record Date, the Fund had outstanding 7,418,948 shares of common stock.




	The Fund's management knows of no business other than that mentioned in the Notice of Meeting, which will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy card to vote in accordance with their discretion.




	Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to Be Held on Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103: The Proxy Materials and the Fund's most recent annual report are available on the Internet at http://www.aberdeen-asset.us/cef. The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its Annual Report for its most recent fiscal year to any stockholder requesting such report. Requests for the Annual Report should be made by writing to the Fund's investor relations program at Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. ("AAMI") at AAMI's principal executive offices, c/o Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, attention: Aberdeen Singapore Fund, Inc.: Investor Relations, or by calling collect at 1-800-522-5465.





	THE FUND'S BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL DESCRIBED IN THE NOTICE OF MEETING.

	Proposal: ELECTION OF DIRECTOR





	Persons named in the proxy card intend, in the absence of contrary instructions, to vote all proxies FOR the election of the nominee listed below as a Director of the Fund.




	(i)  Richard Herring, as a Class II Director, to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies.




	The term of the nominee for Director will expire on the date on which Directors are elected at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Fund in the year stated above or the date that his successor is elected and qualified. If any such nominee should be unable to serve due to an event that is not now anticipated, the proxies will be voted for such person, if any, as shall be designated by the Board to replace any such nominee. The election of the nominee as Directors of the Fund will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting at which a quorum is present. A majority of the Fund's outstanding shares as of the Record Date, represented in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum of stockholders at the Meeting. For purposes of the Proposal, withholding of authority to vote for the nominee will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting, and will be treated as votes cast against the nominee at the Meeting.




	The nominee for Director of the Fund has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve as a Director of the Fund if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that the nominee named above will become unavailable for election as a Director, but if that should occur before the meeting for the Fund, the persons named as proxies in the proxy cards will vote for such person(s) as the Board of the Fund may recommend.

	Information Concerning Directors and Nominee





	The following table sets forth information concerning the nominee for Director of the Fund, as well as the other current Directors of the Fund. Neither the Director nominee nor any other Director of the Fund is considered to be an "interested person" (as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) of the Fund ("Independent Directors").

	†  Nominee for Director.





	Additional Information about the Board of Directors





	The Board believes that each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Directors on the Board lead to the conclusion that each Director should serve on the Board. The Board believes that each Director's ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to him; to interact effectively with Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited ("AAMAL"), the Fund's investment manager, other services providers, counsel, and independent auditors; and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of his duties, support this conclusion. The Board has also considered the contributions that each Director can make to the Board and Fund.




	A Director's ability to contribute effectively may have been attained through the Director's executive, business, consulting, and/or academic positions; experience from service as a Director of the Fund and other funds/portfolios in the Aberdeen fund complex, other investment funds, public companies, non-profit entities or other organizations; educational background or professional training or practice; and/or other life experiences. In this regard, the following specific experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills apply as to each Director. Mr. Harmerbusiness background, accounting expertise and executive management experience as a president, chairman chief financial officer, corporate controller and a director of various private and governmental entities and director of another fund within the Aberdeen complex; Mr. Herringfinancial background as professor of finance and board experience with other closed-end investment companies and public companies and director of another fund within the Aberdeen complex; Mr. Porterbusiness background and executive management and financial expertise as vice president and chief financial officer of public and private entities and director of other funds within the Aberdeen complex; and Mr. Selldirector and executive experience at an investment banking and trading firm and board experience with other funds within the Aberdeen complex.




	The Board believes that the significance to the Fund of each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills is an individual matter (meaning that it may vary by individual) and that these factors are best evaluated at the Board level, with no particular factor being indicative of effectiveness. In addition, in its periodic self-assessment of its effectiveness, the Board considers the complementary individual skills and experience to oversee the business of the Fund. References to the experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills of Directors are presented pursuant to disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), do not constitute holding out the Board or any Director as having any special expertise or experience, and should not be considered to impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.




	Based on the information furnished by each of the Directors as of March 31, 2017, neither any of the Directors nor any immediate family member of the Directors owned any securities of the investment manager, or any of its affiliates, of the Fund as of such date.




	The Fund's Board held three regular meetings and no special meetings during its fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Each current Director attended at least seventy-five percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board








	8









	and any Committee of which he was a member. For annual or special stockholder meetings, Directors may but are not required to attend the meetings; and for the Fund's last annual stockholder meeting, Mr. Sell attended the meeting.




	The Board has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which is responsible for reviewing financial and accounting matters. The members of the Fund's Audit Committee are independent as defined in Sections 303A.02 and 303A.07(a) of the New York Stock Exchange's (the "NYSE") Listed Company Manual, as may be modified or supplemented. The Fund has adopted a formal, written Audit Committee Charter, a copy of which is available at www.aberdeensgf.com. The current members of the Fund's Audit Committee are Messrs. Harmer, Herring, Porter and Sell. Mr. Porter has been designated as the Fund's "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR, and is presumed to be financially sophisticated for purposes of Section 802B(2) of the NYSE US LLC Company Guide.




	The Fund's Audit Committee met three times during its fiscal year. The report of the Fund's Audit Committee, along with certain disclosures regarding fees paid to the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, are set forth on pages 13 to 15 of this Proxy Statement.




	The Board has a Nominating and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for recommending individuals to the Board for nomination as members of the Board and its committees. The Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee is composed of Directors who are not interested persons of the Fund and comply with the independence requirements of the NYSE listing standards for Nominating and Compensation Committee members. The Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee's actions are governed by the Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee Charter, a copy of which is available at www.aberdeensgf.com. The current members of the Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee are Messrs. Harmer, Herring, Porter and Sell. The Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee did not meet during its last fiscal year.





	Process of Evaluation of Independent Director Candidates





	The Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee identifies individuals qualified to serve as Independent Directors on the Board and on committees of the Board and recommends such qualified individuals for nomination by the Fund's Independent Directors as candidates for election as Independent Directors, advises the Board with respect to Board composition, procedures and committees, monitors and makes recommendations on corporate governance matters and policies and procedures of the Board and any Board committees and oversees periodic evaluations of the Board and its committees. Persons recommended by the Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee as candidates for nomination as Independent Directors are required to possess such knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity so as to enhance the Board's ability to manage and direct the affairs and business of the Fund, including, when applicable, to enhance the ability of committees of the Board to fulfill their duties and/or to satisfy any independence requirements imposed by law, regulation or any listing requirements of the NYSE. While the Independent Directors of the Fund expect to be able to continue to identify from their own resources an ample number of qualified candidates for the Board as they deem appropriate, they will consider nominations from stockholders to the Board. Nominations from stockholders should be in writing and sent to the Independent Directors as described herein. Assuming that appropriate biographical and background material is provided for Independent Director candidates recommended by stockholders, the Board will evaluate those candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as for candidates identified by the Independent Directors of the Fund.

	Diversity Policy





	The Fund's policy on Board diversity provides that while diversity and variety of experiences and viewpoints represented on the Board should always be considered, a nominee for Director should not be chosen nor excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual orientation or identity. In selecting a nominee for Director, the Fund's Nominating and Compensation Committee focuses on skills, expertise or background that would complement the existing Board, recognizing that the Fund's business and operations are diverse and global in nature.





	Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight





	The Fund is focused on its corporate governance practices and values independent Board oversight as an essential component of strong corporate performance to enhance stockholder value. The Fund's commitment to independent oversight is demonstrated by the fact that all of its Directors are independent. In addition, all of the members of the Board's committees are independent. The Board acts independently of management and regularly holds independent director sessions of the Board without members of management present.




	The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. Risk oversight forms part of the Board's general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. The Fund's investment manager and other service providers also employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various events or circumstances that give rise to risks, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. In addition, the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer compiles a risk assessment for the Fund which is reviewed by the Board. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. As part of its regular oversight of the Fund, the Board interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the Fund's investment manager, the Fund's administrator, the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and counsel, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and applicable risk controls. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight.





	Stockholder Communications





	Stockholders may send communications to the Board. Stockholders should send communications intended for the Board by addressing the communication directly to the Board (or individual Board members) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation that the communication is for the Board (or individual Board members) and by sending the communication to either the Fund's office or directly to such Board member(s) at the address specified for each Director above. Other stockholder communications received by the Fund not directly addressed and sent to the Board will be reviewed and generally responded to by management, and will be forwarded to the Board only at management's discretion based on the matters contained therein.

	Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited serves as the investment manager to the Fund and its principal office is located 21 Church Street #01-01, Capital Square Two, Singapore 049480. AAMAL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC. On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen Asset Management PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share merger ("Merger"). Following the completion of the Merger, Aberdeen Asset Management PLC shareholders would own approximately one-third of the combined group while Standard Life plc shareholders would own approximately two-thirds. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including approval by shareholders of both entities.




	AAMI serves as the administrator to the Fund and its principal office is located at 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.





	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE





	Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, as applied to the Fund, requires the Fund's officers and Directors, certain officers and directors of the investment manager, affiliates of the investment manager and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Fund's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Commission and the NYSE.




	Based solely upon the Fund's review of the copies of such filings received by it and written representations from the Directors and officers of the Fund, and the filings by the beneficial holders greater than 10% of a Fund's shares, to the knowledge of the Fund, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the filings were filed on a timely basis.







	REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE





	At a meeting held on December 13, 2016, the Board of the Fund, a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), including a majority of the Directors who are not "interested persons," as defined under the 1940 Act, selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") to act as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund









	13









	for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2017. Although it is not expected that a representative of PWC will attend the Meeting, a representative will be available by telephone to make a statement to the stockholders, if the representative wishes to do so, and to respond to stockholder questions, if any.




	The Fund's financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were audited by PWC. The Audit Committee of the Fund has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Fund with management of the Fund. The Audit Committee of the Fund has received the written disclosures and the letter from PWC required by The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Rule 3526 (PCAOB Rule 1, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), as may be modified or supplemented, and have discussed with PWC its independence with respect to the Fund. The Fund knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of PWC in the Fund. The Audit Committee has discussed with PWC the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61 and PCAOB AS 16, as may be modified or supplemented. Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Audit Committee of the Fund has recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements of the Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 be included in the Fund's most recent annual report filed with the Commission.




	Rahn K. Porter, Chairman of the Audit Committee

	David G. Harmer, Member of the Audit Committee

	Richard J. Herring, Member of the Audit Committee

	Moritz A. Sell, Member of the Audit Committee





	Audit Fees





	The aggregate fees billed by PWC for professional services rendered in connection with the annual audit and review of the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $51,800 and $61,400, respectively.





	Audit-Related Fees





	The aggregate fees billed by PWC for assurance and related services related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $0, respectively.





	Tax Fees





	The aggregate fees billed by PWC for professional services rendered by PWC for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning (consisting of a review of the Fund's income tax returns and tax distribution requirements) for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,857 and $9,570, respectively.





	Other Fees





	There were no other fees billed by PWC for services rendered to the Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.





	Audit Committee Pre-approval





	The Fund's Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all auditing and non-auditing services to be provided to the Fund by the Fund's registered public accounting firm. All of the audit and the tax services described above for which PWC billed the Fund fees for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were pre-approved by the Fund's Audit Committee.




	The aggregate fees billed by PWC for non-audit services rendered to Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited, the Fund's investment manager ("AAMAL") or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with AAMAL that provided ongoing services to the Fund ("Covered Service Providers") for the fiscal year








	14









	ended October 31, 2017 were $11,070. The aggregate fees billed by PWC for non-audit services rendered to AAMAL and any Covered Service Providers for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were $9,857.




	The Audit Committee of the Fund has considered whether the provision of non-audit services rendered to the Fund's investment manager and affiliates of the investment manager of the Fund is compatible with maintaining the independence of PWC and has concluded it is.
