Leading By Example

A MESSAGE FROM LANCE MITCHELL, CEO Reynolds Consumer Products
We are proud of our well-known and trusted brands, including Reynolds Wrap® foil, Hefty® trash bags, slider bags, and disposable tableware, and in 2014, we added Alcan® foil, Canada’s top foil brand. Our goal is to continue to earn your trust and offer new products and product improvements that make running a household easier. 
How we do it is just as important as the products we sell. Integrity is extremely important to us; we drive results through combining innovation and teamwork.

We put safety first, always. Our customer relationships are based on a long history of trust. We work to make not only our individual products successful; but provide insights to our retailers that help improve the product category.
We're looking for people that will help us reach our goals, including professionals in marketing, HR, IT, operations, logistics/supply chain, finance, and more. Please take a few minutes to read what some of our employees think about working here.
