August 06, 2013 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Crescent Capital Group LP, a leading investment firm focused on below 
      investment grade credit, announces the successful close of Crescent 
      Mezzanine Partners VI (“Fund VI”). Investors committed more than $3.4 
      billion to Fund VI, meaningfully exceeding the initial fundraising 
      target of $2.5 billion and representing the largest private mezzanine 
      offering in Crescent Mezzanine’s history.
    


      “We are particularly grateful to the significant number of existing 
      limited partners that chose to participate in this fund,” said Jean-Marc 
      Chapus, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Crescent Capital Group. “We 
      are also pleased to welcome the support of a number of new investors in 
      Fund VI. We believe that our experience investing and sourcing in excess 
      of $10 billion of capital in over 150 mezzanine transactions on behalf 
      of our funds and co-investors for over 20 years was a key element to our 
      success.”
    

      The Crescent Mezzanine Group is a leading source of mezzanine capital, 
      providing private equity sponsors and management teams with long-term 
      financing to complete leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations 
      and later-stage growth financings. The group targets investments in 
      companies that are typically controlled by private equity sponsors and 
      have enterprise values in excess of $250 million.

FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ will bring your industrial or commercial work space to a whole new level!



Our steel mezzanines can economically transform your unused and unproductive overhead air space into valuable floor space that works for you.  Go ahead – create a second, third or fourth level because our mezzanine systems are fully engineered for superior strength, stability and function. In addition, our easy to install modular mezzanine design easily bolts together to allow for rapid installation, future expansion or even relocation.
Free-Space Mezzanines™ aren’t just for storage! Our rigid frame design is perfect for metal buildings, conveyor support, equipment platforms, in-plant offices, manufacturing activities, walkways or stair tower. Whatever you may need to support above floor level, FCP can create the right structure. Plus, with our design and use of lightweight, high-tensile materials, we are able to install the new structure over existing equipment or stored items with a minimum of support columns thereby maximizing the usable floor space under the mezzanine.
FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ are designed to comply with all applicable building codes: UBC, CBC and IBC; as well as meeting the rigorous specifications demanded in seismically active zones.
Codes & Specs
FCP Free-Space Mezzanine™ utilizes structural square tube columns to save space while creating superior rigidity. All components are designed to facilitate ease of installation. The high-tensile steel framing members and our rigid frame moment-connections allow greater spans and the ability to meet Seismic Zone 4 requirements.  Framing systems are designed to meet or exceed local, California and international building code standards. All FCP Free-Space Mezzanines TM follow the guidelines of the applicable code agencies ANSI, AISC, ASCE, UBC, CBC, BOCA, SBC, ADA and OSHA.
