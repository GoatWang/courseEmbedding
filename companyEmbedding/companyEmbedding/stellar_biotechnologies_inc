World-Leading Aquaculture


Stellar's Facilities, Production and Controls
Stellar Biotechnologies' research and manufacturing facilities are located directly along the Pacific Ocean.
Our California waterfront location is a proprietary asset that allows our marine scientists to work in close proximity to naturally resident Giant Keyhole Limpet (Megathura crenulata) colonies. Stellar is at the forefront in developing environmentally sound practices to protect this important marine species.
We operate the only facility of its kind - land-based aquaculture supporting the complete life cycle of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. This infrastructure gives Stellar in-house, controlled source for KLH. Other KH suppliers are dependent on sensitive, wild populations of the Giant Keyhole Limpet.
Our Aquaculture program is the culmination of decades of highly-specialized work and a range of disciplines. Stellar Biotechnologies manages the source, quality, and supply of KLH to a degree that no other company has achieved.
Environmental Advantage
Our aim is to protect the natural source for KLH to ensure that future immunotherapies have plentiful supply of high quality material.
Stellar Biotechnologies developed and optimized complex methods for the culture of limpets that led to the first-ever industry achievement of multiple generations of the Giant Keyhole Limpet (M. crenulata), thriving within our land-based aquaculture. We also pioneered proprietary methods for the extraction, purification, and separation of the KLH molecule.

What is KLH?


Intricate KLH Molecule

Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) is an important immune-stimulating protein with an extensive history of safe and effective use in immunotherapy (therapeutic vaccine) development.
This versatile molecule can be combined with a disease-targeting agent to create a novel immunotherapy, or used alone to assess the body’s immune response.  But KLH can only be obtained from a scarce marine source, the Giant Keyhole Limpet.  Our ground-breaking achievements in aquaculture science and KLH production ensure that this critical natural resource thrives.

Principle of The Anti-KLH ELISA Test
In drug screening applications, determination of a drug candidate's immunosuppressive effects on anti-KLH antibody levels allows easy assessment of immune system regulation. Animals are immunized with KLH while undergoing drug treatment and serum is collected at appropriate times post-immunization. Typically, serum collected 5-7 days after immunization is used for measurement of anti-KLH IgM levels, and serum collected 14+ days post immunization is used to measure anti-KLH IgG levels. Comparison of anti-KLH IgM or IgG levels in drug-treated vs. control groups reveals the effects of drug candidates on immune response.
Only Stellar KLH™ ELISA Test Kits are made using Stellar KLH™ protein and are designed for rapid and quantitative measurement of anti-KLH IgG and IgM levels in serum or plasma.
Stellar Biotechnologies offers a broad suite of Anti-KLH ELISA Test Kits, available to measure either IgG or IgM, in non-human primate (NHP), mouse and rat models.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is one of the fastest-growing areas of new drug development.  There are two main categories – Active Immunotherapy and Passive Immunotherapy. 
Active immunotherapies (a.k.a. therapeutic vaccines) involve internally stimulating the body’s own immune system to generate a targeted, durable treatment against a specific disease or condition.  Passive immunotherapies also employ the immune system but rely on antigen-specific antibodies engineered outside of the body which are repeatedly administered for treatment effect.
KLH in Active Immunotherapy

KLH can be used as a carrier molecule or immune stimulant in certain active immunotherapies being developed for a wide range of conditions including cancers, inflammatory disease, immune disorders, and Alzheimer’s.
KLH in TDAR Immunotoxicology

KLH is well known as a safe, potent stimulator of humoral and cellular immune responses. It plays a vital role in research and clinical studies as an antigen for assessing immune function and in immunotoxicology studies such as monitoring the immunosuppressive effects of drug candidates.

About Stellar KLH™ Products


KLH (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin) is used extensively as a carrier protein in research and therapeutic vaccine applications. Peptides, small proteins and drug molecules of low molecular weight are not usually immunogenic. They require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate antibody production. KLH is a very effective and popular carrier protein due to its large size, numerous epitopes, plentiful sites for antigen conjugation, and strong safety history.
KLH is also well known as a safe, potent stimulator of humoral and cellular immune responses.
It plays a vital role in research and clinical studies as an antigen for assessing immune function and in immunotoxicology studies such as monitoring the immunosuppressive effects of drug candidates.
Different forms and supply sources of KLH have been associated with differing magnitudes and variability in IgM and IgG responses.1,2,3 Stellar KLH™ has been shown to produce more robust primary and secondary anti-KLH responses compared to other sources of KLH.3,4 Consistent, reliable responses are critical for proper immunotoxicology testing.
To satisfy the exacting requirements of our vaccine customers, Stellar offers KLH manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). We also offer research grade (non-GMP) product in for use in research and preclinical settings.
Advantages of Stellar KLH™
The quality of KLH can effect conjugation and immune response. Only Stellar KLH™ protein is produced from controlled, land-based aquaculture colonies of Megathura crenulata using Stellar Biotechnologies’ industry-leading manufacturing processes and quality systems. We provide quality, consistent KLH with optimum immunogenicity for both your clinical and research needs.

Consistent, high quality, immunogenic KLH
Low levels of endotoxin and other impurities
Available in both single dose vials and bulk packaging
Fully traceable and controlled back to native source
Long-term, scalable supply for commercial use
Always in liquid form (never lyophilized which can diminish performance)
Produced using environmentally sound, sustainable methods

Over the years, we have pioneered numerous milestones in KLH manufacturing, quality and sustainability. Other KLH suppliers continue to rely on the small and sensitive, wild populations of the Giant Keyhole Limpet and cannot offer KLH that meets Stellar Biotechnologies’ standards.
KLH Structure
Stellar Subunit KLH (suKLH) consists of dissociated KLH subunits of approximately 400-600 kDa. Stellar High Molecular Weight (HMW) KLH consists of KLH in its native form, a didecamer of 4-8 MDa.
