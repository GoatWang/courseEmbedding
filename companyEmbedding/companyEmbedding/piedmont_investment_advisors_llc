					Our Investment Process 	
									












 Active Equity 
To deliver on our objective of maximizing return per unit of risk, we don’t rely on just a single source of insight; rather, we have built a three-part equity investment process that extracts value from the combination of three investment disciplines: 

Quantitative
We begin with reliable idea generation from our cross-sectional and industry specific quantitative models and robust fundamental industry reviews. These outputs give us a detailed view of stocks’ underlying characteristics and behavior.
Fundamental
We research and identify improving fundamentals in names poised for significant and sustainable positive change. We vet the best ideas coming from our quantitative models by conducting deep industry reviews, focused company specific valuations and insightful bull/bear stress tests.
Macro
We construct the portfolio leveraging macro insights that clarify the risks within the portfolio from multiple vantage points including our own view on economic sectors.

 Passive Equity 
We manage passive or index mandates to ensure that the clients’ objective of gaining broad-based index exposure in a cost effective way are met at the initiation of the portfolio and throughout the investment process. 

 
Portfolio Profile
Portfolios are used to replicate selected indices and achieve benchmark returns with minimal dispersion. The trade-offs between tracking error and transaction costs are carefully monitored to achieve the goal of minimum performance variance from the selected benchmark.
Portfolio Construction
We use a variety of indexing methodologies  for portfolio construction. These include full index replication and optimization. The selection of the methodology is based on an analysis of account size, index names, and liquidity considerations of the benchmark.
Portfolio Monitoring
The focus of portfolio monitoring  throughout the investment process is minimizing cash exposure, managing accrued dividends and corporate actions, and ensuring compliance with client guidelines and restrictions. These result in the minimum variance possible from the selected benchmark.

 Fixed Income 
Piedmont’s Yield Advantage strategies are grounded in the belief that yield is the most reliable tool for generating alpha and optimizing return per unit of risk. The goal of  our philosophy is to deliver long-term results that maximize the contribution of yield to total return, while preserving capital. Typically, this yield advantage is derived through credit, optionality, and other spread products, but can be attained through duration based on the stage of the business cycle.
We also believe that the best way to maximize yield’s return contribution is with an investment process that has multiple levers for success. Consistent with this view, the Yield Advantage process works to extract alpha contributions from three areas: Quantitative idea generation, fundamental credit research, and macro insights. The use of multiple alpha sources diversifies our performance and increases its reliability.
Macro Positioning
Portfolio managers leverage firm-wide macro insights to position portfolio’s duration opportunistically based on:

Yield Curve Shifts/Flattening
Rate forecasts
Non-traditional market inputs
Quantitative Idea Generation
Quantitative modeling generates insights on issuer and sector pricing anomalies including:

Credit Quality
Valuation
Spreads
Fundamental Credit Research
Research analysts conduct fundamental work that forms the foundation for security selection and sector rotations including:

Annual Industry reviews
Quarterly Earnings/Credit reviews
Monthly Portfolio reviews
Weekly Holdings reviews

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.  3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.
