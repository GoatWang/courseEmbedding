OPERATIONS







Overview

True North
The True North mining complex, which Klondex acquired in January of 2016, covers 43,000 hectares and is part of a 400 km2 land package.  It is located approximately 250 kilometers northeast of Winnipeg near the town of Bissett, Manitoba.  True North is an underground mining operation consisting of several underground narrow-vein gold deposits in addition to a modern, fully-permitted modern gold mill capable of processing up to 2,500 tons per day.  This facility will be able to maintain the capacity from True North as well as alternate ore sources. Gold was originally discovered at True North in 1911.  The mine has been in operation intermittently since 1931 and has produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold.  From 2007 until 2015, significant investments were made in the property and approximately 390,000 ounces of gold were produced.  The mine is accessed by a 4,050 foot ‘A-Shaft’ and Klondex has undertaken a project to improve the hoisting speed and efficiency of the shaft.  At the same time, the Company has been improving the track and main haulage systems to meet future production goals.   To date, Klondex has successfully completed two long hole test stopes with bulk sampling (of the 710) expected to commence in July. Additionally, the Company has also begun initial reprocessing of the tailings left behind from the previous operator with positive results.  For 2016, it is expected that between 8,000 to 12,000 ounces will be recovered from the test stope mining and tailings reprocessing.  A mineral resource update is expected in the third quarter of 2016 which will form the basis for the True North mine plan.

Most PopularDon't use Doklam standoff as policy tool to achieve political targets, China tells IndiaPresidential poll sees close to 99% votingChina should 'keep calm' about India's rise: Global TimesHUL beats street estimates; posts 9% rise in Q1 net profitHindustan Unilever (HUL) reported a 9.3 per cent rise in profit after tax at Rs 1,283 crore for the June quarter, compared with Rs 1,175 crore profit estimate by analysts in an ETNow poll. The FMCG major had reported Rs 1,174 crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 9,094 crore, up 4.98 per cent YoY over Rs 8,662 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Volume growth remained flat, the company said in a BSE filing. The company said that sentiment during the quarter was cautious in the run up to GST rollout. It noted that despite high promotional intensity, stock pipelines remained low and varied across categories, channels and geographies. Ebitda margins expanded 160 basis points, the company said. The company was expected not to see GST-related destocking, as severe as witnessed during the demonetisation phase. Analysts noted that while there was no impact on consumer demand during the quarter, destocking by wholesalers was visible. Owing to the fact that the share of wholesale was lower for HUL, the impact was expected to be lesser for HUL against the expectation for many other staple companies. Cost of goods sold fell 75 basis points, while the company maintained advertisement and promotion spends during the quarter. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) helped drive A&amp;P percentage down by 20 bps and other expenses down by 40 bps, the company said. Ebitda for the quarter rose 14 per cent, it said. Transition to GST was swift and smooth starting from day 1, the company said.ITC tanks 15% after GST Council hikes cess on cigarettesCigarette makers were choking in trade, with market leader ITC being hit the worst, its stock falling as much as 15 per cent to Rs 276.90 on the BSE, which reduced its market value to Rs. 3.37 lakh crore, compared to yesterday's closing value of Rs. 3.96 lakh crore. The slump comes on the back of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hiking compensation cess on cigarettes. The hike came into effect from the midnight of Monday and Tuesday. The Sensex tanked as much as 450 points while the Nifty briefly slipped below the 9,800 mark to 9,792.05. Losses in the market were led by ITC, which has the second highest weightage (7.65 per cent) in the broader Nifty. Salt-to-hotels conglomerate ITC's cigarette division contributes nearly two-thirds of the FMCG (fast moving consumer goods sector) major's total revenues. Over 60 per cent of ITC's revenues come from its cigarettes business. Brokerage firm Macquarie said the increase in cess is clearly a negative for ITC. The increase in overall taxes/ higher retail prices would impact cigarette volume and earnings adversely, it said. The compensation cess on cigarettes consists of two components - an ad valorem tax of 5 per cent and another numerical cess on each category of filter and non-filter varieties. While the ad valorem has remained the same, the numerical cess linked to the length of cigarettes was increased by the Council. For non-filter 65 mm cigarettes, the numerical cess has been raised to Rs. 2,076 per 1,000 units; for non-filter 65-70 mm cigarettes it is Rs. 3,668 per 1,000 units. For filter category, 65 mm cigarettes will be charged Rs. 2,076 per 1,000 units, 65-70 mm will be charged Rs. 2,747 per 1,000 units and 70-75 mm will be charged Rs. 3,668 per 1,000 units. For other filter cigarettes the ad valorem has been increased to 36 per cent plus Rs. 4,170 per 1,000 units. Whether cigarette makers will increase prices is currently unclear. However, brokerages believe the companies would have to hike prices in order to protect margins. The increase in cess would bring in Rs 5,000 crore of additional tax revenue which otherwise would have gone to the manufacturers, Jaitley said after the emergency meeting that took place on Monday evening through video conferencing.Read MoreReutersNevadaMidasklondex mines ltdklondex minesNavbharat TimesFeatured Today In TravelFrom our Global PartnersUnited Airlines posts higher passenger unit revenueChipotle shuts Virginia restaurant on norovirus worries, shares fallCarrefour Brasil IPO prices at bottom of range -sourcesThermo Fisher prices offering of euro-denominated senior notes1Klondex Mines says produced 66,629 GEOs in Q22United Airlines posts higher passenger unit revenue3Chipotle shuts Virginia restaurant on norovirus worries, shares fall4Carrefour Brasil IPO prices at bottom of range -sources5Thermo Fisher prices offering of euro-denominated senior notes`

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
