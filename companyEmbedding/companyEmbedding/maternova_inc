Maternova, Inc. Signs Partnership With Microlife Corporation, LLC

							Microlife Corporation, LLC has selected Maternova, Inc. as their partner for introducing their new groundbreaking vital signs system, the Cradle Blood Pressure Cuff. This revolutionary innovation is designed and approved for use on expectant mothers. It can detect several life-threatening conditions including shock. 						


Press Release
-

												Mar 8, 2016						
 





			Providence, RI, 
			March 8, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	 Maternova, Inc , the global public health solutions provider has signed as the exclusive distribution partner for Microlife Corporation’s pathbreaking Vital Signs Alert (VSA).  This newest addition to the Maternova women’s health portfolio is positioned for rapid adoption globally.
“The VSA is the first such device validated in pregnant women and for use in emerging market and low resource settings” Maternova’s CEO Meg Wirth shared. “ We’re pleased to be the commercialization partner for this combination blood pressure and heart rate monitor which has exceeded World Health Organization performance requirements,” Wirth added.
The VSA is a handheld semi-automatic oscillometric device measures vital signs, with a simplified readout based on traffic signal warnings (red, yellow and green lights) for shock and high blood pressure. The device is critical breakthrough to identify shock after hemorrhage and high blood pressure due to preeclampsia or eclampsia.   These conditions are responsible for the majority of maternal deaths globally.
Developed in the United Kingdom, by Professor Andrew Shennan, CRADLE Chief Investigator, Kings College London, the Microlife VSA has undergone extensive field-testing multicenter trials in ten low-income sites, and has been lauded as a true breakthrough for expectant mothers at risk. “We are delighted that we are at last in a position to disseminate the device to the areas that need it. It has been a long journey, and taken more than 10 years to get right. But now the new technology is proven to be effective, popular and robust with the potential to save many lives. We just need to get it to where it's needed and Maternova is the perfect partner to achieve this.” Dr. Shennan added.
Microlife is one of the world leaders in the development and manufacturing of medical diagnostic equipment for home monitoring and institutional use. “We are very proud about the newly developed VSA Device and the positive feedback and enthusiasm we received from health professionals working for the Cradle Projects.  We deeply hope and believe that with this device we can improve maternal care and reduce maternal deaths in low and middle-income countries” added Mr. A. Moll, Sales Microlife.
Maternova, Inc. is a company specializing in distribution of obstetric and neonatal innovations and solutions for emerging markets. 
The Vital Signs Alert device will be available as either an individual product, and as part of  Maternova Inc.’s new solution kits for Postpartum Hemorrhage and Safe Delivery. To learn more about the VSA and for efficient ordering, please email orders@maternova.net or also visit online to learn more at this Matrenova Cradle VSA link or the Maternova site.

Maternova, Inc. and Goal Zero Partner to Offer Innovative Power and Lighting Solutions in Medical Markets Worldwide


Press Release
-

												Jun 14, 2016						
 





			Providence, Rhode Island, 
			June 14, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​Maternova, Inc. is pleased to announce the addition of Goal Zero portable power and lighting products to their growing portfolio of solutions for emerging markets and low resource healthcare settings. This new line of solar and hand cranked lighting and power solutions enable life-saving electronic medical devices to now be used without fluctuating grid power, in hospitals, clinics and humanitarian settings. 
High quality portable power products ensure that USB rechargeable medical devices like the Microlife CRADLE Vital Signs Monitor, available from Maternova, are charged and ready to use in any care setting regardless of the availability of grid power. 
Goal Zero is the leading manufacturer of portable solar power and hand-cranked lighting products. The company has made its mark supplying innovative power and lighting solutions for the outdoor sports and camping industry.  Partnering with Goal Zero, Maternova can now provide a power source and charging station for USB rechargeable medical devices, tablets, and cell phones.

Our mission is to provide the lighting and power to the over one third of global clinics and hospitals lacking basic power capabilities. 


				Allyson Cote,
		Maternova, Inc. CoFounder and COO		
		
	


Maternova developed a power and lighting solution with Goal Zero after conducting a needs survey of its network of care providers around the world. "The results were a clear indication that many rural clinics and hospitals were operating with intermittent or no power for the care they provide," explains Meg Wirth, CEO of Maternova. Wirth adds that, "Goal Zero is an exciting partner for Maternova, enabling us to deliver best-in-class products for healthcare providers working where the lack of power and lighting can directly impact the quality of life-saving care provided.  With this solution we can now change that. "
"Our partnership with Maternova allows us to support those who are saving lives," said Bill Harmon, general manager of Goal Zero. "Hospitals, clinics, and community health workers can depend on our products to deliver the power and lighting solutions they need wherever they are working.  Goal Zero started as a way to improve the lives of villagers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and through our partnership with Maternova, we know our products are still making a positive difference in the world."   
About Goal Zero 
Goal Zero is the industry leader in renewable, portable power. From phones to fridges and everything in between, our solar panels, rechargers and accessories give you the power to go farther, regardless of your gears' battery life. We were born out of the desire to empower people everywhere, and as an NRG company we're working to change the way people think about and use power by pioneering the development of smarter energy choices. Power. Anything. Anywhere. For more information, visit www.GoalZero.com

First NovaVeil Manufacturing Run Underway!


Maternova's first manufacturing run of the NovaVeil line is now underway.  Designed by Brazilian-born Alessandra Gold, the NovaVeil line was funded through equity crowdfunding on Republic.
As mosquito and tick season unfold, women will be empowered with beautiful clothes that repel vector borne illness.  Invisible, but powerful nanotechnology infused textiles allow women to move through their day with ease and free from insect bites.
The NovaVeil line will be sold in Europe and Brazil to start with the U.S. following close behind.  Please spread the word.

First prototypes of Novaveil line highly rated by early adopters 


The initial prototypes of Novaveil anti-mosquito maternity wear were distributed in El Salvador with our partner, Americares.  Over the last five months, pregnant women worked with health care workers to provide detailed feedback on the look and feel of the garments.  The consensus?  The idea of protective apparel as a novel layer of protection against Zika during pregnancy is extremely well-received in the community!  We will keep you posted.

Highlights:
Stylish apparel line that protects from Zika and other viruses Made of innovative fabric with nanotechnology Globally known brand for expertise in maternal and newborn healthEstablished cash flow-positive business​As seen in:​The world is not safe for womenInsect borne illnesses: Zika, Lyme, malaria, dengue, Chikungunya, etc., pose serious health threats for moms and babies. They spread quickly across the US and Latin America and trigger public health alerts.​Among significantly affected countries are USA, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and over 100 more.​ The effects of these viruses can be quite severe for pregnant women and their babies, with microcephaly as one consequence of Zika.
Current preventive solutions like mosquito repellents have proven to be ineffective. Research by our partner clinic in El Salvador (run by Americares) has documented that women avoid wearing skin based repellents because they smell bad and are expensive. 
Our study found that only 89% of women are not comfortable applying repellent directly to their skin. Vaccines, bed nets, community spraying and mosquito traps are not enough.
Women need an inexpensive way to protect themselves from Zika as they move about during the day. ​This is especially critical for countries without a sophisticated medical system. 
Introducing NovaVeil – a line of protective apparel by Maternova, incorporating stylish design and nanotechnology​A labor of love between Maternova, Inc. and a renowned Brazilian designer Alessandra Gold, NovaVeil is the first line of stylish protective apparel that allows women to feel empowered and confident, knowing that they are protecting themselves beautifully.​NovaVeil is using a patented nanotechnology-enhanced textile that repels the mosquitoes that carry viruses, This textile allows us to manufacture stylish but affordable garments that women can wear during the day to protect themselves against the Zika virus.​​NovaVeil line:​​We use the world's best scientific minds alongside the ideal creative partner to develop original and innovative solutions. 
Each detail is crafted specifically for impacted climates and consider the habits of the mosquitoes – they bite in the day and they especially like dark colors – so the designs feature a lighter calming palette.Maternity dress
First ever dress designed to appeal across cultures, expand to fit a growing belly and imbued with nanotech repellent
Thoughtfully constructed for women of all sizes and heightsInterior dress comes with simple cinching ties Ruched hem adjusters for full or mid length options
Cardigan 
lightweight elongated cardiganincludes a hood to protect the head and hair sleeves that extend over most of the hand for maximum coverage and protection. 
Scarf
Lightweight breathable scarfable to cover the head or the lap can cover an infant bassinet or an infant nursing with mother 
Leggings
Light colored leggingsProtect the lower half of the body and ankles, an area of particular interest to the virus carrying mosquitos.​​​​Chemicals used by pregnant women must be safe for the mother and for the fetus. NovaVeil is protecting women using a special fabric that does not result in the absorption of repellent chemicals into the skin.​
The Environmental Protection Agency reviews clinical and environmental data to ensure consumer protection. By using a chemical already approved by the EPA we 1) ensure that it is safe and 2) save years of approval and testing.
​By ensuring a long life for a maternity garment and other pieces, we bring down the average cost per day of protection significantly.
​
According to studies, skin-based repellents are avoided because of odor. By providing an odorless solution in the form of apparel, we increase the chances that women will use it and be protected.​​​

Skin-based repellents are a hassle and are quite costly. NovaVeil makes protection from mosquitos effortless – wearing clothing is easier than applying repellent every few hours.​
Mosquitos in some countries, including Puerto Rico, have evolved to be able to resist permethrin – this widely recommended insecticide is simply not effective in many areas. 
​Nanotechnology processes allow the insect repellent to be bound to textile fibers at the molecular level. It is this process which gives the textile its long life through many washings.
A patented technology enables us to offer something that is exclusively our own. It can not be copied and allows us, with our partners, to maintain quality control. 
And.. stylish.
Maternova considers style as a part of dignity. Women should be able to protect themselves and their babies while still looking stunning.
We’ve partnered with Alessandra Gold - the fashion designer behind the NovaVeil line.​Born in Brazil and headquartered in Miami, Alessandra knows how to design for women and is 100% committed to creative approaches to protecting women.
trained at Fashion Institute of Technology, New Yorknamed as this year's top 10 Miami designernamed one of 8 Latin American designers to watch by Glamour magazinedesigns featured in Sports Illustrated, Nylon, and Vogue​​Solution for the whole world
Retail line for established markets
We will sell the NovaVeil line at retail prices so that higher-income women have access to stylish apparel that protects against Zika. Doctors and midwives will sell products through their clinics, governments will buy product in bulk, and individuals will buy retail so that the average woman in Europe, the U.S. and Brazil can be protected. 
Subsidized line for lower-income women at risk
Part of the proceeds from the retail line will be used to subsidize a line of protective apparel for low-income women in the countries hardest hit by viruses. Humanitarian organizations will be able to purchase in bulk for distribution for displaced populations at risk of mosquito borne illness.​​About Maternova, Inc. 
Maternova, Inc is a globally recognized women’s health solutions company. We’re the purveyors of hope and innovation: our mission is to improve the quality of life for women and newborns everywhere by accelerating access to life-saving technologies.

FAQ






What is Maternova?



What is Maternova?

Maternova is the first e-commerce platform focused on accelerating innovative products in the $20B maternal/newborn health industry, revolutionizing the way life-saving global health products are discovered, accessed and distributed. We offer branded and private label disruptive technologies to organizations equipping global health workers through a unique distribution network of governments, distributors and NGOs 




Who are your customers?



Who are your customers?



Our customers include governments, the United Nations, national ministries of health, leading humanitarian organizations, private hospitals, research institutions and schools for health professionals. We work through all avenues to reach the most vulnerable women globally. 




Why is Maternova needed?



Why is Maternova needed?

According to the World Health Organization, 800 women die every day during childbirth, with 99 percent of those deaths taking place in the developing world. There are medical tools, often times inexpensive ones, that make a drastic difference in these outcomes.However, these tools can be difficult to obtain and ship, and this is exactly where we have made—and continue to make—inspirational strides.




What is your impact?



What is your impact?

To date, we have distributed products in more than 40 countries, and we have helped save the lives of over 200,000 women and children. 




How did Maternova start and then evolve?



How did Maternova start and then evolve?

Maternova was originally an educational resource for global public health workers. We created our highly acclaimed “Innovation Index” and began cataloging innovations in various stages of development from all over the world. It was our hope and ultimate goal to speed the dissemination of information across all the barriers that exist. That initial plan proved wildly successful, and inquiries started flooding in from countries all over the world asking how the devices could be obtained.  
We quickly realized, though, that simply distributing the products wasn’t enough. We had to accomplish two important goals. The rigorous field testing of products to ensure they performed as described and met our criteria was essential. Maternova is extremely lucky to have not only two wonderful boards in place but we also have some fantastic in-country distributors in places like Nigeria, DRC, Cameroon, and many more who are so gracious in their commitment to our mission they test each product we sell at length. Our testing in-office of innovations has often provided some hilarious moments of comic relief as well. It’s true that some things just never go as planned, and we’re OK with that!
Lastly, we wanted to develop a more comprehensive suite of products for people. It’s not enough to only offer one or two items. Our customers often order four-plus products with each visit to our marketplace. It’s our hope to provide the most effective solutions for the birth experience that don’t always mean just the moment of birth.




How do you source technologies?



How do you source technologies?

We began by researching journals and R&D labs.  Now we are lucky enough that many entrepreneurs and teams come to us to see if we can help commercialize their ideas.We have a screening tool to determine whether technologies are a good fit for our key markets--we start with the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for women (and newborns)




Do you have any intellectual property?



Do you have any intellectual property?

We see a lot of gaps in current solutions.  For that reason we do have one provisional patent and we are working on others.

What customer problem do you solve?



What customer problem do you solve?

The global health marketplace is fragmented and opaque. Customers (those who procure health technologies) do not have a trusted source where they can both find out about technologies appropriate to their settings and purchase products with confidence. The result is that key channels are simply unaware of the existence of game-changing technologies and/or unable to figure out how to purchase them. Maternova fills this glaring gap.




What is your competitive advantage?



What is your competitive advantage?

Maternova Inc. has first mover advantage with its first to market platform play in the global health space.  With hundreds of customers in over 40 countries we have strong partnerships and exclusive distribution agreements with both suppliers and sub-distributors.  Our branded bundles, kits and soon--proprietary biotech offerings place us as a pioneer in this space.




But what customer problem do you solve specific to Zika?



But what customer problem do you solve specific to Zika?

Public health authorities have a number of tools in their arsenal against Zika:  sprays, repellents, bednets, condoms and traps. But there is no viable protective apparel that women can wear as they go about their day.  We are going to change that.

Risks








We depend on third-party service providers and outsource providers for a variety of services and we outsource a number of our non-core functions and operations.

In certain instances, we rely on single or limited service providers and outsourcing vendors because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, or lack of alternative sources. If production or service was interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third-party providers, we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If outsourcing services are interrupted or not performed or the performance is poor, this could impact our ability to process, record and report transactions with our customers and other constituents. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could result in our inability to meet customer demand, damage our reputation and customer relationships and adversely affect our business.



We depend on third party providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services.

We obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.



Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of the products we source, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events.

These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by governmental authorities) and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. Similarly, negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events.



An intentional or unintentional disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems could severely affect our business.

Such an event might be caused by computer hacking, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, “cyber-attacks” and other malicious activity, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant, equipment and data. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential customer data or intellectual property. Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. Moreover, these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers.



Our global operations are required to comply with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with US and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws.

If we fail to comply with them, we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions.



We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons with whom we contract.

In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.



The Company’s success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors, its executive officers and key employees.

In particular, the Company is dependent on Allyson E. Cote and Margaret E. Wirth, Co-founders of the Company. The Company has or intends to enter into employment agreements with Allyson E Cote and Margaret E. Wirth although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that they will continue to be employed by the Company for a particular period of time. The loss of Allyson E. Cote and Margaret E. Wirth or any member of the board of directors or executive officer could harm the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.



Although dependent on certain key personnel, the Company does not have any key man life insurance policies on both key persons.

The Company is dependent on Allyson E. Cote and Margaret E. Wirth in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan, however, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to one of these individuals in the event of their death or disability. Therefore, if Allyson E. Cote die or become disabled, the Company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person’s absence. The loss of such person could negatively affect the Company and its operations.



The development and commercialization of our products are moderately competitive.

We face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Our competitors include other startup companies worldwide. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in research and development and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize products.



The Company has indicated that it has engaged in certain transactions with related persons, in the case of a small loan from ‘friends and family’ at the early stages of the company formation.

Please see the section of this Memorandum entitled “Transactions with Related Persons and Conflicts of Interest” for further details.



Changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.

Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, healthcare reform and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements, union membership and sales taxes. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, mandated training for employees, increased tax reporting and tax payment changing regulations from the National Labor Relations Board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act.



The Health Care Reform Law

The 3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers which began in 2013 may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.For example, (i) where we purchase medical devices from third-party manufacturers, the manufacturers may increase their prices to cover their payment of the excise tax and our costs to purchase such medical devices may therefore increase and (ii) where we manufacture medical devices or are the importer of record, our cost of goods sold have increased because we are subject to paying the excise tax.



The healthcare industry is highly regulated.

We are subject to regulation in the US at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries. In addition, the US federal and state governments have allocated greater resources to the enforcement of these laws. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we failed to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.



A sizable proportion of the products that we manufacture, source, distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements.

To lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to hold permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals from, and to comply with operating and security standards of, governmental bodies. Failure to maintain or renew necessary permits, licenses or approvals, or noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute, import or manufacture products, product recalls or seizures, or criminal and civil sanctions and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of the products we source are subject to extensive regulation and increased scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nigeria and South

Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.



The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies.

Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission.



Part of our business model does rely on third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products outside the United States.

We depend, in part, on medical device distributors for the marketing and selling of our products in foreign countries. We depend on these distributors’ efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. These distributors typically sell a variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling our products. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer. Recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offerings require significant time and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors. Further, if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates, we may be unable to replace that distributor without disruption to our business. If we fail to maintain relationships with our distributors, fail to develop new relationships with other distributors, including in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing distributors effectively, or fail to provide distributors with competitive products on attractive terms, or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results, reputation and business may be harmed.



The design, manufacture and marketing of the medical devices we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims.

Manufacturing and marketing of the commercial products we source, and clinical testing of our products under development, may expose us to product liability and other tort claims. Although we have, and intend to maintain, liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products which we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any costs (the material components of which are settlements, judgments, legal fees and other related defense costs) not covered under our previously issued product liability insurance policies and existing reserves could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, product liability claims could negatively affect our reputation, continued product sales, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products.



If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products, our revenues will be negatively impacted.

Our success in marketing our products depends in large part on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of our products. In the United States, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for our products does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be obtained. Further, one third-party payor’s decision to cover our products does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the products or provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.
