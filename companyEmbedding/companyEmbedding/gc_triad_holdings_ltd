Character Profile


		Many moons ago in Dunesfolk... On the 16th Sun of the 1st Umbral Moon... A withered lalafell gave birth to a fatherless son... The townsfolk frowned upon her and cast her out... Stoned and beaten she protected the life she bore... She never scream... She never cried... she knew the truth... In a dream... A premonition... The life she would bare would cost her more than she could afford... That night... The sky poured when her life flickered away like embers of a flame... In a frayed letter... In her last words..."He was born from love but he shall be my End...  May the builder watch over his cub"

-2Triple triad: duty drop system[Triple][Triad][drop][rng][oh the humanity...]Public 





			I have yet to try and run a duty to collect triple triad cards.  How does it work anyone know?  Is it a chest?  Is it an special monster needed to be killed?  How is the drop rate? If anyone has attempted to farm cards for this I'd love to know.  Thank you in advancePs: waiting for a "red" cards :)

Bruker Completes Divestiture of its Gas Chromatography Product Lines


11/03/2014

Download this Press Release ()

FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fourth paragraph, fourth sentence of release should read: Bruker will
continue to service and support its GC-TQ and LC-TQ products
indefinitely. (instead of Bruker will continue to service and support
its GC-TQ and LC-TQ products unless Techcomp exercises its option to
acquire the services business in the next twelve months.).


The corrected release reads:

BRUKER COMPLETES DIVESTITURE OF ITS GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY PRODUCT LINES
Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ: BRKR) today announced that it completed the
divestiture of its Gas Chromatography (GC) and GC single-quadrupole
(GC-SQ) mass spectrometry products to Techcomp Europe Ltd., a subsidiary
of Techcomp (Holdings) Ltd, on October 31st, 2014. Techcomp
intends to continue to manufacture the former Bruker GC and GC-SQ SCION™
products in the Fremont, CA, factory previously occupied by Bruker’s
Chemical and Applied Markets (CAM) division.


Select Bruker CAM GC and GC-SQ sales, marketing, applications and
operations employees are expected to be offered positions with Techcomp.
Bruker will continue to provide service and support for all GC and GC-SQ
products worldwide. As part of the transaction, Techcomp has a deferred
option to acquire the service business for GC and GC-SQ products in the
next twelve months.


The GC product line divestiture is an important part of Bruker’s
restructuring of its CAM division, which was announced in July 2014. In
September 2014, Bruker’s CAM division divested its Inductively-Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) product line and service business to
Analytik Jena AG.


Additionally, Bruker is also in the process of relocating the
manufacturing of its GC triple-quadrupole and LC triple-quadrupole
(GC-TQ and LC-TQ) mass spectrometers from Fremont, CA to Bremen,
Germany. This relocation is expected to be finalized in the first half
of 2015. Bruker’s GC-TQ and LC-TQ product research and development will
be transferred to the Company’s major mass spectrometry sites in Bremen
and Billerica, MA.Bruker will continue to service and support its GC-TQ
and LC-TQ products indefinitely.
