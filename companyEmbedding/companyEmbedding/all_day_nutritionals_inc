FAQ's



How much do I drink per serving?
We recommend a serving size of 2.5oz (74ml). Each Nutri-tite box contains a free 2.5oz plastic serving glass so you get the perfect serving every time! 
How many calories per serving and sugar count?
Each 2.5oz serving only contains 3g of natural sweeteners and 10 calories. We use a small amount of natural cane sugar combined with stevia to enhance the flavor.

Are there any preservatives?
No, the Vitamin and Immunity formulas are free of preservatives and artificial ingredients. They are also gluten-free, caffeine-free, dairy-free, and gmo-free.

What are the natural flavors?
Immunity / Citrus - is a combination of natural strawberry and grapefruit flavors.
Vitamin / Mango - is a combination of natural peach and mango flavors.

What are the Natural sweeteners?
Natural cane sugar combined with stevia to enhance the flavor.

Can children use the Vitamin or Immunity products?
We advise that you consult a medical professional. Most doctors will advise that children under between the ages of 6 -12 years old only drink 1.5 ounces. We do not recommend for children under the age of 6. Our Kids formulas are currently in development.

I am pregnant or breastfeeding, can I use your products?
We advise that you consult a medical professional. Most doctors will advise that you should not drink the Immunity formula because of the herbal blend. 
The Vitamin formula contains no herbal ingredients.

What is the difference between the Vitamin and Immunity products?
Immunity is a year-round daily supplement containing 7 core vitamins and minerals plus a proprietary herbal blend to help maintain a healthy immune system. 
Vitamin is a daily multi-vitamin containing 17 vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, B6, and B12.
What is ginseng and astragalus?
Ginseng - is believed to provide the body with a boost of energy, lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and reduce stress.
Astragalus - the main property of this herb is to boost the body's immune system.
 
Can I take both formulas in one day or take any formula more than once a day?
We suggest a period of 4 - 8 hours between servings to allow the body time to absorb the ingredients.
 
Should I take on an empty stomach or with food?
Either way is fine. We suggest an empty stomach but you can
 

What if I drink more than 2.5oz?
We suggest you do not drink more than three 2.5oz servings each day or more than 4 ounces in one serving. Your body can only absord a certain amount of ingredients at one time. If you do experience any sudden side effects contact your doctor.
Do I need to keep in the fridge?
No, you can leave the Nutri-tite box safely at room temperature. The Nutri-tite spout and bag are always sealed and prevent exposure to oxygen and outside elements - protecting ingredients from oxidization. We do recommend storing in the fridge for a chilled and refreshing taste every time. 
What is the shelf life of your products?
Each Nutri-tite box contains 40 daily servings and is stamped with a best before date which is 18 months after production. After opening, we suggest using the product within 120 days.
Does All Day Nutritionals Inc. do fundraising?
We suggest you contact info@alldaynutritionals.com and learn how your team, group or organization can use our products to raise funds on a regular basis.

Cat: 
				a few months ago			




				From the eco style packaging, to the actual product, this is high quality. Everything is conveniently packed into one nice box. The spout pours perfectly and I really like how the seal is easy to remove. As for the actual product... wow! The amount of vitamin C is pretty epic. I've noticed a surge in energy for sure possibly related to the ginseng. Great product all around.
