Early career and government service[edit]
Moskow began his career teaching economics, labor relations, and management at Temple University, Lafayette College, and Drexel University. From 1969 to 1977, he held a number of senior positions in the federal government, including Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor, director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability, Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and senior staff economist with the Council of Economic Advisers.
Professional leadership and public service[edit]
In 1977, Moskow joined the private sector at Esmark in Chicago and later held senior management positions at Northwest Industries, Dart & Kraft, and Premark International. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush appointed Moskow Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, with the corresponding rank of Ambassador. In this role, he was responsible for trade negotiations with Japan, China, and Southeast Asian countries, as well as oversight of industries such as steel, semiconductors, and aircraft. Moskow returned to academia in 1993, joining the faculty of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he was professor of strategy and international management at the time of his appointment as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Nonprofit and civic leadership[edit]
Moskow is active in numerous professional and civic organizations. He is chairman of the Japan America Society of Chicago, former chairman of the Economic Club of Chicago, and serves as a director of World Business Chicago. He is a board member and former chairman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, and a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. Moskow is also an emeritus trustee of Lafayette College.
Corporate board memberships[edit]
Since leaving his position at the Federal Reserve, Moskow joined the boards of directors of Discover Financial Services, Commonwealth Edison (a subsidiary of Exelon), the National Futures Association, Northern Funds (2008-2013), Taylor Capital Group (2008-2014), and Diamond Management & Technology Consultants (2008-2010). He is a member of the advisory boards to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Edgewater Funds, and Promontory Financial Group.[3]
Family life and education[edit]
Moskow was born in Paterson, New Jersey. He received an A.B. in economics from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, and a Ph.D. in business and applied economics from the University of Pennsylvania. He has received honorary doctoral degrees from DePaul University, Dominican University, Lafayette College, and Lewis University. Moskow is married to Suzanne Kopp-Moskow.[4] He has three children from a previous marriage and seven grandchildren.

                           Interviews were held with superintendents and teachers in a selected sample of 16 school districts, drwn from a nationwide
                              list of 108 districts with histories of collective negotiations, to study the viability of collective bargaining at the local
                              level as a means for determining wages and working conditions of public school teachers. Because of its economic structure
                              and administration, legal aspects, labor market, and teacher organizations, the environment of public education was regarded
                              as unique for the development of collective bargaining. Six common features of collective bargaining were found to be particularly
                              related to public education--exclusive recognition, appropriate bargaining unit, joint decisionmaking, bargaining power, scope
                              of bargaining, and the written agreement. These six features were studied with respect to (1) reasons for development of the
                              feature in the private sector, (2) functional appropriateness in public education, (3) current utilization in public education,
                              and (4) degree of modification necessary for viability in the public educational environment. The study concluded that a modified
                              form of local-level collective bargaining is viable in public education. No significant difference was found in the practical
                              impact of nea and aft approaches. This document is published by industrial research unit, wharton school of finance and commerce,

                           Interviews were held with superintendents and teachers in a selected sample of 16 school districts, drwn from a nationwide
                              list of 108 districts with histories of collective negotiations, to study the viability of collective bargaining at the local
                              level as a means for determining wages and working conditions of public school teachers. Because of its economic structure
                              and administration, legal aspects, labor market, and teacher organizations, the environment of public education was regarded
                              as unique for the development of collective bargaining. Six common features of collective bargaining were found to be particularly
                              related to public education--exclusive recognition, appropriate bargaining unit, joint decisionmaking, bargaining power, scope
                              of bargaining, and the written agreement. These six features were studied with respect to (1) reasons for development of the
                              feature in the private sector, (2) functional appropriateness in public education, (3) current utilization in public education,
                              and (4) degree of modification necessary for viability in the public educational environment. The study concluded that a modified
                              form of local-level collective bargaining is viable in public education. No significant difference was found in the practical
                              impact of nea and aft approaches. This document is published by industrial research unit, wharton school of finance and commerce,

Article excerpt

  When we think of the state of the world economy over the last 20 years, what we see is a mixture of the good, the bad, and the puzzling. On the one hand, we in the U.S. have experienced the longest period of uninterrupted growth in our history. We've actually had an extraordinary 17-year run, interrupted only by the rather short recession of 1990-91. On the other hand, this period has also been characterized by financial turmoil.    Worldwide, this period has seen the greatest concentration of financial crises since the 1930s. In the U.S., the cost of resolving the savings and loan crisis amounted to around 3 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP). [1] Yet this cost was dwarfed by crises in Scandinavia, Latin America, and, most recently, East Asia. Estimates of resolution costs for the Asian crisis countries are between 20 percent and 65 percent of GDP. [2] And there are still rumblings of concern in certain markets. For example, the Japanese banking system is generally regarded as undercapitalized, with official reported bad loans amounting to over 6 percent of total loans. The true volume of bad loans may be quite a bit higher. [3] Most observers would agree that financial disruptions of these magnitudes have substantial welfare costs. [4]    I'd like to focus on a particular manifestation of this problem: the so-called twin-crisis phenomenon, where banking crises go hand-in-hand with currency crises in emerging economies. We saw this in Mexico in 1995, in East Asia in 1997, and in Russia in 1998.    This new development is part of a broader phenomenon that creates both opportunities and dangers: the rapid globalization of financial markets. This explosion in cross-border financial transactions resulted from a confluence of economic, political, and technological factors. The rapid export-led growth of developing free market economies, notably the Asian tigers, especially by comparison to the relative lackluster performance of many state-controlled economies, has dramatized the potential gains from decentralization, deregulation, and reduction in restrictions on free movement of goods and capital. Technological developments have increased the ease and speed with which large volume cross-border transactions can be executed.    The great opportunity from globalization is that standards of living worldwide can grow as more and more countries exploit the gains from trade, and as capital flows to its most productive uses. The great danger is that globalization may carry with it new sources of financial instability and may exacerbate financial disruptions when they do occur. So I've briefly discussed the good and the bad--now the puzzle: "How should we respond to these challenges?"    This issue is of particular concern to the Federal Reserve System. The long-run goal of the Federal Reserve is to promote maximum sustainable growth through price stability. However, the Federal Reserve is also committed to safeguarding the safety and soundness of the financial system. The approaches we have used in the past are designed mainly for national financial systems. Now, I believe, is the appropriate time to consider whether these approaches are adequate in an environment where national borders are less and less important. In light of recent developments, how should we proceed?    A good place to start is with a discussion of the twin-crisis phenomenon: where a banking crisis and a currency crisis occur simultaneously and feed on each other. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this phenomenon is the Asian crisis of 1997. What happened? Why did these countries get hit by a sudden crisis so strong that it engendered output declines on the order of the Great Depression? [5]    First, let's rule out one candidate explanation. The crisis was not the result of poor macroeconomic policies. In fact, the crisis countries pursued rather conservative policies. Their economies were characterized by low inflation, budgets generally in surplus, and declining government foreign debt. …
