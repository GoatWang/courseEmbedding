History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of the brake hose manufacturing business in Dayton, Ohio to Harco Manufacturing Group, announced in January 2007.[18]
The settlement of a social plan in the "Concurso," or Spanish insolvency proceeding, of Delphi Automotive Systems Espana S.L.
The sale of the Mexican brake components business, including a manufacturing plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, to Robert Bosch LLC and its affiliate Frenados Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V., announced in June 2007.[19]
The sale of substantially all of the assets of MobileAria, Inc. to Wireless Matrix USA, Inc.
The sale of the U.S. Battery operations in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2006.[20]
The wind-down of a Delphi Medical Texas facility in Houston, Texas
The consolidation of fuel injector production in Rochester, New York during 2006-2007, which allowed the Debtors to wind down a manufacturing facility in Coopersville, Michigan
The sale of the catalyst business to Umicore, completed in October, 2007.[21]
The sale of the Wheel bearings business based in Sandusky, Ohio to Kyklos, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hephaestus Holdings, Inc., in February 2008.[22]
The sale of the Interiors and Closures business was announced in October, 2007, to Renco Group. This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]
Sale of global suspension and brakes business ("Global Ride Dynamics") to BeijingWest announced 31 March 2009.[26] BWI Group commenced 1 November 2009.

Operations[edit]
As of November 2015[update], Delphi has four diversified business segments:[2]

"Electrical/Electronic Architecture" provides complete vehicle electrical systems, integrating wiring and cable assemblies, electrical centers and connection systems.
"Electronics & Safety" provides components, systems and software for both passive and active safety, security, comfort and infotainment, as well as other vehicular electronic controls.
"Powertrain Systems" provides integrated gasoline and diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, valve train fuel injection, combustion controls, electronics, and a complete line of aftermarket products and services. 3 May 2017, Spin off announced for Powertrain
"Product & Service Solutions" provides auto parts from OE divisions and OE competitors for the aftermarket.

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

EnerDel – started as a joint venture of Ener1 and Delphi. In August 2008, Ener1 bought exclusive ownership of EnerDel.[29]
Condumex – A Grupo Carso division

Senior management[edit]
On 4 November 2009, Delphi named a new board[30] with John A. Krol as the chairman. Kevin P. Clark has been the President and chief executive officer of the company[31] since March 2015.
Environmental record[edit]

History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of the brake hose manufacturing business in Dayton, Ohio to Harco Manufacturing Group, announced in January 2007.[18]
The settlement of a social plan in the "Concurso," or Spanish insolvency proceeding, of Delphi Automotive Systems Espana S.L.
The sale of the Mexican brake components business, including a manufacturing plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, to Robert Bosch LLC and its affiliate Frenados Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V., announced in June 2007.[19]
The sale of substantially all of the assets of MobileAria, Inc. to Wireless Matrix USA, Inc.
The sale of the U.S. Battery operations in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2006.[20]
The wind-down of a Delphi Medical Texas facility in Houston, Texas
The consolidation of fuel injector production in Rochester, New York during 2006-2007, which allowed the Debtors to wind down a manufacturing facility in Coopersville, Michigan
The sale of the catalyst business to Umicore, completed in October, 2007.[21]
The sale of the Wheel bearings business based in Sandusky, Ohio to Kyklos, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hephaestus Holdings, Inc., in February 2008.[22]
The sale of the Interiors and Closures business was announced in October, 2007, to Renco Group. This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]
Sale of global suspension and brakes business ("Global Ride Dynamics") to BeijingWest announced 31 March 2009.[26] BWI Group commenced 1 November 2009.

Operations[edit]
As of November 2015[update], Delphi has four diversified business segments:[2]

"Electrical/Electronic Architecture" provides complete vehicle electrical systems, integrating wiring and cable assemblies, electrical centers and connection systems.
"Electronics & Safety" provides components, systems and software for both passive and active safety, security, comfort and infotainment, as well as other vehicular electronic controls.
"Powertrain Systems" provides integrated gasoline and diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, valve train fuel injection, combustion controls, electronics, and a complete line of aftermarket products and services. 3 May 2017, Spin off announced for Powertrain
"Product & Service Solutions" provides auto parts from OE divisions and OE competitors for the aftermarket.

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

EnerDel – started as a joint venture of Ener1 and Delphi. In August 2008, Ener1 bought exclusive ownership of EnerDel.[29]
Condumex – A Grupo Carso division

Senior management[edit]
On 4 November 2009, Delphi named a new board[30] with John A. Krol as the chairman. Kevin P. Clark has been the President and chief executive officer of the company[31] since March 2015.
Environmental record[edit]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Delphi corp. as the 21st-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States in 2002.[32] According to the study, the manufacturer's most toxic emissions included asbestos (542 lb/yr), chromium compounds (1,082 lb/yr), lead compounds (8,466 lb/yr), and sulfuric acid (17,600 lbs/year), while the most massive emissions were glycol ethers (111,520 lbs/year) and hydrochloric acid (80,000 lb/yr).[33]

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of the brake hose manufacturing business in Dayton, Ohio to Harco Manufacturing Group, announced in January 2007.[18]
The settlement of a social plan in the "Concurso," or Spanish insolvency proceeding, of Delphi Automotive Systems Espana S.L.
The sale of the Mexican brake components business, including a manufacturing plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, to Robert Bosch LLC and its affiliate Frenados Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V., announced in June 2007.[19]
The sale of substantially all of the assets of MobileAria, Inc. to Wireless Matrix USA, Inc.
The sale of the U.S. Battery operations in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2006.[20]
The wind-down of a Delphi Medical Texas facility in Houston, Texas
The consolidation of fuel injector production in Rochester, New York during 2006-2007, which allowed the Debtors to wind down a manufacturing facility in Coopersville, Michigan
The sale of the catalyst business to Umicore, completed in October, 2007.[21]
The sale of the Wheel bearings business based in Sandusky, Ohio to Kyklos, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hephaestus Holdings, Inc., in February 2008.[22]
The sale of the Interiors and Closures business was announced in October, 2007, to Renco Group. This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]
Sale of global suspension and brakes business ("Global Ride Dynamics") to BeijingWest announced 31 March 2009.[26] BWI Group commenced 1 November 2009.

Operations[edit]
As of November 2015[update], Delphi has four diversified business segments:[2]

"Electrical/Electronic Architecture" provides complete vehicle electrical systems, integrating wiring and cable assemblies, electrical centers and connection systems.
"Electronics & Safety" provides components, systems and software for both passive and active safety, security, comfort and infotainment, as well as other vehicular electronic controls.
"Powertrain Systems" provides integrated gasoline and diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, valve train fuel injection, combustion controls, electronics, and a complete line of aftermarket products and services. 3 May 2017, Spin off announced for Powertrain
"Product & Service Solutions" provides auto parts from OE divisions and OE competitors for the aftermarket.

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

EnerDel – started as a joint venture of Ener1 and Delphi. In August 2008, Ener1 bought exclusive ownership of EnerDel.[29]
Condumex – A Grupo Carso division

Senior management[edit]
On 4 November 2009, Delphi named a new board[30] with John A. Krol as the chairman. Kevin P. Clark has been the President and chief executive officer of the company[31] since March 2015.
Environmental record[edit]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Delphi corp. as the 21st-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States in 2002.[32] According to the study, the manufacturer's most toxic emissions included asbestos (542 lb/yr), chromium compounds (1,082 lb/yr), lead compounds (8,466 lb/yr), and sulfuric acid (17,600 lbs/year), while the most massive emissions were glycol ethers (111,520 lbs/year) and hydrochloric acid (80,000 lb/yr).[33]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]

History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of the brake hose manufacturing business in Dayton, Ohio to Harco Manufacturing Group, announced in January 2007.[18]
The settlement of a social plan in the "Concurso," or Spanish insolvency proceeding, of Delphi Automotive Systems Espana S.L.
The sale of the Mexican brake components business, including a manufacturing plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, to Robert Bosch LLC and its affiliate Frenados Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V., announced in June 2007.[19]
The sale of substantially all of the assets of MobileAria, Inc. to Wireless Matrix USA, Inc.
The sale of the U.S. Battery operations in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2006.[20]
The wind-down of a Delphi Medical Texas facility in Houston, Texas
The consolidation of fuel injector production in Rochester, New York during 2006-2007, which allowed the Debtors to wind down a manufacturing facility in Coopersville, Michigan
The sale of the catalyst business to Umicore, completed in October, 2007.[21]
The sale of the Wheel bearings business based in Sandusky, Ohio to Kyklos, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hephaestus Holdings, Inc., in February 2008.[22]
The sale of the Interiors and Closures business was announced in October, 2007, to Renco Group. This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]
Sale of global suspension and brakes business ("Global Ride Dynamics") to BeijingWest announced 31 March 2009.[26] BWI Group commenced 1 November 2009.

Operations[edit]
As of November 2015[update], Delphi has four diversified business segments:[2]

"Electrical/Electronic Architecture" provides complete vehicle electrical systems, integrating wiring and cable assemblies, electrical centers and connection systems.
"Electronics & Safety" provides components, systems and software for both passive and active safety, security, comfort and infotainment, as well as other vehicular electronic controls.
"Powertrain Systems" provides integrated gasoline and diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, valve train fuel injection, combustion controls, electronics, and a complete line of aftermarket products and services. 3 May 2017, Spin off announced for Powertrain
"Product & Service Solutions" provides auto parts from OE divisions and OE competitors for the aftermarket.

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

EnerDel – started as a joint venture of Ener1 and Delphi. In August 2008, Ener1 bought exclusive ownership of EnerDel.[29]
Condumex – A Grupo Carso division

Senior management[edit]
On 4 November 2009, Delphi named a new board[30] with John A. Krol as the chairman. Kevin P. Clark has been the President and chief executive officer of the company[31] since March 2015.
Environmental record[edit]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Delphi corp. as the 21st-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States in 2002.[32] According to the study, the manufacturer's most toxic emissions included asbestos (542 lb/yr), chromium compounds (1,082 lb/yr), lead compounds (8,466 lb/yr), and sulfuric acid (17,600 lbs/year), while the most massive emissions were glycol ethers (111,520 lbs/year) and hydrochloric acid (80,000 lb/yr).[33]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]

1994: General Motors formed Automotive Components Group (ACG)
1995: ACG renamed Delphi Automotive Systems
1997: GM and Hughes Electronics Corporation spun off from Hughes Defense electronics business, and transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes to Delphi
1999: Delphi Automotive Systems became a fully independent publicly held corporation
2000: Delphi purchased UK based Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW Inc, who had purchased its parent LucasVarity plc in 1999
2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of the brake hose manufacturing business in Dayton, Ohio to Harco Manufacturing Group, announced in January 2007.[18]
The settlement of a social plan in the "Concurso," or Spanish insolvency proceeding, of Delphi Automotive Systems Espana S.L.
The sale of the Mexican brake components business, including a manufacturing plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, to Robert Bosch LLC and its affiliate Frenados Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V., announced in June 2007.[19]
The sale of substantially all of the assets of MobileAria, Inc. to Wireless Matrix USA, Inc.
The sale of the U.S. Battery operations in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2006.[20]
The wind-down of a Delphi Medical Texas facility in Houston, Texas
The consolidation of fuel injector production in Rochester, New York during 2006-2007, which allowed the Debtors to wind down a manufacturing facility in Coopersville, Michigan
The sale of the catalyst business to Umicore, completed in October, 2007.[21]
The sale of the Wheel bearings business based in Sandusky, Ohio to Kyklos, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hephaestus Holdings, Inc., in February 2008.[22]
The sale of the Interiors and Closures business was announced in October, 2007, to Renco Group. This includes facilities in: Gadsden, Alabama, Cottondale, Alabama, North Kansas City, Missouri, Orion, Michigan, Adrian, Michigan, Woerth, France, Matamoros, Mexico, the SDADS Joint Venture in Shanghai, China and the KDS Joint Venture in Daegu, South Korea.[23]
The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]
Sale of global suspension and brakes business ("Global Ride Dynamics") to BeijingWest announced 31 March 2009.[26] BWI Group commenced 1 November 2009.

Operations[edit]
As of November 2015[update], Delphi has four diversified business segments:[2]

"Electrical/Electronic Architecture" provides complete vehicle electrical systems, integrating wiring and cable assemblies, electrical centers and connection systems.
"Electronics & Safety" provides components, systems and software for both passive and active safety, security, comfort and infotainment, as well as other vehicular electronic controls.
"Powertrain Systems" provides integrated gasoline and diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, valve train fuel injection, combustion controls, electronics, and a complete line of aftermarket products and services. 3 May 2017, Spin off announced for Powertrain
"Product & Service Solutions" provides auto parts from OE divisions and OE competitors for the aftermarket.

Controversies[edit]
On 4 March 2005, Delphi said it had fired its CFO and would restate earnings between 1999, when Delphi spun off from General Motors Corp (GM), and 2004 for improper reporting of rebates, credits, or other payments from suppliers.[27] In June, 2006, Delphi said in a filing that it would restate its 2005 report, which would increase Delphi's reported 2004 net loss by $65 million. In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
Joint ventures[edit]

EnerDel – started as a joint venture of Ener1 and Delphi. In August 2008, Ener1 bought exclusive ownership of EnerDel.[29]
Condumex – A Grupo Carso division

Senior management[edit]
On 4 November 2009, Delphi named a new board[30] with John A. Krol as the chairman. Kevin P. Clark has been the President and chief executive officer of the company[31] since March 2015.
Environmental record[edit]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Delphi corp. as the 21st-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States in 2002.[32] According to the study, the manufacturer's most toxic emissions included asbestos (542 lb/yr), chromium compounds (1,082 lb/yr), lead compounds (8,466 lb/yr), and sulfuric acid (17,600 lbs/year), while the most massive emissions were glycol ethers (111,520 lbs/year) and hydrochloric acid (80,000 lb/yr).[33]

2001: 11,500 jobs cut worldwide (Bischoff 1A)
2002: Delphi Automotive Systems renamed Delphi Corporation reflecting its diversified business direction
2004: Delphi subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for irregular accounting practices and financial transactions
2005: Delphi disclosed irregular accounting practices. A number of executives, including CFO Alan Dawes, resigned. Delphi Chairman J.T. Battenberg retired. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its struggling U.S. operations.[4] As a result of this action, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted an application by the New York Stock Exchange to delist Delphi's common stock and bonds.[5] The stock traded over the counter on the Pink Sheets electronic exchange. Twenty-four U.S plants closed.
2006: Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. The eight plants it intended to keep were in Brookhaven, Mississippi; Clinton, Mississippi; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kokomo, Indiana; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Warren, Ohio; and Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi proposed that these remaining plants operate with wage and workforce reductions.
February 2007: Plants in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, closed, with a loss of 1,600 direct jobs, and more than 2,500 indirect jobs.[6] despite having agreed to continue its manufacturing operations until 2010 and receiving more than €25 million from various public administrations in order to guarantee its workers' jobs.[7] The Regional Government of Andalusia announced it would begin legal action against the company for breach of local labor laws.[8]
May 2008: Delphi sued its investors for US$ 2.55 billion in securities to aid Delphi as it sought to come out of bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in New York ruled to allow Delphi to seek payments through a contract against Appaloosa Management LP as well as denying investors' request for a cap of $250 million for damages.[9][clarification needed]
27 April 2009: CoolIT Systems announced the acquisition of the assets of Delphi Thermal Liquid Cooling including intellectual property, machinery, and equipment.[10][11]
6 October 2009: Delphi's core assets purchased by a group of private investors to create a new Delphi Corporation. Some of its non-core steering operations sold to General Motors Company, the successor to the bankrupt Motors Liquidation Company that used to be the old General Motors Corporation. The stock was cancelled. The old Delphi Corporation was renamed DPH Holdings Corporation.[12] The new Delphi incorporated in the United Kingdom.[13]
1 July 2015: Delphi sold their Thermal Business unit to Mahle-Behr GmbH. Together, the Mahle-Behr and Delphi Thermal merger represented the second largest supplier of automotive thermal management systems including interior HVAC components, under-hood powertrain cooling and compressors.[14]
11 December 2015 Delphi announced improvements to self driving technology under development.[15]
On June 3, 2016, Delphi partnered with Carbon to allow use of Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology and printers.[16]
3 May 2017, Delphi planned to spin off its powertrain business and focus on electric vehicles and driverless technology.[17]

Chapter 11 reorganization[edit]
During the Chapter 11 cases, Delphi made substantial progress in identifying and implementing the sale (or receiving Bankruptcy Court approval to sell) or wind down of those facilities and business lines that do not support the company’s future strategic framework, including:

The sale of certain North American Brake Component Machining and Assembly Assets to TRW Automotive Holdings, which includes sites in Saginaw, Michigan, Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Oshawa, Canada, announced in September 2007.[24]
The sale of various components and steering operations to the new General Motors Company was announced on 3 August 2009. Delphi Thermal Systems, Powertrain, Powertrain Systems Grand Rapids, and Electronics and Safety became part of GM Components Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GM. Delphi Steering, two regional engineering centers, and 15 manufacturing locations in Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Australia became part of GM Global Steering Holdings LLC, also a subsidiary of GM.[25]

In 2013, Delphi became involved in an ongoing lawsuit against GM, because it manufactures ignition switches for the Chevrolet Cobalt, whose original design is alleged to be defective.[28]
