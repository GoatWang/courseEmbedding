How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

The increase was primarily due to investments for the implementation of additional product categories such as online financial services, accommodation reservation, and transportation ticketing, increase in direct procurement related personnel at regional service centers, improvement of online technology, and the rise in technology and product development personnel related expenses.

 

Sales and marketing expenses were RMB394.8 million (US$60.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015, representing a year-over-year increase of 175.9%.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the headcount of our administrative personnel as a result of our business expansion, such as regional service center expansion and product category expansion.

Loss from operations was RMB561.4 million (US$86.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a loss from operations of RMB176.5 million in the corresponding period in 2014.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

We will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately US$58.1 million
(RMB351.8 million), or approximately US$68.2 million (RMB412.6 million) if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
ADSs by the selling shareholders. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds
of approximately US$34.5 million (RMB208.7 million) from the Concurrent Private
Placement.

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us from this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placement for the following purposes:

. proximately US$30.0 million (RMB181.6 million) to expand our sales and 
  marketing efforts;  

. proximately US$20.0 million (RMB121.1 million) to expand our product 
  selection and offerings;  

. proximately US$10.0 million (RMB60.5 million) to strengthen our technology 
  and product development capabilities; and  

. the balance for general corporate purposes, including strategic investments 
  in and acquisitions of complementary businesses, although we have not 
  identified any near-term investment or acquisition targets.  

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount 
of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our 
business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in 
applying the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering 
differently than as described in this prospectus. 

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws 
and regulations to provide funding to our existing PRC subsidiaries only 
through loans or capital contributions, or to establish new PRC subsidiaries, 
if we satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements. 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a 
timely basis, if at all. 

Pending any use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to hold our 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand 
deposits.


We compete primarily with all other types of online travel companies. In
addition, we compete with traditional travel service providers and tour
operators. In our self-guided tour business, as we sell packaged tours which
include flights and hotels, we also compete with airlines and hotels, which in
recent years have made efforts to improve their direct sales. Large, established
Internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel products
in various destinations around the world. Factors affecting our competitiveness
include, among other things, price, availability and breadth of choice of travel
products and services, brand recognition, customer services, and ease of use,
accessibility, security and reliability of our transaction and service
infrastructure.

Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater financial,
marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, certain of our
competitors may be acquired by, receive investment from or enter into strategic
relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies or
investors. They may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and
promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to website and
system development than us.


Company Description
We are a leading online leisure travel company in China. We offer a large
selection of packaged tours, including organized tours and self-guided tours, as
well as travel-related services for leisure travelers. We ranked first in
China’s online organized tours market as measured by transaction value


 in 2013,
according to iResearch, a third-party research firm. We believe we are well
positioned to benefit from the significant growth potential of China’s online
leisure travel market, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth
rate, or CAGR, of 35.6% from 2013 to 2016 as measured by transaction value,
according to iResearch.

We started offering packaged tours online in 2007, and are among the earliest
Chinese companies that focus on the online leisure travel market. As an early
mover in China’s online leisure travel market, we have sold over three million
packaged tours since our inception. We offer packaged tours sourced from over
3,000 travel suppliers, covering over 70 countries as well as all popular
tourist attractions in China. Our product portfolio consists of over 100,000
stock-keeping units, or SKUs, of organized tours, over 100,000 SKUs of
self-guided tours, and tickets for over 1,000 domestic and overseas tourist
attractions. Our core strength is in overseas leisure travel products and
services, which contributed over 70% of our gross bookings in 2013.

We have established “Tuniu” as a trusted and widely recognized brand in leisure
travel in China, powered by a compelling customer experience. Our online
platform, which comprises our tuniu.com website and mobile platform, provides
comprehensive product and travel information through user-friendly interfaces to
enable leisure travelers to plan their travels and search for itineraries that
best suit their needs. Our online platform contains travel guides featuring
photos, information and recommendations for all destinations we cover, as well
as user-generated content that serves as valuable references for other
travelers. We have more than 900,000 customer reviews about our products and
services and over 20,000 travel stories on our online platform.

To cultivate customer loyalty and ensure customer satisfaction, we complement
our online platform with an extensive nationwide service network, including our
centralized call center in Nanjing and 15 regional service centers across China.
We have a team of over 400 well-trained tour advisors to closely assist
customers through their booking process. We believe that our high-quality
customer service has contributed to the continuous growth in our customer base.
The total number of trips sold by us grew from approximately 850,000 in 2012 to
approximately 1,280,000 in 2013.

Our recognized brand in leisure travel and growing customer base enable us to
source a broad range of products from high-quality travel suppliers at
competitive prices. We rigorously select our travel suppliers to ensure quality 
and reliability. We have developed our proprietary supply chain management 
system—N-booking system—to streamline our interactions with travel suppliers, 
allowing them to receive booking information real-time, more efficiently 
manage travel products and better understand customer preferences.

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
