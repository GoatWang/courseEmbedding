	Republic’s
	Tax Refund Solutions (“TRS”) on Track for Record Net Income in 2011




	LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 1, 2011--Republic Bancorp, Inc.
	(“Republic” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RBCAA), through its subsidiary
	Republic Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank”), is pleased to announce its
	interim results for the Company’s TRS 2011 tax season. Through the first
	two months of 2011, net income at TRS totaled approximately $62 million,
	an increase of nearly $25 million, or 70%, compared to the first two
	months of 2010. The increase in TRS net income was driven by an increase
	in Electronic Refund Check/Electronic Refund Deposit (“ERC/ERD”) product
	volume, more favorable pricing terms for the Company’s Refund
	Anticipation Loan (“RAL”) product and better than projected loan loss
	provisions for RALs.


	As a result of its strong interim results at TRS, management currently
	estimates that its first quarter total Company net income will be in a
	range between $68 million and $75 million with a diluted Class A
	earnings per share range between $3.25 and $3.57 per share. The actual
	results for the quarter will be significantly dependent upon
	management’s overall projections, which are based in part on the
	following assumed ranges:



	ERC/ERD volume between 350,000 and 450,000 products during March 2011.


	RAL origination volume between 38,000 and 44,000 products during March
	2011.


	An estimated RAL loan loss rate as of March 31, 2011, between 1.50%
	and 2.00% of total RALs originated.


	A Traditional Banking segment provision for loan losses of $2.2
	million to $3.4 million for the quarter.



	The Bank’s goal entering the 2011 tax season was to achieve a final RAL
	loan loss rate of 2.50% or less. Through the date of this filing, RALs
	outstanding past their expected funding date, which represents potential
	loan losses, was 2.13% of total RALs originated. Management expects this
	percentage rate to improve each week as the Bank continues to receive
	payments from the IRS. Based on the Bank’s current RALs outstanding past
	their expected funding date and management’s expectations of future
	payments from the IRS, management projects Republic’s final loan loss
	rate related to RALs for 2011 to be within a range of 1.50% - 2.00% of
	total RALs originated. Each 0.10% of loss rate equates to approximately
	$1.0 million in pre-tax expense for 2011.


	In addition to the Company’s solid RAL underwriting results, the number
	of federal ERCs/ERDs processed through the first two months of 2011 was
	up 62% compared to the first two months of 2010. As expected, the
	Company’s RAL origination volume was down significantly compared to the
	first two months of 2010. Overall, the Company has originated $1.0
	billion in RALs through the first two months of 2011 compared to $2.8
	billion for the same period in 2010. The decrease in the Company’s RAL
	origination volume was primarily due to its revised underwriting and
	application requirements in combination with its reduced maximum RAL
	offering amount of $1,500 per customer.




















	The Company publishes these results on an interim basis in light of the
	Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (the “FDIC”) concerns regarding
	the safety and soundness of its RAL program as expressed in the FDIC’s
	Notice of Charges for an Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Hearing
	(the “Notice”) previously disclosed. A copy of the Notice is set forth
	as Exhibit 10.1 of the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the “SEC”) on February 10, 2011. On February 28, 2011, the
	Bank filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western
	District of Kentucky against the FDIC seeking to protect its right to a
	fair administrative hearing and review, free from retaliation, and to
	require the FDIC to follow an appropriate rulemaking process.


	As described more fully in the periodic filings of Republic with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission, the Bank, through its TRS segment,
	is one of a limited number of financial institutions that facilitates
	the processing of federal and state tax refund products through third
	party tax-preparers and tax preparation software companies in the United
	States. The Bank’s three primary tax-related products are: ERCs, ERDs
	and RALs. The Bank charges its customers $29.95 for its ERC/ERD products
	and $61.22 for its RAL product.


	The Bank has operated in the tax refund product industry for 15 years.
	RB&T is one of the largest providers of these services in the country
	providing tax refund-based products to over 3 million taxpayers during
	2010. During its peak processing time, the Bank employs over 400 people
	in downtown Louisville to deliver its products and respond to customer
	questions. Substantially all of the business generated by TRS occurs in
	the first quarter of the calendar year.




	Forward-Looking Statements




	This press release contains forward-looking statements within the
	meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
	forward-looking statements in the preceding paragraphs are based on our
	current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy
	and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate
	to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and
	changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual
	results may differ materially from those contemplated by the
	forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on
	any of these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
	on which they are made. They are neither statements of historical fact
	nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors
	that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
	forward-looking statements include consumer demand for the Bank’s tax
	refund products, consumer demand for income tax return preparation
	services and tax services generally, unanticipated losses on RALs and
	within the Traditional Banking segment, regulatory proceedings to
	curtail or exit the RAL business, overall tax refund product mix and
	overhead cost to the Bank, and other factors disclosed from time to time
	in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission, including those factors set forth as “Risk Factors” at Part
	I, Item 1A in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
	30, 2010. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any
	forward-looking statements.

Protect your account. Let us know before you go.

MasterCard SecureCode

MasterCard SecureCode enhances your current Republic Bank MasterCard account with a secret code to protect against unauthorized use of your card when you shop at participating merchants.
What is MasterCard® SecureCode?
MasterCard SecureCode is a new service to enhance your existing MasterCard account. A private code means added protection against unauthorized use of your card when you shop at participating online merchants.
How does MasterCard SecureCode work?
Once you've registered and created your own private SecureCode, you will be automatically prompted by your financial institution at checkout to provide your SecureCode each time you make a purchase with a participating online merchant. Your SecureCode is quickly confirmed by your financial institution and then your purchase is completed. Your SecureCode will never be shared with the merchant. It's just like entering your PIN at an ATM.
How does MasterCard SecureCode protect me?
When you correctly enter your SecureCode during a purchase at a participating online merchant, you confirm that you are the authorized cardholder and your purchase is then completed. If an incorrect SecureCode is entered, the purchase will not be completed. Even if someone knows your credit or debit card number, the purchase cannot be completed without your SecureCode at a participating merchant.
Sign Up Today for MasterCard SecureCode
If you are a client of Republic Bank please click here to enroll.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Republic Bancorp, Inc. (the "Parent Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Republic Bank & Trust Company ("RB&T" or the "Bank") and Republic Insurance Services, Inc. (the "Captive"). The Bank is a Kentucky-based, state chartered non-member financial institution that provides both traditional and non-traditional banking products through four distinct operating segments using a multitude of delivery channels. While the Bank operates primarily in its market footprint, its non-brick-and-mortar delivery channels allow it to reach clients across the United States.  The Captive is a Nevada-based, wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of the Company. The Captive provides property and casualty insurance coverage to the Company and the Bank as well as 10 other third-party insurance captives for which insurance may not be available or economically feasible.  Republic Bancorp Capital Trust ("RBCT") is a Delaware statutory business trust that is a wholly-owned unconsolidated finance subsidiary of Republic Bancorp, Inc.  All companies are collectively referred to as ("Republic" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPOSITION  As of March 31, 2017, the Company was divided into four distinct operating segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending ("Warehouse"), Mortgage Banking and Republic Processing Group ("RPG"). Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute "Core Bank" or "Core Banking" activities. Correspondent Lending operations and the Company's national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank(R), are considered part of Traditional Banking. The RPG segment includes the following divisions: Tax Refund Solutions ("TRS"), Republic Credit Solutions ("RCS") and Republic Payment Solutions ("RPS"). TRS generates the majority of RPG's income, with the relatively smaller divisions of RPG, RCS and RPS, considered immaterial for separate and independent segment reporting. All divisions of the RPG segment operate through the Bank.  Table 1 - Segment Information Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Core Banking Total Republic Traditional Warehouse Mortgage Core Processing Total (dollars in thousands) Banking Lending Banking Banking Group Company Net income $ 6,363 $ 2,128 $ 16 $ 8,507 $ 11,510 $ 20,017 Total assets 4,017,173 493,127 15,080 4,525,380 139,412 4,664,792 Net interest margin 3.30 % 3.57 % NM 3.33 % NM 4.99 %   Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Core Banking Total Republic Traditional Warehouse Mortgage Core Processing Total (dollars in thousands) Banking Lending Banking Banking Group Company Net income $ 6,750 $ 1,224 $ 94 $ 8,068 $ 9,667 $ 17,735 Total assets 3,711,315 393,532 12,965 4,117,812 128,953 4,246,765 Net interest margin 3.08 % 3.63 % NM 3.12 % NM 3.78 %  Segment assets are reported as of the respective period ends while income and margin data are reported for the respective periods.  NM - Not Meaningful  For expanded segment financial data see Footnote 16 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  Table of Contents  (I) Traditional Banking segment  The Traditional Banking segment provides traditional banking products primarily to customers in the Company's market footprint. As of March 31, 2017, Republic had 45 full-service banking centers and one loan production office ("LPO") with locations as follows:  ?Kentucky - 33  ?Metropolitan Louisville - 19  ?Central Kentucky - 9  ?Elizabethtown - 1  ?Frankfort - 1  ?Georgetown - 1  ?Lexington - 5  ?Shelbyville - 1  ?Western Kentucky - 2  ?Owensboro - 2  ?Northern Kentucky - 3  ?Covington - 1  ?Florence - 1  ?Independence - 1  ?Southern Indiana - 3  ?Floyds Knobs - 1  ?Jeffersonville - 1  ?New Albany - 1  ?Metropolitan Tampa, Florida - 6  ?Metropolitan Cincinnati, Ohio - 1  ?Metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee - 3*  *Includes one LPO  Republic's headquarters are located in Louisville, which is the largest city in Kentucky based on population.  As of March 31, 2017 and through the date of this filing, generally all Traditional Banking products and services, except for the EarnMore deposit account, were offered through the Company's traditional RB&T brand. The EarnMore deposit account was offered through the Bank's national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank.  The Bank's principal lending activities consist of the following:  Retail Mortgage Lending - Through its retail banking centers, its Correspondent Lending channel and its Internet Banking channel, the Bank originates single family, residential real estate loans. In addition, the Bank originates home equity amortizing loans ("HEALs") and home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") through its retail banking centers. Such loans are generally collateralized by owner occupied property.  Commercial Lending - The Bank conducts commercial lending activities primarily through its Commercial and Corporate Banking (the "CCB Department") and its Business Banking Department.  The CCB Department is composed of the following divisions: Corporate Banking; Commercial Finance; Municipal Lending; and Republic Realty. All credit approvals and processing for the CCB Department are prepared and underwritten through the Bank's existing Credit Administration Department ("CAD"). Clients are generally located within the Bank's market footprint, including adjacent areas that are within approximately two-hour drive of a specific market.  The Business Banking Department focuses on locally based small-to-medium sized businesses in the Bank's market footprint with revenues of $1 million to $20 million. The needs of Business Banking clients range from expansion or acquisition, equipment financing, owner-occupied real estate financing, and operating lines of credit. Business Banking utilizes all appropriate programs of the Small Business Administration ("SBA") to reduce credit risk exposure. Additionally, Business Banking includes making loans to real estate investors for various types of investment properties, including rental homes and apartments, shopping centers,  Table of Contents  and office buildings. Business Banking also makes loans to various not-for-profit agencies located within the Bank's market footprint. The targeted credit size for a relationship in this segment is between $500,000 and $5 million.  Construction and Land Development Lending - The Bank originates business loans for the construction of both single family residential properties and commercial properties (apartment complexes, shopping centers, office buildings). On a much smaller scale, the Bank may originate loans for the acquisition and development of residential or commercial land into buildable lots.  Internet Lending - The Bank accepts online loan applications for its RB&T brand through its website at www.republicbank.com. Historically, the majority of loans originated through the internet have been within the Bank's traditional markets of Kentucky and Indiana. Other states where loans are marketed include California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, as well as, the District of Columbia.  Correspondent Lending - Primarily from its Warehouse clients, the Core Bank acquires for investment single family, first lien mortgage loans that meet the Core Bank's specifications through its Correspondent Lending channel. Substantially all loans purchased through the Correspondent Lending channel are purchased at a premium.  Consumer Lending - Traditional consumer loans made by the Bank include home improvement and home equity loans, other secured and unsecured personal loans, and credit cards. With the exception of home equity loans, which are actively marketed in conjunction with single family, first lien residential real estate loans, other traditional consumer loan products, while available, are not and have not been actively promoted in the Bank's markets.  The Bank has, from time to time, acquired unsecured consumer installment loans for investment from a third-party originator. Such consumer loans were purchased at par and were selected by the Bank based on certain underwriting characteristics.  Indirect Lending - In 2015, the Bank began to grow its presence in the consumer automobile loan market. The program involves establishing relationships with automobile dealers in the Bank's market footprint and obtaining consumer automobile loans in a low-cost delivery method. As a result of its success in Indirect Auto Lending, the Bank entered Dealer Floor Plan Lending during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Bank's other Traditional Banking activities generally consists of the following:  MemoryBank - In October 2016, the Bank opened the "digital doors" of MemoryBank, a national branchless banking platform. MemoryBank is a separately branded division of the Bank, which from a marketing perspective, focuses on technologically savvy customers that prefer to carry larger balances in highly-liquid bank accounts. The Bank promotes the EarnMore account solely through its MemoryBank brand.  Private Banking - The Bank provides financial products and services to high net worth individuals through its Private Banking Department. The Bank's Private Banking officers have extensive banking experience and are trained to meet the unique financial needs of this clientele.  Treasury Management Services - The Bank provides various deposit products designed for commercial business clients located throughout its market areas. Lockbox processing, business on-site deposit, business on-line banking, Internet bill pay, payroll processing, virtual vault, courier service, controlled disbursement accounts, corporate purchasing credit cards, account reconciliation and Automated Clearing House ("ACH") processing are additional services offered to commercial businesses through the Bank's Treasury Management Department.  Internet Banking - The Bank expands its market penetration and service delivery of its RB&T brand by offering clients Internet Banking services and products through its website, www.republicbank.com.  Mobile Banking - The Bank allows clients to easily and securely access and manage their accounts through its mobile banking application.  Other Banking Services - The Bank also provides title insurance and other financial institution related products and services.  Bank Acquisitions - The Bank maintains an acquisition strategy to selectively grow its franchise as a complement to its organic growth strategies.  Table of Contents  See additional detail regarding the Traditional Banking segment under Footnote  (II) Warehouse Lending segment  The Bank provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the United States through mortgage warehouse lines of credit. These credit facilities are primarily secured by single family, first lien residential real estate loans. The credit facility enables the mortgage banking clients to close single family, first lien residential real estate loans in their own name and temporarily fund their inventory of these closed loans until the loans are sold to investors approved by the Bank or purchased by the Bank through its Correspondent Lending channel. Individual loans are expected to remain on the warehouse line for an average of 15 to 30 days. Reverse mortgage loans typically remain on the line longer than conventional mortgage loans. Interest income and loan fees are accrued for each individual loan during the time the loan remains on the warehouse line and collected when the loan is sold. The Bank receives the sale proceeds of each loan directly from the investor and applies the funds to pay off the warehouse advance and related accrued interest and fees. The remaining proceeds are credited to the mortgage-banking client.  See additional detail regarding the Warehouse Lending segment under Footnote 16 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  (III) Mortgage Banking segment  Mortgage Banking activities primarily include 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed-term single family, first lien residential real estate loans that are sold into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC" or "Freddie Mac") and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA" or "Fannie Mae"). The Bank typically retains servicing on loans sold into the secondary market. Administration of loans with servicing retained by the Bank includes collecting principal and interest payments, escrowing funds for property taxes and property insurance, and remitting payments to secondary market investors. A fee is received by the Bank for performing these standard servicing functions.  See additional detail regarding Mortgage Banking under Footnote 11 "Mortgage Banking Activities" and Footnote 16 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  (IV) Republic Processing Group segment  Tax Refund Solutions ("TRS") division - Through its TRS division, the Bank is one of a limited number of financial institutions that facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products and offers a credit product through third-party tax preparers located throughout the United States, as well as tax-preparation software providers (collectively, the "Tax Providers"). Substantially all of the business generated by the TRS division occurs in the first half of the year. The TRS division traditionally operates at a loss during the second half of the year, during which time the division incurs costs preparing for the upcoming year's first quarter tax season.  Refund Transfers ("RTs") are fee-based products whereby a tax refund is issued to the taxpayer after the Bank has received the refund from the federal or state government. There is no credit risk or borrowing cost associated with these products because they are only delivered to the taxpayer upon receipt of the refund directly from the governmental paying authority.  "Easy Advance" Product  The Easy Advance ("EA") tax credit product is a loan that allows a taxpayer to receive an advance of a portion of their refund, with the taxpayer's Tax Provider paying all fees to RB&T for the advance.  Table of Contents  TRS first offered its EA tax credit product during the first two months of 2016 and for a second successive year during the first two months of 2017. For the first quarter 2017 tax season, the Company modified the EA product offering to allow more than one advance amount and a different price structure to the Tax Providers based on the amount borrowed by the taxpayer. All other features of the product remained substantially the same as those from the first quarter 2016 tax season, including the following:  � No EA fee charged to the taxpayer customer;  � All fees for the product were paid by the Tax Providers with a restriction prohibiting the Tax Providers from passing along the fees to the taxpayer customer;  � No requirement that the taxpayer customer pay for another bank product, such as an RT;  � Multiple funds disbursement methods, including direct deposit, prepaid card, check or Walmart Direct2Cash(R) product, based on the taxpayer customer's election;  � Repayment of the EA to the Bank was deducted from the taxpayer customer's tax refund proceeds; and  � If an insufficient refund to repay the EA occurred:  o there was no recourse to the taxpayer customer,  o no negative credit reporting on the taxpayer customer, and  o no collection efforts against the taxpayer customer.  Fees paid by the Tax Providers to the Company for the EA product are reported as interest income on loans. EAs during 2017 and 2016 were generally repaid within three weeks after the taxpayer customer's tax return was submitted to the applicable taxing authority. EAs do not have a contractual due date but are eligible for delinquency consideration three weeks after the taxpayer customer's tax return is submitted to the applicable taxing authority. Provisions for loan losses on EAs are estimated when advances are made, with all expected loss provisions made in the first quarter of each year. Unpaid EAs are generally charged-off within 81 days after the taxpayer customer's tax return is submitted to the applicable taxing authority, with the majority of charge-offs typically recorded during the second quarter of the year.  Related to the overall credit losses on EAs, the Bank's ability to control those losses is highly dependent upon its ability to predict the taxpayer's likelihood to receive the tax refund as claimed on the taxpayer's tax return. Each year, the Bank's EA approval model is based primarily on the prior-year's tax refund funding patterns. Because much of the loan volume occurs each year before that year's tax refund funding patterns can be analyzed and subsequent underwriting changes made, credit losses during a current year could be higher than management's predictions if tax refund funding patterns change materially between years.  See additional detail regarding the Easy Advance ("EA") product under Footnote 5 "Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  Republic Credit Solutions ("RCS") division - RCS is managed and operated within the RPG business segment. Through the RCS division, the Bank offers consumer credit products. In general, the credit products are unsecured, small dollar consumer loans with maturities of 30 days or more, and are dependent on various factors including the consumer's ability to repay.  RCS originates, primarily for sale, both a line-of-credit product and a credit card product. The Bank sells 90% of the balances maintained through these two products within two days of loan origination and retains a 10% interest. The Company carries such loans at the lower of cost or fair value. The line-of-credit product represented the substantial majority of RCS activity during the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, as RCS expanded in June 2015 beyond its pilot phase. In December 2015, RCS began piloting its credit card product. Any gains or losses on the sale of RCS products are reported as a component of "Program fees."  During the first quarter of 2016, RCS initiated an installment loan product, in which the Company sells 100% of these loans approximately 21 days after origination. The Company classifies these loans as held for sale and carries them at fair value, with this portfolio marked to market on a monthly basis with changes in its fair value reported as a component of Program fees.  During the first quarter of 2016, RCS initiated a healthcare receivables product. RCS works with healthcare providers to finance the healthcare services for their patients. RCS retains 100% of these loans.  The operating results of the RCS division were immaterial to the Company's overall results of operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and were reported as part of the RPG segment. The RCS division will not be reported as a separate segment until such time, if any, that it meets reporting thresholds.  Table of Contents  Republic Payment Solutions ("RPS") division - RPS is managed and operated within the RPG business segment. The RPS division is an issuing bank offering general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards through third-party program managers. For the projected near-term, as the prepaid card program matures, the operating results of the RPS division are expected to be immaterial to the Company's overall results of operations and will be reported as part of the RPG segment. The RPS division will not be reported as a separate segment until such time, if any, that it meets reporting thresholds.  OVERVIEW (Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016)  Total Company net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $20.0 million, a $2.3 million, or 13%, increase from the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per Class A Common Share increased to $0.96 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared from $0.85 for the same period in 2016.  The Company's Core Banking noninterest expenses, which include the noninterest expenses of the Traditional Banking segment, the Warehouse Lending segment, and the Mortgage Banking segment, were impacted by several initiatives during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016. The long-term goal of these initiatives is to geographically expand and grow the Company's loan and deposit client base, enhance client service through expanded hours and delivery channels, diversify the Company's product mix, and to create greater operating efficiencies. Significant costs for some of the Company's more notable strategic investments made over the previous 12 months include the following:  � Expansion of the Company's footprint into St. Petersburg, Florida through its May 2016 acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc. ("Cornerstone").  � The October 2016 launch of MemoryBank, a separately-branded, nationwide digital banking platform, which has raised $28 million in deposits during the first three months of 2017.  � The October 2016 introduction of Dealer Floor Plan Lending, which had $8 million of loans outstanding at March 31, 2017.  � The opening of the Company's new Vine Street location in downtown Lexington, Kentucky.  � The opening of a new loan production office in Brentwood (Nashville), Tennessee.  � Expanded contact center hours to 7 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week.  � The pilot introduction of six interactive teller machines ("ITMs") into four of the Company's banking centers, with an expected expansion into additional . . .

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Republic Bancorp, Inc.

See additional discussion under Part I Item 1 "Business" and Part I Item 1A "Risk Factors" of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Table of Contents  PENDING ACQUISITION OF CORNERSTONE BANCORP, INC.  Effective October 6, 2015, the Company and Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc. ("Cornerstone"), the parent company of Cornerstone Community Bank ("CCB"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will acquire Cornerstone, with CCB merging into RB&T. Cornerstone and CCB are headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will acquire all of Cornerstone's outstanding common stock in an all-cash transaction, resulting in a total cash payment to Cornerstone's existing shareholders and stock option holders of approximately $32.3 million. The Company will fund the cash payment through existing resources on-hand.  The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016. On March 31, 2016, Cornerstone operated four banking centers in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan statistical area, with approximately $250 million in total assets, approximately $190 million in loans and approximately $210 million in deposits.  See additional detail regarding the Company's acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc. under Footnote 2 "Pending Business Acquisition" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPOSITION  As of March 31, 2016, the Company was divided into four distinct operating segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending ("Warehouse"), Mortgage Banking and Republic Processing Group ("RPG"). Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute "Core Bank" or "Core Banking" activities.  Table 1 - Segment Information Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Core Banking Total Republic Traditional Warehouse Mortgage Core Processing Total (dollars in thousands) Banking Lending Banking Banking Group Company Net income $ 6,750 $ 1,224 $ 94 $ 8,068 $ 9,667 $ 17,735 Total assets 3,711,315 393,532 12,965 4,117,812 128,953 4,246,765 Net interest margin 3.08 % 3.63 % NM 3.12 % NM 3.78 %   Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 Core Banking Total Republic Traditional Warehouse Mortgage Core Processing Total (dollars in thousands) Banking Lending Banking Banking Group Company Net income $ 5,346 $ 1,114 $ 135 $ 6,595 $ 7,193 $ 13,788 Total assets 3,380,813 422,652 18,002 3,821,467 130,720 3,952,187 Net interest margin 3.13 % 3.62 % NM 3.17 % NM 3.14 %  Segment assets are reported as of the respective period ends while income and margin data are reported for the respective periods.  NM - Not Meaningful  For expanded segment financial data see Footnote 15 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  Table of Contents  (I) Traditional Banking segment  The Traditional Banking segment provides traditional banking products primarily to customers in the Company's market footprint. As of March 31, 2016, in addition to Internet Banking and Correspondent Lending delivery channels, Republic had 40 full-service banking centers with locations as follows:  ?Kentucky - 32  ?Metropolitan Louisville - 19  ?Central Kentucky - 8  ?Elizabethtown - 1  ?Frankfort - 1  ?Georgetown - 1  ?Lexington - 4  ?Shelbyville - 1  ?Western Kentucky - 2  ?Owensboro - 2  ?Northern Kentucky - 3  ?Covington - 1  ?Florence - 1  ?Independence - 1  ?Southern Indiana - 3  ?Floyds Knobs - 1  ?Jeffersonville - 1  ?New Albany - 1  ?Metropolitan Tampa, Florida - 2  ?Metropolitan Cincinnati, Ohio - 1  ?Metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee - 2  Republic's headquarters are located in Louisville, which is the largest city in Kentucky based on population.  The Bank's principal lending activities consists of the following:  Retail Mortgage Lending - Through its retail banking centers detailed above, its Correspondent Lending channel and its Internet Banking channel, the Bank originates single family, residential real estate loans. In addition, the Bank originates home equity amortizing loans ("HEAL") and home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") through its retail banking centers. All such loans are generally collateralized by owner occupied property.  Commercial Lending - The Bank's Commercial and Corporate Banking department (the "CCB Department") is composed of Corporate Banking, Commercial Finance, Municipal Lending, and Republic Realty. Corporate Banking's marketing focus is locally-based companies within the Bank's market footprint, typically with revenues of $15 million to $150 million. Commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans typically include those secured by General Business Assets ("GBA"), which consist of equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets owned by the borrower/guarantor. The Commercial Finance Group targets financing for equipment, typically ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 per unit financed with five to seven year terms. The Municipal Lending Area responds to financing requests from cities and counties, largely in the state of Kentucky and in southern Indiana. Republic Realty is focused on originating stabilized commercial real estate ("CRE") loans with low leverage and strong cash flows.  In the previous 18 months, while continuing to increase its total commercial-related loan portfolio, the Bank has strived to diversify its commercial loan mix by increasing the ratio of C&I loans to total commercial loans and conversely decreasing the ratio of CRE loans to total commercial loans.  Construction and Land Development Lending - The Bank originates residential construction real estate loans to finance the construction of single family dwellings. Such loans also are made to contractors to build single family dwellings under contract or directly to consumers. Construction loans are generally offered on the same basis as other single family, first lien residential real estate loans, except that a larger percentage down payment is typically required.  Table of Contents  The Bank also originates land development loans to real estate developers for the acquisition, development and construction of commercial projects.  Internet Lending - The Bank accepts online loan applications through its website, www.republicbank.com. Historically, the majority of loans originated through the internet have been within the Bank's traditional markets of Kentucky and Indiana. Other states where loans are marketed include California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, as well as, the District of Columbia.  Correspondent Lending - Primarily from its Warehouse clients, the Core Bank acquires for investment single family, first lien mortgage loans that meet the Core Bank's specifications through its Correspondent Lending channel. Substantially all loans purchased through the Correspondent Lending channel are purchased at a premium.  Consumer Lending - Traditional consumer loans made by the Bank include home improvement and home equity loans, as well as other secured and unsecured personal loans in addition to credit cards. With the exception of home equity loans, which are actively marketed in conjunction with single family, first lien residential real estate loans, other traditional consumer loan products, while available, are not and have not been actively promoted in the Bank's markets.  The Bank acquires unsecured consumer installment loans for investment from a third-party originator. Such consumer loans are purchased at par and are selected by the Bank based on certain underwriting characteristics.  Indirect Lending - In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bank initiated a formal indirect lending division to grow its presence in the consumer auto loan market. The program involves establishing relationships with automobile dealers in the Bank's market footprint and obtaining new loans in a low cost delivery method. Management believes that this initiative also places the Bank in a position to enter floor plan lending in 2016.  The Bank's other Traditional Banking activities generally consists of the following:  Private Banking - The Bank provides financial products and services to high net worth individuals through its Private Banking Department. The Bank's Private Banking officers have extensive banking experience and are trained to meet the unique financial needs of this clientele.  Treasury Management Services - The Bank provides various deposit products designed for commercial business clients located throughout its market areas. Lockbox processing, business on-site deposit, business on-line banking, Internet bill pay, payroll processing, virtual vault, courier service, controlled disbursement accounts, corporate purchasing credit cards, account reconciliation and Automated Clearing House ("ACH") processing are additional services offered to commercial businesses through the Bank's Treasury Management Department.  Internet Banking - The Bank expands its market penetration and service delivery by offering clients Internet Banking services and products through its website, www.republicbank.com.  Mobile Banking - The Bank allows clients to easily and securely access and manage their accounts through its mobile banking application.  Other Banking Services - The Bank also provides trust, title insurance and other financial institution related products and services.  Bank Acquisitions - The Bank maintains an acquisition strategy to selectively grow its franchise as a complement to its organic growth strategies.  See additional detail regarding the Traditional Banking segment under Footnote  Table of Contents  (II) Warehouse Lending segment  The Bank provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the Nation through mortgage warehouse lines of credit. These credit facilities are secured by single family, first lien residential real estate loans. The credit facility enables the mortgage banking clients to close single family, first lien residential real estate loans in their own name and temporarily fund their inventory of these closed loans until the loans are sold to investors approved by the Bank or purchased by the Bank through its Correspondent Lending channel. Individual loans are expected to remain on the warehouse line for an average of 15 to 30 days. Interest income and loan fees are accrued for each individual loan during the time the loan remains on the warehouse line and collected when the loan is sold. The Bank receives the sale proceeds of each loan directly from the investor and applies the funds to pay off the warehouse advance and related accrued interest and fees. The remaining proceeds are credited to the mortgage banking client.  See additional detail regarding the Warehouse Lending segment under Footnote 15 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  (III) Mortgage Banking segment  Mortgage Banking activities primarily include 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed-term single family, first lien residential real estate loans that are sold into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC" or "Freddie Mac"). The Bank typically retains servicing on these loans. Administration of loans with servicing retained by the Bank includes collecting principal and interest payments, escrowing funds for property taxes and property insurance and remitting payments to secondary market investors. A fee is received by the Bank for performing these standard servicing functions.  See additional detail regarding Mortgage Banking under Footnote 8 "Mortgage Banking Activities" and Footnote 15 "Segment Information" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  (IV) Republic Processing Group segment  All divisions of the RPG segment operate through the Bank.  Tax Refund Solutions division - Republic, through its TRS division, is one of a limited number of financial institutions that facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products through third-party tax preparers located throughout the Nation, as well as tax-preparation software providers. Substantially all of the business generated by the TRS division occurs in the first half of the year. The TRS division traditionally operates at a loss during the second half of the year, during which time the division incurs costs preparing for the upcoming year's first quarter tax season.  RTs are products whereby a tax refund is issued to the taxpayer after the Bank has received the refund from the federal or state government. There is no credit risk or borrowing cost associated with these products because they are only delivered to the taxpayer upon receipt of the refund directly from the governmental paying authority.  New "Easy Advance" Product  Since RB&T's discontinuance of the Refund Anticipation Loans ("RALs") in April 2012, the tax industry, as a whole, has continued to make credit alternatives available to its customer base each year, including the availability of RALs in various states through finance companies. One credit alternative to a traditional RAL the industry has developed is a product that allows a taxpayer to receive an advance of a portion of their refund with no additional fee paid by the taxpayer, and all fees for the advance being paid by the tax preparer or tax software company (collectively, the "Tax Providers") to the lenders that offer this product.  TRS offered its new EA tax credit product during the first quarter of 2016. The EA product had the following features during the period it was offered through February 29, 2016:  � An advance amount of $750 per taxpayer customer;  � No fee for the EA charged to the taxpayer customer;  � All fees for the product were paid by the Tax Providers with a restriction prohibiting the Tax Providers from passing along the fees to the taxpayer customer;  � No requirement that the taxpayer customer pay for another bank product, such as an RT;  Table of Contents  � Multiple funds disbursement methods, including direct deposit, prepaid card, check or the Walmart Direct2Cash(R) product, based on the taxpayer customer's election;  � Repayment to the Bank was deducted from the taxpayer customer's tax refund proceeds; and  � If an insufficient refund to repay the EA occurred:  o there was no recourse to the taxpayer customer,  o no negative credit reporting on the taxpayer customer, and  o no collection efforts against the taxpayer customer.  Fees paid by the Tax Providers to the Company for the EA product are reported as interest income on loans. EAs during the first quarter of 2016 were generally repaid within three weeks after the taxpayer customer's tax return was submitted to the applicable tax authority. Unpaid EAs are generally charged-off within 81 days after the taxpayer customer's tax return is submitted to the applicable tax authority, with the majority of charge-offs expected to occur in the second quarter of 2016.  TRS originated $123 million in EAs during the first quarter of 2016 and reported $5.2 million of interest income under the line item "Loans, including fees." Income on EAs was partially offset by a $3.6 million provision for loss on EAs. The provision for loss on EAs equated to 2.90% of total EA originations for the quarter. The Company based its provision for loss on EAs on prior year IRS funding patterns with adjustments based on current year IRS funding patterns. At March 31, 2016, $4 million in EAs remained outstanding past their expected funding date from the IRS, with an allowance for loss of approximately $3 million against this remaining balance.  See additional detail regarding the EA product under Footnote 4 "Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" of Part I Item 1 "Financial Statements."  Republic Payment Solutions division - The RPS division is an issuing bank offering general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards through third party program managers. For the projected near-term, as the prepaid card program matures, the operating results of the RPS division are expected to be immaterial to the Company's overall results of operations and will be reported as part of the RPG segment. The RPS division will not be reported as a separate segment until such time, if any, that it meets reporting thresholds.  Republic Credit Solutions division - The RCS division offers short-term consumer credit products. In general, the credit products are unsecured, small dollar consumer loans with maturities of 30 days-or-more, and are dependent on various factors including the consumer's ability to repay.  During the third quarter of 2015, one of RCS' small-dollar consumer loan programs moved beyond the program's pilot phase. Under the operation of this program, the Company retains a 10% ownership in the loans originated and sells a 90% participation interest. During the first quarter of 2016, RPG sold approximately $44 million of loans from this program to a third party compared to $2 million during the first quarter of 2015.
