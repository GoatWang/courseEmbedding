Touchstone Enters into Purchase Agreement to Acquire Certain Assets of Sentinel Asset Management, Inc.
CINCINNATI – Apr. 19, 2017 – Touchstone Investments and Sentinel Asset Management, Inc. (Sentinel), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of National Life Holding Company, announced today that Touchstone Advisors, Inc. (Touchstone), a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Financial Group (Western & Southern), has agreed to acquire certain assets relating to Sentinel’s business of providing investment advisory and investment management services to the Sentinel mutual funds.
The acquisition is expected to increase Touchstone’s assets under management to $20 billion.
Sentinel currently manages 11 mutual fund strategies with combined assets under management of $5.54 billion as of Feb. 28, 2017.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, nine Sentinel retail funds and four Sentinel variable products funds will be reorganized into either existing Touchstone funds or into newly created Touchstone funds, and after the reorganizations, the funds will be advised by Touchstone.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Small Company and International Equity Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone funds that will be managed by the current Sentinel teams as part of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc.’s (Fort Washington) team of investment professionals. Fort Washington is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern. The Sentinel Common Stock Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Jamie Wilhelm, managing director and head of Public Equities at Fort Washington. Wilhelm and his team currently manage the Touchstone Focused Fund. The Sentinel Balanced Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Timothy J. Policinski, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Fort Washington.
The Sentinel Government Securities, Total Return Bond, Low Duration Bond, Multi-Asset Income and Sustainable Core Opportunities Funds are expected to be reorganized into existing Touchstone funds that will continue to be managed by the existing Touchstone funds’ current investment professionals at Fort Washington, ClearArc Capital, Inc., and Rockefeller & Co., Inc.
The Sentinel Unconstrained Bond Fund is not included in the terms of the purchase agreement.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Variable Products Balanced, Bond, Common Stock and Small Company Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone variable series funds, in each case managed by investment professionals at Fort Washington.
Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the boards of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc., and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, as well as the approval of the shareholders of each applicable series of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc. and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, and is expected to be completed in late 2017. The board of trustees of the Touchstone funds has approved the transaction.
"Touchstone remains dedicated to its sub-advised mutual fund approach and is committed to offering investment products based on partnerships with premier money managers. This acquisition reflects Touchstone’s continued commitment to providing investors with access to best-in-class institutional money managers through its mutual funds," said Steven M. Graziano, president of Touchstone Investments. “We also believe strongly in the value that financial advisors provide to the private client and institutional marketplace. As such, Touchstone distributes its funds through third-party intermediaries like registered investment advisors, private banks and consultants, as well as through national, regional and independent broker-dealers."
"We believe that our Sentinel fund shareholders will be well served by the Touchstone family," said Mehran Assadi, president and CEO of National Life Group. "Touchstone’s deep commitment to the retail mutual fund business, its investment strategies and shareholder services are very much in line with those of Sentinel. Touchstone will be a good home for our fund shareholders."
Berkshire Capital Securities LLC and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP are advising Sentinel on the transaction.

Full Press Release
 
Proposed Reorganizations of Sentinel Funds into Touchstone Funds
On April 19, 2017, Touchstone Advisors, Inc. ("Touchstone") and Sentinel Asset Management, Inc. ("Sentinel") announced that they had entered into a purchase agreement whereby Touchstone would acquire certain assets relating to Sentinel's business of providing investment advisory and investment management services to the Sentinel mutual funds. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, nine retail Sentinel mutual funds (the "Sentinel Funds") will be reorganized into either existing Touchstone funds or into newly created Touchstone funds.
The following Q & A is intended to provide additional information regarding the proposed reorganizations of the Sentinel Funds.
Download FAQs



What is being proposed?


Sentinel, the current investor advisor of the Sentinel Funds, informed the Sentinel Funds Board of its intent to exit the mutual fund advisory business. Sentinel engaged an investment bank to help identify parties interested in acquiring Sentinel’s mutual fund advisory business. As a result of that search, Sentinel entered into an agreement to sell its mutual fund advisory business to Touchstone (the "Transaction"), investment advisor to the Touchstone family of mutual funds (the "Touchstone Funds"). In connection with the Transaction, Sentinel recommended and the Sentinel Funds Board approved the integration of each of the Sentinel Target Funds identified below into a Touchstone Fund. At a Special Meeting of Shareholders expected to be held in August 2017, shareholders of each Sentinel Target Fund will be asked to vote on a proposal to reorganize their Sentinel Fund into a Touchstone Fund with a similar investment goal and principal investment policies (each, a "Reorganization" and collectively, the "Reorganizations").

 

Which Sentinel Funds are involved in the Reorganizations?


It is proposed that each Sentinel Target Fund identified below will be reorganized into the corresponding Touchstone Acquiring Fund, subject in each case to the approval of the Sentinel Fund’s shareholders:

How do the fees and expenses of the Funds compare?


Touchstone has contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses in order to maintain the total annual operating expense ratio for each class of shares of a Touchstone Acquiring Fund to an amount no greater than the total annual operating expense ratio of the corresponding share class of each Sentinel Target Fund for the Target Funds’ most recent fiscal year (after giving effect to any expense limitation in effect for the Sentinel Target Funds). This contractual expense limitation will remain in place for a period of at least two years from the closing date of the Reorganizations. Absent this expense limitation, the pro forma total annual fund operating expense ratio of certain classes of certain of the Touchstone Acquiring Funds may be higher than the total annual fund operating expense ratio before any waivers and reimbursements of the corresponding class of the corresponding Sentinel Target Fund.

 

How do the Funds’ investment goals and principal investment strategies compare?


Although each Sentinel Target Fund and the corresponding Touchstone Acquiring Fund have similar investment goals and principal investment strategies, there are some differences. In addition, the analytical tools, techniques and investment selection process used by the sub-advisors of the Touchstone Acquiring Funds to select investments may be different from those used by Sentinel.

Who will manage the Touchstone Acquiring Funds after the Reorganizations?


Touchstone currently serves as the investment advisor to the existing Touchstone Funds and will serve as the investment advisor to each newly created Touchstone Acquiring Fund. Touchstone employs or will employ a sub-advisor to provide portfolio management services to each Touchstone Acquiring Fund. The sub-advisors are overseen by Touchstone and ultimately by the Board of Trustees of Touchstone Strategic Trust and Touchstone Funds Group Trust. The Sentinel Target Funds are currently managed by Sentinel and do not employ sub-advisors.
With respect to the Touchstone Acquiring Funds into which the Sentinel International Equity Fund and Sentinel Small Company Fund will be reorganized, Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc. has been appointed as sub-advisor, and the current portfolio management teams at Sentinel are expected to remain in place after the Reorganizations as employees of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc. For all other Sentinel Target Funds, the portfolio management team will change following the Reorganizations.

 

How do the performance records of the Sentinel Target Funds and the Touchstone Acquiring Funds compare?


The Touchstone Balanced Fund, Touchstone International Equity Fund, Touchstone Large Cap Focused Fund, and Touchstone Small Company Fund are newly formed funds (the "adopted funds") and have no performance history. Those Touchstone Acquiring Funds will adopt the performance history of the corresponding Sentinel Target Fund noted above. Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc. ("Fort Washington") has been appointed as sub-advisor to each of these adopted funds, and with respect to the Touchstone International Equity Fund and the Touchstone Small Company Fund, the current portfolio management teams at Sentinel are expected to remain in place after the Reorganizations as employees of Fort Washington.

The following table sets forth composite performance data relating to the historical performance of all accounts managed by Fort Washington for the periods indicated with investment objectives, policies, strategies, and risks substantially similar to those of the Touchstone Large Cap Focused Fund. The data is provided to illustrate the past performance of the sub-advisor in managing substantially similar accounts and does not represent the performance of the Touchstone Funds.

The Large Cap Focused Equity Composite, which is managed by Fort Washington, represents the investment performance track record of Fort Washington’s large cap focused equity strategy, which is the strategy that will be used to manage the Touchstone Large Cap Focused Fund. The accounts comprising the Large Cap Focused Equity Composite are not subject to the same types of expenses to which the Touchstone Large Cap Focused Fund is subject, certain investment limitations, diversification requirements, and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Thus, the performance results for the Large Cap Focused Equity Composite could have been adversely affected if the account had been regulated as an investment company under federal securities and tax laws.
Fort Washington’s Large Cap Focused Equity Composite (the "Composite") returns are net of actual fees and expenses and reflect the reinvestment of all income. Actual fees are not reflective of the expenses of the Touchstone Funds and may vary depending on, among other things, the applicable fee schedule and portfolio size. All returns are expressed in U.S. dollars. Past performance of the Composite is not indicative of future results. As with any investment there is always the potential for gains as well as the possibility of losses.
The remainder of the Sentinel Target Funds (the "merged funds") will be reorganized into the corresponding Touchstone Acquired Fund noted above and will adopt the performance history of the corresponding Touchstone Fund. Past performance of the Sentinel Target Funds and the Touchstone Acquiring Funds, before and after taxes, does not necessarily represent how the Funds will perform in the future.

Updated performance information for the Sentinel Target Funds is available on the Sentinel Target Funds’ website at www.SentinelInvestments.com or by calling 800.282.3863. Updated performance information for the Touchstone Active Bond Fund, the Touchstone Flexible Income Fund, the Touchstone Sustainability and Impact Equity Fund, and the Touchstone Ultra Short Duration Fixed Income Fund is available on the Acquiring Fund’s website at www.TouchstoneInvestments.com or by calling 800.638.8194.

 

Will there be federal income taxes as a result of my Target Fund’s Reorganization?


Each Reorganization is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, shareholders are not expected to recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a direct result of the exchange of Sentinel Target Fund shares for shares of the corresponding Touchstone Acquiring Fund in a Sentinel Target Fund’s Reorganization. However, shareholders may receive a higher level of taxable distributions as a result of the Reorganization. Prior to the closing of each Reorganization, the Sentinel Target Fund may distribute all of its net investment income and net capital gains, if any. All or a portion of such distribution may be taxable to shareholders of such Sentinel Target Fund and will generally be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains for federal income tax purposes, unless a shareholder is investing through a tax-advantaged account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan (in which case such shareholder may be taxed upon withdrawal of its investment from such account). The tax character of such distributions will be the same regardless of whether they are paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares.
In addition, a significant portion of the portfolio securities of each Sentinel Target Fund, other than Sentinel International Equity Fund and Sentinel Small Company Fund, are expected to be sold following the Reorganization. To the extent that portfolio investments received by a Touchstone Acquiring Fund from a Sentinel Target Fund in a Reorganization are sold after the Reorganization, the Touchstone Acquiring Fund may recognize gains or losses, which may result in taxable distributions to shareholders holding shares of the Touchstone Acquiring Fund (including former Sentinel Target Fund shareholders who hold shares of the Touchstone Acquiring Fund following the Reorganization). The sub-advisors may take steps to limit the amount of capital gains recognized during a single fiscal year including by executing the portfolio repositioning over a period of time.

 

Will there be any sales load, commission or other similar fees in connection with the Reorganization?


No, Sentinel Fund shareholders will not pay any sales load, commission or other similar fee in connection with the receipt of Touchstone Acquiring Fund shares in the Reorganization, and otherwise applicable investment minimums will not apply with regard to the acquisition of Touchstone Acquiring Fund shares in a Reorganization.

 

What if a shareholder redeems Sentinel Target Fund shares before the Reorganization takes place?


If a Sentinel Fund shareholder redeems Sentinel Target Fund shares before the Reorganization takes place, then the redemption will be treated as a normal sale of shares and, generally, will be a taxable transaction and may be subject to any applicable redemption fee of the Sentinel Target Fund.

 

Who will pay the costs of the Reorganizations?


Touchstone and Sentinel or their respective affiliates will pay the costs of the Reorganizations (other than portfolio repositioning costs), including the costs relating to the Special Meeting of Shareholders and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The costs of the Reorganizations (other than portfolio repositioning costs) will not be borne by the Funds or the shareholders.

 

When will the Reorganizations occur?


Sentinel Fund shareholders will be asked to vote on the Reorganizations at the Special Meeting of Shareholders expected to be held in August 2017. The Reorganizations are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

 

Where can I find more information with respect to the Reorganizations?


Additional information regarding the Reorganizations will be contained in solicitation materials (including a Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus) that will be mailed to Sentinel Fund shareholders during summer 2017.

Shares of the Touchstone Funds are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Forward-Looking Statements
