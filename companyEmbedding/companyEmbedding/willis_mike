Revenue Enhancement Products
The goal of revenue enhancement products is to make money for you. Our activities are totally self-financing to you and your clients.
We:differentiate the clients' product and/or serviceadd additional product featuresadd additional revenue streamsincrease margin on existing productsincrease customer retention.Extended Warranty
Sold by: Retailers and Motor/Brown and White Goods Manufacturers
An extended warranty provides coverage against the mechanical and electrical breakdown of a product, extending the time period of the original manufacturers' warranty. The premium payable by the customer is structured so that the seller earns a commission, the administrator earns a fee per policy and the underwriter receives the net amount.
Home Emergency
Sold by: Utility Companies, Banks, Finance Providers
Home emergency insurance provides the customer with coverage for immediate and long-term home maintenance problems including, home security, central heating, glazing, roofing, water, electrical, plumbing, sewerage, pipes and drains etc.
Product Enhancement - Personal Lines
Sold by: Various companies with large customer bases
Most companies have some form of customer database that can collate a variety of useful customer information.
Companies with large databases have identified they are in a unique position to offer additional products to their customers, thereby earning sales commissions, profit shares and underwriting profits.
These products include insurance policies such as household, motor, travel, personal accident, life, private health, child care, pet and wedding.
Creditor Insurance
Sold by: Retailers, Motor Manufacturers, Mortgage and Finance Providers, Credit/Charge Card Providers
Creditor insurance offers protection to individuals committed to paying regular instalments for goods or services. The policy will take over repayments in the event of death, accident, sickness, critical illness or unemployment. We can structure coverage to provide any one or a group of these covers. We design the premium payable by the customer so the seller earns a commission, the administrator earns a fee per policy and the underwriter receives the net premium amount.

Cries from the Classroom



Mike Willis — 20 min. Moderator and 7 voices, either M or F. ‘Voices,’ victims of school violence appear and tell their stories. The play’s remedial suggestions for the prevention of violence in schools are by no means comprehensive. It is essential that a respect for human life and the importance of positive role models is highlighted as the theme of this play.

Meet the Legend
 
Michael Willis is 31 years old and is coming to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the founder and owner of Bone Squad Outdoors. Michael did not start hunting till his early twenties but became a bow hunting addict soon as he stepped into the woods with a bow and has not looked back since. Michael took it upon himself to learn how to hunt successfully as he was not brought up by a hunting family. Michael constantly spent time in the field studying and by way of trial and error he became a very successful hunter.
When Michael is not hunting he is scouting, planning, and preparing 365 days a year. It is safe to say there is not a day that goes by that Michael does not do something related to hunting. He is privileged to be able to hunt all over and is very passionate about capturing every hunting adventure on film, as well as sharing his outdoor experiences with friends and family. Michael was raised on strong Christian Beliefs and continues to have a personal relationship with God and believes through him all things are possible.

In 2010 a dream became a reality. That dream was Bone Squad Outdoors. Bone Squad Outdoors is an outdoor media and production team that was founded and is based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The main focus of Bone Squad Outdoors is producing innovative photography and video with cutting edge twists that is not often seen. Bone Squad Outdoors possesses Passion, Drive and 100% determination to stay true to ourselves and create an image that is unique and found only with Bone Squad Outdoors. We live by the saying “Create and Captivate” in all that we do a field and life.
No matter where we end up were always reminded of the true meaning that brought us together and where we are today. With work, time away, and life’s obstacles it’s easy to lose focus on what matters the most to us which is Family, Friends and Supporters. Without them none of this would be possible and for that we are truly grateful.
Bone Squad Outdoors travels the country in hopes of bringing the best Whitetail and Spring Gobbler footage possible. We strive on capturing every moment from the hilarious to the intense. Along the way we will entertain you with our true passion for Big Bucks and Long Beards!
Bone Squad Outdoors is a tight knit group of seriously driven hunters that are all about fair chase. They take it upon themselves as part of the sport to scout public and private grounds, obtain permission on privately owned land and farms. These men by no means are amateur hunters. Bone Squad Outdoors may just be a group of backwoods men now, but they show no fear, an unmatched passion for the outdoors, and are ready to show the hunting world what they are really made of.
