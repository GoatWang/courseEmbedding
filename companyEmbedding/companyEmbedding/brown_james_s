Kate Moss cuts off cash as best friend James Brown's hair firm founders

Updated:
  18:47 EDT, 12 June 2010

















 
          26
View  comments



Kate Moss has rejected a plea from her childhood best friend, 
celebrity hairdresser James Brown, to save his struggling business.
The supermodel helped him launch his first London salon a year ago by
 appearing in a documentary about it.
But despite the A-list endorsement, one of Brown’s three companies – 
his hair-care product range – has gone into administration, and the 
others are in serious financial trouble.
 




Tough times: Kate Moss and James Brown at the launch of his haircare range in 2007James, 40, turned to millionaire Kate again, but she has refused to do any more.Sources say the business is now being kept afloat by a £3million cash injection from Lynne Murphy, mother of Kate’s best friend, Davinia Taylor.

A source said: ‘James’s business is really struggling. He asked Kate 
if she would put some money in but she feels she has done enough 
already.
‘James is very upset because he believes in his products – but there 
is no more money in the pot.’
Companies House records show that James’s company, James Brown 
Hair Care Ltd, owes its investors £3,602,824.
Lynne Murphy is shown as a company creditor. James’s London salon is 
still open for business.
Although James and Kate, 36, have been friends for years, they have 
had fallings-out over the business.
Last year I told of Kate’s annoyance that what was supposed to be a 
cameo role in the E4 documentary about his salon opening had turned into
 a starring one.A source close to James said: ‘This has come as a real 
blow for James. He had plans to open another salon in New York and make 
the brand bigger.’A spokesman for James said: ‘Kate has been very supportive throughout 
and more than generous. The administration has nothing whatsoever to do

Overview



If you don't have access to the dozens of James Brown compilations in the United States or Japan, this Universal U.K. collection may be just the thing to get you up offa that thang. Given that they own virtually all of the James Brown masters, we can be assured that these versions of his best-known material are first recordings as opposed to the many dodgy live boots out there from fly-by-night labels attempting to cash in as well as deceive fans. This one is strictly legit. There are 18 cuts on this monster; rather than concentrating on being representative of Brown's long career, this disc touches on his soul years but goes deeper into representing the development of the funk we all love him for. "Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine" and "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" precede "Try Me," "Please Please Please," and "It's a Man's Man's Man's World." Other material here includes the killer versions of "Body Heat" and "The Payback," with plenty in between. Unfortunately, "Mother Popcorn" is missing, but that's OK because "Hot Pants," "Night Train," and both parts of "Funky Drummer" are here. In other words, this is a great place to get started for the novice, and a killer mix CD for the devoted fan.

Clyde Stubblefield, James Brown's one-time drummer and the creator of one of hip-hop's most popular samples, has died at the age of 73. Stubblefield's wife, Jody Hannon, confirmed the drummer's death to Rolling Stone. The cause of death was kidney failure.Related










James Brown: Most Sampled Man in the Biz

        A list of songs that sample from James Brown
      



"The Funky Funkiest Drummer Of All Time," Questlove wrote on Saturday. "Clyde Stubblefield thank you for everything you've taught me. The spirit of the greatest grace note left hand snare drummer will live on thru all of us."Stubblefield, while a member of Brown's backing unit, performed on the funk legend's classic cuts like "Cold Sweat," "Ain't It Funky Now," "I Got the Feelin'" and Brown's landmark LP Cold Sweat and Sex Machine.However, it's a 20-second drum break, a snippet of a Stubblefield solo found on Brown's 1970 single for "Funky Drummer," that marked the drummer's biggest impact on music.The drum break served as the backbeat for countless hip-hop tracks, ranging from Public Enemy's "Fight the Power," "Bring the Noise" and "Rebel Without a Pause" to N.W.A's "Fuck tha Police" and Dr. Dre's "Let Me Ride" to LL Cool J's "Mama Said Knock You Out," Run-D.M.C.'s "Run's House" and Beastie Boys' "Shadrach." Even Ed Sheeran's "Shirtsleeves" and George Michael's "Freedom '90" were among the over 1,000 songs to sample Stubblefield's beat. "We were sitting up in the studio, getting ready for a session, and I guess when I got set up I just started playing a pattern. Started playing something," Stubblefield said of creating the famous drum break. "The bassline came in and the guitar came in and we just had a rhythm going, and if Brown liked it, I just said, 'Well, I'll put something with it.'"Stubblefield was not listed as a songwriter on the track and therefore didn't see much royalties from the decades of sampling."All the drum patterns I played with Brown was my own; he never told me how to play or what to play," Stubblefield told SF Weekly in 2012. "I just played my own patterns, and the hip-hoppers and whatever, the people that used the material probably paid him, maybe. But we got nothing. I got none of it. It was all my drum product."Stubblefield added in a 2011 New York Times interview, "People use my drum patterns on a lot of these songs. They never gave me credit, never paid me. It didn't bug me or disturb me, but I think it’s disrespectful not to pay people for what they use."Born in Chattanooga in 1943, Stubblefield served as a session musician and toured under Otis Redding before becoming Brown's drummer from 1965 to 1971. During his tenure with Brown, he partnered with drummer John "Jabo" Starks to form the powerhouse rhythm section that helped write the definition of funk music. In 2016, Rolling Stone placed the Stubblefield/Starks combo as Number Six on the list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time. "Starks was the Beatles to Clyde's Stones. A clean shuffle drummer to Clyde's free-jazz left hand," Questlove told Rolling Stone for the feature."You have to understand this: We're two different drummers," Starks told NPR in 2015. "Clyde plays the way that Clyde plays, which, nobody's gonna play like Clyde. I play like I play. We can play the same tune, but different ways. You never played together on James' shows, but when he wanted to hear something different from Clyde, he'd point to me."Years after Stubblefield left Brown's band, he and Starks reunited to form the Funkmasters, resulting in a pair of albums as well as an instructional video. Stubblefield, a resident of Madison, Wisconsin since the early Seventies, also released a handful of solo albums, including 1997's Revenge of the Funky Drummer.In recent years, Stubblefield dealt with numerous health issues: In 2002, he had a kidney removed, and he suffered from end-stage renal disease in the last decade. While Stubblefield did not have health insurance, in April 2016, Stubblefield revealed that Prince secretly paid the $90,000 in medical bills the drummer accumulated while undergoing chemotherapy for bladder cancer. Prince considered Stubblefield one of his "drumming idols," Stubblefield told Billboard following Prince's death."We lost another Pillar Stone that held up the Foundation of Funk," Bootsy Collins, who performed with Stubblefield on Sex Machine, wrote on Facebook Saturday. "Mr. Clyde Stubblefield has left our frequency. I am lost for words & Rythme right now. Dang Clyde! U taught me so much as I stood their watchin' over u & "Jabo" while keepin' one eye on the Godfather. We all loved U so much."

When Soul Music MatteredThis collection of female talent from the world of James Brown proves that not only was the godfather a genius when it came to his own music, but he was also a master as a talent scout. This 2 CD set spotlights a baker's dozen of Brown's finds with star making turns from each. Particularly impressive is Lyn Collins with an album's worth of funk gems here, as well as the amazing Vicki Anderson who, based on the evidence here, should've been a major star. If you love classic soul music, you need this CD.By recordchanger (Kettering, Ohio)

hello


















      Below are just a few of the eye popping routines that have helped earn James a very good living and the coveted title of "Magic Circle Close Up Magician of the Year 2006!"It's now time to take your performance to the next levelBrainless Travellers - The routine James wanted to keep to himself! Two piles of ten cards...the spectator merely THINKS of a card from one of the piles...it immediately vanishes from this pile...only nine remain...the second pile is counted...there are eleven...the thought of card is shown to have travelled across...But Wait... another spectator thought of a different card...NO PROBLEM! With just a click of the fingers and without even touching the piles... the piles are counted (by the spectators) and one pile now contains only eight cards and the other twelve! The second card has now travelled across!Now get this no gimmicked cards, no setup and the best part it can all be done with a borrowed deck!Signed Card to Sealed Envelope - This is not your standard Signed Card to Sealed Envelope; it's all done by the spectator! A signed card vanishes from your spectator's possession and impossibly reappears in a sealed envelope held by the very same spectator!Psychological Deck Vanish - The ultimate solution to the "Show me a trick!" request that will blow them away! The deck vanishes from between yours and the spectator's hands, leaving nothing but their previously thought of card!Card Under Box - The classic effect with some great new twists! See James perform this in all the "wrong" situations and successfully blow people away! Repeat card under box, deck under box & optional vanish! This is a great lesson in misdirection as James proves that with the right thinking, you CAN do this anywhere! Card Under Watch - This one gets people talking! When a spectator finds their signed card folded & wedged snugly under their watch, they literally freak out! James has routined this in such a way that the spectator's will NEVER be able to backtrack the load. A fantastic lesson in time misdirection!Fancy a Pot of Jam? - Pitching & loading for the real world! This effect takes a simple coin trick and gives it an ending that is so surreal that it will be remembered for a very long time! James begins with "The World Famous 11p Trick" & ends it with a mind blowing production of a pot of jam.Cards Opener - A brilliant routine combining the best elements of card Magic, to create an action packed showpiece that is ideal to begin your set with. Cards to pocket, card changes and a deck vanish make this something to really show you mean business when you have a deck of cards!

			does not worth a single penny
			


			Posted by Tom A. Kuster
		
I was very disappointed because I loved this James coat and its look. I paid $189 for this attire, and it does not worth a single penny I discard on the coat and its shipment.

 

			My Feedback 
			


			Posted by Paul (Huston)
		
Ordered it last week and came yesterday. Today is the day I’ll send you my feedbacks and it goes something like this. First I’ll talk about the correspondence with the seller which was good. She replied on time and helped me out big time in my suit measurements. That turned out good and that’s how I got this suit with me. Now about the suit, it is very comfortable and fitting. It just went well and I can’t be happier. Since I have good terms now with the seller, I’ll come for another. Maybe suit or jacket. Thanks a lot.
