InMotion WRIST™
The InMotion WRIST is an evidence based and research proven interactive rehabilitation device that senses patient movements and limitations, and provides assistance-as-needed™. It can accommodate the range of motion of a normal wrist in everyday tasks and can be used by clinicians as a stand-alone treatment option or in addition to the InMotion ARM. The InMotion WRIST enables clinicians to efficiently deliver optimum intensive sensorimotor wrist and forearm therapy to patients with neurological conditions. The InMotion WRIST has been sold in over 20 countries, including the United States for rehabilitation. Extensive research has shown it to be effective, especially for stroke and cerebral palsy.

InMotion HAND™













	Products
 



The InMotion HAND is an add-on module to be used with the InMotion ARM™. The two work together to provide assist-as-needed™ support for reaching with grasp and release movements, or independently for focused training on individual hand movements. It allows clinicians to efficiently deliver optimum intensive sensorimotor therapy to the hand to achieve the development of new neural pathways. The InMotion HAND has been sold in over 20 countries, including the United States for rehabilitation. Extensive research has shown it to be effective, especially for stroke and cerebral palsy.

Overview













	Products
 


Bionik’s suite of robotic rehabilitation products are the result of groundbreaking medical engineering research and development at the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Our systems have been tested by leading medical centers in dozens of controlled clinical trials, including large randomized controlled clinical studies. Through our research, we have discovered that the best way to optimize robot therapy is by allowing the robots to focus on reducing impairments and allowing the therapist to assist on translating the gains in impairment into function.
Bionik’s modular systems approach to neurorehabilitation is the only system designed to optimize the use of robotics in a manner that is consistent with the latest clinical research and neuroscience, taking into account the latest understanding on motor learning interference and motor memory consolidation.
Clinical Results
In a multi-center, randomized controlled trial involving 127 chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe upper-limb impairment, our assist-as-needed™ therapy demonstrated significant improvement in arm movement, function and quality of life. The study also found that “the improvements provide evidence of potential long-term benefits of rehabilitation and challenge the widely held clinical belief that gains in motor function are not possible for long term stroke survivors.”1
In a controlled clinical study involving 56 stroke inpatients, the motor skills of the robot-treated group improved significantly more than the control group. Analysis showed that interactive robotic therapy significantly reduced motor impairment of the treated limbs, doubling the impairment reduction.2
A multi-center VA study of 127 patients with long-term severe to moderate upper-limb impairment from a stroke that occurred at least 6 months before enrollment (average time of 4.7 years, 33% with multiple strokes) found that “the improvements provide evidence of potential long-term benefits of rehabilitation and challenge the widely held clinical belief that gains in motor function are not possible for long term stroke survivors.”
Technology
Our robotic products have exceptional capacity for measurement and immediate interactive response, which sets them apart from other therapy systems.

Senses the patient’s movement and responds to a patient’s continually-changing ability
Robots guide the exercise treatment accordingly

If the patient is unable to move, the robot gently assists the patient to initiate movement towards the target
If coordination is a problem, the robot “guides” the movement, allowing the patient to move towards the target and making certain that the patient is practicing the movement the correct way
As the patient gains movement control, the robot provides less assistance and continually challenges the patient




Provides quantifiable feedback on progress and performance

Bionik Laboratories and Wistron Corporation Partner to Develop Exoskeleton Technologies for Consumer Medical Device Market

Joint development project pairs expertise of both companies to produce low-price, lower-body assistive robotic products for the consumer home market




Jun 26, 2017, 9:16am EDT














TORONTO and BOSTON, June 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bionik Laboratories Corp. (OTCQX:BNKL) ("Bionik" or the "Company"), a robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation and assistive technology solutions to individuals with neurological and mobility challenges from hospital to home, today announced a joint development project (the "Agreement") with Wistron Corporation (TPE:3231) ("Wistron"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the two companies will partner to design, engineer, and manufacture low-price, lower-body assistive robotic technologies for mass commercial sale within the consumer home products market.
The companies plan to base the new consumer exoskeleton products off Bionik's ARKE lower body exoskeleton, currently in clinical development for use within rehabilitation environments, as well as incorporating other important intellectual property relating to Bionik's acquired or licensed assistive robotic technologies. The companies intend to target the Asian market initially, where the aging/elderly population is projected to hit 983 million by 2050, increasing the need for affordable assistive technologies over the next half century.
Wistron, which designs and manufactures technology products for global distribution with annual revenue exceeding $20 billion, will co-develop with Bionik a consumer exoskeleton product, which will be sold under the Bionik brand name and at a price point so they can be more widely available to the mass consumer market. 
"Wistron is a highly significant organization within the manufacturing industry, so having an opportunity to combine our industry-leading expertise within the robotics industry with their product development resources is incredible for us," said Peter Bloch, Chief Executive Officer of Bionik. "Our years of experience in medical robotics has provided us with strong clinical data and technology to help us access this growing market of robotics technologies in the area of human assistance. We intend to continue to seek out additional partnerships that will allow us to bring our technology to a mass audience within the consumer products sector."
The medical robotics market is projected to be worth $12.8B by 2021, up from $4.9B in 2016, according to a recent report. This provides a significant opportunity for Bionik to partner with larger manufacturers and provide technical expertise to develop products for distribution at larger scale within a high growth market.
The industry has seen a rise of robotics and smart technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning within the medical field, but much of that innovation is within a clinical setting. As such, there exists a tremendous opportunity for disruption within the consumer space, as Bionik does not believe that there are currently options that are both viable and affordable. 
Wistron is one of the world's largest original design manufacturers, and has worked with some of the world's largest companies to design and manufacture consumer technology products and bring them to market. Upon completion of the design of any new product conceived within the framework of the Agreement, Wistron would be the sole manufacturer.
"This partnership with Wistron represents a tremendous opportunity for Bionik to bring our technology to a massive consumer audience. When it comes to the commercialization of consumer tech products – design, engineering, and manufacturing – Wistron is a leader," said Michal Prywata, co-founder and COO of Bionik. "Our leading robotic technologies are already available in more than 200 facilities across the globe, but this partnership with Wistron will allow us to provide access to a much larger consumer market."   
About Wistron
Wistron Corporation (TPE:3231) is a Fortune Global 500 company and a Technology Service Provider supplying ICT (information and communication technology) products, services, and systems to our global customers. Wistron is devoted to increasing the value of its services through developing innovative solutions in the areas of green recycling, cloud, and display vertical integration.
