Lakewood Capital Releases Detailed Presentation On Select Income REIT And Issues Open Letter To Shareholders

		  Highlights Governance Concerns and Share Price Underperformance at SIRIntends to Seek the Election of its Highly Qualified Nominee to SIR's Board of Trustees at 2015 Annual Meeting of ShareholdersExpresses Concerns That SIR Is Seeking to Accelerate Record Date for 2015 Annual Meeting

NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lakewood Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, "Lakewood"), the second largest unaffiliated shareholder of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company") (NYSE:   SIR) with current ownership of approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of SIR, today announced that it has filed a detailed presentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  In the presentation, Lakewood outlines its concerns with SIR's governance and the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR").  The presentation also includes detailed information regarding the vast qualifications of Lakewood's nominee for election to SIR's Board of Trustees, William H. Lenehan.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated Mr. Lenehan, a real estate executive with significant public company experience, for election to the Board of Trustees at SIR's 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Lakewood firmly believes that Mr. Lenehan's election as a Trustee would give shareholders a voice towards improving the Company's corporate governance and share price performance.  As set forth in more detail in the presentation, Lakewood believes that with proper governance improvements, SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of over 50% above recent trading levels.
Lakewood's detailed presentation is available at the SEC's website and can be viewed by clicking the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Additionally, Lakewood announced today it has delivered an open letter to SIR shareholders, the full text of which follows:
January 14, 2015
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Funds managed by Lakewood Capital Management, LP ("Lakewood") currently own in the aggregate approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company").  We are long-term SIR shareholders, having owned shares since the days immediately following the Company's initial public offering in March 2012.  Like many of you, we have grown frustrated with the poor governance at SIR that we believe has led to the stock's significant discount to net asset value and dramatic underperformance over the past year.  We believe this remarkably low stock valuation and significant share price underperformance is a direct result of governance concerns resulting from the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR"), and a Board of Trustees that has not duly protected the interests of shareholders.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated William H. Lenehan, a highly qualified real estate executive with significant public company experience, to the Board of Trustees to give shareholders a voice and improve the Company's governance.   
Earlier today, we filed a detailed presentation with the SEC that is available on the SEC's website at the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Specifically, our presentation outlines the following:

Our belief that SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of 50% above recent trading levels. 
How SIR's stock trades at a deep discount to its net asset value and has dramatically underperformed its peers due, we believe, to widely-held concerns around corporate governance. 
The misalignment of interests due to SIR's external management structure in which RMR receives fees almost entirely based off of the size of the assets of the Company, as opposed to SIR's share price performance. 
Several recent actions taken by the Board of Trustees that have only served to deepen investor mistrust. 
Our belief that shareholders will benefit meaningfully from enhanced governance and greater accountability. 
The vast qualifications of William H. Lenehan, our nominee to the Board of Trustees and an accomplished real estate executive who can help improve governance at SIR.
RECORD DATE
Please note that we have been advised that SIR has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of a Wednesday, January 21, 2015 record date for the SIR 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting").  For comparison, this date is 48 days earlier in the year than expected based on last year's record date of March 10, 2014 for the 2014 Annual Meeting.  We have serious concerns that the acceleration of the record date will disenfranchise certain shareholders with respect to the election of trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
IMPORTANTLY, IF SIR SETS JANUARY 21, 2015 AS THE RECORD DATE FOR THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING, ANY SHARES MUST BE PURCHASED FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BY THE END OF TRADING ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2015 (ALLOWING FOR A THREE DAY SETTLEMENT PERIOD) TO BE ENTITLED TO BE VOTED AT THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.  FURTHERMORE, SIR SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CALL THEIR BROKER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SHARES ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING LENT OUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SHARES ARE IN THEIR BROKER'S POSSESSION AND CAN BE VOTED AT THE SIR 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.
We look forward to communicating with you in more detail in the weeks to come regarding our serious concerns at SIR and the election of our highly qualified nominee to SIR's Board of Trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
Sincerely,
Anthony T. Bozza

Overview — Lakewood Capital





















































Overview








Lakewood Capital was formed in 2007 to team with operating management to
 make control investments in private companies active in the lower 
middle market. Lakewood targets businesses that have developed a strong 
position in their core markets and are facing 
opportunities/challenges/transition as they move toward the next stage 
of their developments. Lower middle market businesses often reach a 
point where their existing resources, be they financial, operational or 
human, need to be expanded, adjusted and/or reallocated to continue to 
prosper. These times often occur when founding management seeks less 
active involvement, new market opportunities arise, growth outstrips 
current capacity, and/or the competitive landscape changes. Lakewood 
prides itself on partnering with existing management to capitalize on 
these times of transition, with the mutual goal of building stronger, 
more dynamic, more competitive operations in the process. As such, we 
will not be focused on any particular industry but will look for 
opportunities where we have the ability to work with management, 
collectively, drawing on resources and experiences each party has 
developed over many years. Our strategic influence coupled with 
management’s operational expertise, brought together in a collaborative 
environment, has served us extremely well over the years, and we believe
 it will be even more critical over the next several years as the 
private equity market matures.
