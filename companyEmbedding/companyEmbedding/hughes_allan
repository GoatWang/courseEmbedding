PRODUCTS






Alan J. Hughes Custom Sawmilling produces lumber for building projects and decorative material, such as flooring and siding. We also produce wood for woodworkers and carvers. We maximize the useable material in your logs and salvage material in logs that might otherwise go to waste.









We also specialize in the sale of cedar lumber for decks, walls, siding, fencing, lawn furniture, picnic tables, and other uses. We are able to mill most cedar material that is requested by our customers.

We mill both hardwood and softwood logs of all shapes and sizes.
