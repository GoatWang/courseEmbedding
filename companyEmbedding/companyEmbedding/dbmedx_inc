				Introducing The			
Breakthrough, real-time clinical decision and patient monitoring devices.







				Products			


We have identified a number of indications that would benefit from an automated ultrasound measurement and from these indications we have selected our first two monitoring devices to develop which are closely integrated into our high level strategy.
 

BBS Revolution™ device

The BBS Revolution™ device, our first product, is an automated bladder volume measurement device. The BBS Revolution™ Scanner is a small, handheld device which is used to make a rapid, automated measurement of a patient’s bladder volume. The enhanced features of the BBS Revolution™ device will allow an easier and more rapid bladder measurement when compared with competing devices – while eliminating costly calibration and maintenance.

StatCVP™ Monitor
The StatCVP™ Monitor is a truly novel device that provides a noninvasive assessment of Central Venous Pressure and Total Blood Volume. The StatCVP™ Monitor utilizes the sophisticated dBMEDx ultrasound core to automatically monitor the 3D geometry of the inferior vena cava and aorta. The StatCVP™ Monitor is simple to use, incredibly powerful and will not only revolutionize the triage of critical care patients in the ER but is designed to be used beyond the hospital by any medical professional in any setting including EMTs, first responders and military field medics. The market for the StatCVP™ Monitor is significant, encompassing every hospital and EMS globally.

 dBMEDx Inc Closes Second Round of Funding 

Littleton, CO and Seattle, WA – Apr. 4, 2013 – dBMEDx™, Inc., a privately held automated
wireless medical device company, announces the closing of a fully subscribed capital raise of $1.1
million through a sale of common stock, the company’s second successful capital raise.
The proceeds will be used to complete development of the company’s first product, the
Benchmark Bladder System™, a fully automated and non-invasive bladder volume measurement
device utilizing the company’s hand-held scanning technology. Bladder volume measurement is
a well-established metric used in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of medical
conditions, including urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most common type of infection in
the body. UTI’s account for about 8.1 million visits to health-care providers each year and over
$1.6 billion in annual medical costs.
The dBMEDx product offers a number of advantages over competing devices, including a lower
total cost of ownership and improved ease of use.
“We are very pleased with the level of interest in dBMEDx™ as evidenced by the rapid closure of
our second round of funding,” said David Shine, CEO of dBMEDx™. “The company is now wellpositioned to bring the first device in our pipeline through FDA clearance and move toward initial
revenue.”
The annual market for automated bladder measurement devices is currently estimated at $150
million with a history of steady growth.
About dBMEDx™, Inc.
dBMEDx™ is a medical device company that is developing novel, automated scanning devices for a
wide range of medical applications. The company has developed the world’s smallest, completely
wireless 3D ultrasound scan engine with integrated image analysis technology. This device
architecture overcomes many of the limitations of traditional imaging technology to create
devices that can be used with very little training. The patented dBMEDx™ architecture
automatically collects and analyzes the image data and presents the user with a numeric result,
bringing the power and safety of ultrasound-based diagnosis to all medical professionals. For

Tech startup: dBMEDx Inc. By Eric Peterson






Published: 2013.07.22 03:10 AM


INITIAL LIGHT BULB Ultrasound expert Bill Barnard came up with a new scanner that’s easier for medical professionals to use and less invasive for patients. He teamed up with David Shine and Dr. Bill Quirk to launch dBMEDx.

	“Bill had worked for many years on a device that would detect the volume of a patient’s bladder,” says Shine. Barnard’s “creative architecture” became the linchpin of dBMEDx’s hand-held ultrasound technology.

	Shine serves as the CEO of dBMEDx while Barnard is the Seattle-based CTO, and Quirk functions as the company’s chief medical officer.

IN A NUTSHELL dBMEDx is making user-friendly, mobile ultrasound scanners that will first be used for bladder scans and then transitioned into a wide range of diagnostic applications.

	“I use ultrasound every day,” says Quirk, a physician at Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver and one of the original investors in iTriage. “In my world, ultrasound is operator-dependent” – meaning only doctors are qualified and cleared to use it.

	This isn’t the case with dBMEDx’s scanners, which can be used by technicians and emergency responders. ”We want to make it operator-independent,” says Quirk. “You don’t have to have M.D. or Ph.D. after your name to use it.”

	Echoes Shine: “That’s the power of this thing – it requires very little training and very little expertise.”

	More power comes in a seamless interface with iPads and other devices, resulting in significant improvements in productivity and efficiency, not to mention medical efficacy.

	With user-friendliness comes better treatment, as ambulance drivers are able to provide diagnostic data while en route to the hospital. “That data point gets beamed to the hospital,” says Quirk, for better and earlier diagnoses and treatment, reducing the length of hospital stays and medical costs in the process.

	“The less time you spend in the hospital, the better,” says Quirk.

THE MARKET The company is targeting the country’s 7,000 hospitals and 48,000 ambulances with a variety of applications in mind. Bladder ultrasound is “a big market – $150 million a year,” says Quirk. But dBMEDx is ultimately eying a broader medical market, he adds. “This scanner can be reconfigured to do a number of different measurements. Sepsis is a biggie.” Sepsis, or an overwhelming infection, is more easily and less expensively treated earlier.

	The veterinary market is also promising for dBMEDx, as ultrasound often requires general anesthesia for the animal, Quirk adds, noting that vets familiar with dBMEDx are enthusiastic about the technology’s potential.

FINANCING After an initial seed round of $350,000 in September 2012, dBMEDx raised a second round of $1.1 million in April 2013. The first round “was to go from concept to prototype,” says Quirk. “This takes us from prototype to commercialization.”

where Littleton   |    FOUNDED 2010    |   web  www.dbmedx.com

	“The beauty of having a practicing doctor on the team: Every day he runs into a problem we can solve.”   
	­— dBMEDx CEO David Shine on Chief Medical Officer Dr. Bill Quirk
