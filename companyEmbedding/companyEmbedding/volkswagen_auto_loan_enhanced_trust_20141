      Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1
    





April 30, 2014 04:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by 
      Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1 (VALET 2014-1) as follows:
    

      --$288,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$126,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO score of 763 
      is consistent with recently issued VALET transactions and, combined with 
      the strong internal credit-tier distribution, indicates a strong 
      borrower. The concentration of extended term loans has decreased from 
      the previous transactions.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: VALET 2014-1 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial credit enhancement (CE) is 3.10% of 
      the initial adjusted pool balance, growing to 3.50% consistent with 
      recent Volkswagen transactions. Annual excess spread is expected to be 
      2.07%. Consistent with expected ratings of 'AAAsf', CE is sufficient to 
      cover in excess of a 5.0x multiple of Fitch's base case expected 
      lifetime cumulative net losses (CNLs) of 1.20%.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquencies on 
      Volkswagen Credit Inc.'s (VCI) portfolio and securitizations have shown 
      continued improvement from the peak levels observed in the 2007 and 2008 
      vintages and have stabilized at low levels since 2010.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates the parent Volkswagen Group 'A-' 
      with a Positive Rating Outlook. Volkswagen has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results in recent years, and its overall corporate 
      health has remained strong.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes VCI to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter and servicer. These capabilities are 
      further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss 
      experience and securitization performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of VALET 2014-1 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they could lead 
      to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of 
      up to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in 
      Fitch's presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 
      2014-1--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

ARTICLE II 
PURCHASE  SECTION 2.1
Agreement to Sell and Contribute on the Closing Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, VCI agrees to transfer, assign, set over, sell and otherwise convey to the Purchaser without recourse (subject to
the obligations herein) on the Closing Date all of VCIs right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables, the Collections after the Cut-Off Date, the Receivable Files and the Related Security relating thereto, described in an
Assignment in the form of Exhibit A delivered on the Closing Date (collectively, the Purchased Assets), having a Net Pool Balance as of the Cut-Off Date equal to $1,334,566,845.00, which sale shall be effective as of the
Cut-Off Date. The sale, transfer, assignment, contribution and conveyance made hereunder does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by the Purchaser of any obligation of the Originator to the Obligors, the Dealers or any
other Person in connection with the Receivables or the other assets and properties conveyed hereunder or any agreement, document or instrument related thereto. 
SECTION 2.2 Consideration and Payment. In consideration of the transfer of the Purchased Assets conveyed to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.1 on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay to VCI on such date an amount equal to the estimated fair market value of the Purchased Assets, which amount shall be paid (a) in cash to VCI and (b) by a capital
contribution by VCI of an undivided interest in such Purchased Assets that increases its equity interest in the Purchaser in an amount equal to the excess of the estimated fair market value of the Purchased Assets over the amount of cash paid by the
Purchaser to VCI.  ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 
SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of VCI. VCI makes the following representations and warranties as of the Closing Date on
which the Purchaser will be deemed to have relied in acquiring the Purchased Assets. The representations and warranties will survive the conveyance of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the conveyance of the Purchased
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Grant thereof by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture: 
(a) Existence and Power. VCI is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of organization and has,
in all material respects, all power and authority required to carry on its business as now conducted. VCI has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the
ability of VCI to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Purchased Assets. 
(b) Authorization and No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by VCI of each Transaction Document to which it is a
party (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of VCI and (ii) do not contravene or constitute a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational documents or
(C) any 
 









 
-2-
 
Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)



material agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a party or its property is subject (other than violations of which do not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of
any of such agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by, or VCIs ability to perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents). 
(c) No Consent Required. No approval or authorization by, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by VCI of any Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained and filings that have previously been made and (iii) approvals,
authorizations or filings which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Purchased Assets or would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of VCI to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.  (d) Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which
VCI is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of VCI enforceable against VCI in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of corporations from time to time in effect or by general principles of equity. 
(e) No Proceedings. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of VCI, threatened against VCI before or by
any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and adversely affect the performance by VCI of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, or (iv) relate to VCI that would materially and adversely affect the federal or Applicable Tax State income, excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the Notes. 
(f) Lien Filings. VCI is not aware of any material judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against VCI. 
(g) State of Incorporation; Name; No Changes. VCIs state of incorporation is the State of Delaware. VCIs exact legal name is
VW Credit, Inc. VCI has not changed its name whether by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, by reorganization or otherwise, and has not changed its state of incorporation, within the four months preceding the Closing Date. 
SECTION 3.2 Representations and Warranties of VCI as to each Receivable. VCI hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth
on Schedule I as to the Receivables, sold, contributed, transferred, assigned, set over and otherwise conveyed to the Purchaser under this Agreement on which such representations and warranties the Purchaser relies in acquiring the
Receivables. Such representations and warranties shall survive the sale of the Receivables to the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and the Grant of the Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.
Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, VCI shall not be required to notify any insurer with respect to any Insurance Policy obtained by an Obligor or to notify any Dealer about any aspect
of the transaction contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


SECTION 3.3 Repurchase upon Breach. Upon discovery by or notice to the Purchaser or VCI of
a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 with respect to any Receivable at the time such representations and warranties were made which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or
the Noteholders in such Receivable, the party discovering such breach or receiving such notice shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided, that delivery of the Servicers Certificate shall be deemed to
constitute prompt notice by VCI and the Purchaser of such breach; provided, further, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect any obligation of VCI hereunder. If the breach materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Issuer or the Noteholder in such Receivable, then VCI shall either (a) correct or cure such breach or (b) repurchase such Receivable from the Purchaser, in either case on or before the Payment Date following the end of the
Collection Period which includes the 60th day (or, if VCI elects, an earlier date) after the date that VCI became aware or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to have a material and adverse effect if such
breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Purchaser (or its assignee) to receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any such purchase by VCI shall be at a price equal to the Repurchase Price. In consideration for such
repurchase, VCI shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to the Purchaser equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing such amount into the Collection Account prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on such date of repurchase. Upon payment of
such Repurchase Price by VCI, the Purchaser shall release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as may be reasonably requested by VCI to evidence such
release, transfer or assignment or more effectively vest in VCI or its designee any Receivable and any related Purchased Assets repurchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and agreed that the obligation of VCI to repurchase any Receivable as
described above shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such breach available to the Purchaser.  SECTION 3.4 Protection of
Title.  (a) VCI shall authorize and file such financing statements and cause to be authorized and filed such continuation and other
statements, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of the Purchaser under this Agreement in the Receivables (other than any Related Security with respect thereto, to the
extent that the interest of the Purchaser therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement). VCI shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Purchaser file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as
provided above, as soon as available following such filing.  (b) VCI shall not change its name, identity, corporate structure or
jurisdiction of organization in any manner that would make any financing statement or continuation statement filed by VCI in accordance with paragraph (a) above seriously misleading within the meaning of Sections 9-506, 9-507 or 9-508 of the UCC, unless it shall have given the Purchaser at least five days prior written notice thereof and, to the extent necessary, shall have promptly filed amendments to previously filed
financing statements or continuation statements described in paragraph (a) above (or shall have made arrangements to take such action substantially simultaneously with such change, if it is not practicable to take such action in
advance). 
 









 
-4-
 
Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


(c) VCI shall give the Purchaser at least ten days prior written notice of any change of
location of VCI for purposes of Section 9-307 of the UCC and shall have taken all action prior to making such change (or shall have made arrangements to take such action substantially simultaneously with
such change, if it is not possible to take such action in advance) reasonably necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Purchaser to amend all previously filed financing statements or continuation statements described in paragraph
(a) above.  (d) VCI shall maintain (or shall cause its Sub-Servicer to maintain) accounts and records as to each Receivable
accurately and in sufficient detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to know at any time the status of such Receivable, including payments and recoveries made and payments owing (and the nature of each) and (ii) reconciliation between
payments or recoveries on (or with respect to) each Receivable and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Collection Account in respect of such Receivable. 
(e) VCI shall maintain (or shall cause its Sub-Servicer to maintain) its computer systems so that, from time to time after the conveyance under
this Agreement of the Receivables, the master computer records (including any backup archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the interest of the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser) in such Receivable and that
such Receivable is owned by such Person. Indication of such Persons interest in a Receivable shall not be deleted from or modified on such computer systems until, and only until, the related Receivable shall have been paid in full or
repurchased.  (f) If at any time VCI shall propose to sell, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any interest in motor
vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, VCI shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes, records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) that, if they
shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser). 
SECTION 3.5 Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances and grants of security interests pursuant to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, VCI shall not sell, pledge, assign or transfer the Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
on any interest therein, and VCI shall defend the right, title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser against all claims of third parties claiming through or under VCI. 
SECTION 3.6 Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. VCI hereby makes the perfection representations, warranties and
covenants set forth on Schedule II hereto to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have relied on such representations, warranties and covenants in acquiring the Purchased Assets.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


ARTICLE IV 
MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION 4.1
Transfers Intended as Sale; Security Interest.  (a) Each of the parties hereto expressly intends and agrees that the transfers
contemplated and effected under this Agreement are complete and absolute sales, transfers, assignments and contributions rather than pledges or assignments of only a security interest and shall be given effect as such for all purposes. It is further
the intention of the parties hereto that the Receivables and related Purchased Assets shall not be part of VCIs estate in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of VCI. The sales and transfers by VCI of the Receivables and related Purchased
Assets hereunder are and shall be without recourse to, or representation or warranty (express or implied) by, VCI, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. The limited rights of recourse specified herein against VCI are intended to provide
a remedy for breach of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the property sold, rather than to the collectibility of the Receivables. 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Receivables and other Purchased Assets are held to be property of VCI, or if for any
reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create indebtedness or a security interest in the Receivables and other Purchased Assets, then it is intended that: 
(i) This Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the New York UCC and
the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction;  (ii) The conveyance provided for in Section 2.1 shall be deemed
to be a grant by VCI of, and VCI hereby grants to the Purchaser, a security interest in all of its right (including the power to convey title thereto), title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the Receivables and other
Purchased Assets, to secure such indebtedness and the performance of the obligations of VCI hereunder;  (iii) The
possession by the Purchaser or its agent of the Receivable Files and any other property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession by the
purchaser or a person designated by such purchaser, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction; and 
(iv) Notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons holding such
property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Purchaser for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


SECTION 4.2 Notices, Etc. All demands, notices and communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be delivered or mailed by registered or certified first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, hand delivery, prepaid courier service, or by facsimile and addressed in each case as
specified on Schedule II to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or at such other address as shall be designated by any of the specified addressees in a written notice to the other parties hereto. Any notice required or permitted to be mailed to
a Noteholder shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address of such Noteholder as shown in the Note Register. Delivery shall occur only upon receipt or reported tender of such communication by an officer of the recipient
entitled to receive such notices located at the address of such recipient for notices hereunder; provided, however, that any notice to a Noteholder mailed within the time prescribed in this Agreement shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Noteholder shall receive such notice.  SECTION 4.3 Choice of Law. THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL, SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE RULES THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW, OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK
GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS. 
SECTION 4.4 Headings. The section headings hereof have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be construed to affect the
meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement.  SECTION 4.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 
SECTION 4.6 Amendment. 
(a) Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended by VCI and the Purchaser without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, any
Noteholder, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or any other Person subject to the satisfaction of one of the following conditions: 
(i) VCI or the Purchaser delivers an Opinion of Counsel to the Indenture Trustee to the effect that such amendment will not
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders;  (ii) VCI or the Purchaser delivers an Officers
Certificate of VCI or the Purchaser, respectively, to the Indenture Trustee to the effect that such amendment will not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders; or 
(iii) the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied with respect to such amendment and VCI or the Purchaser notifies the Indenture
Trustee in writing that the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied with respect to such amendment;  provided, that no amendment pursuant to
this Section 4.6 shall be effective which affects the rights, protections or duties of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee without the prior written consent of such Person. 
 









 
-7-
 
Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


(b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by VCI and the Purchaser, with the
consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate principal balance of the Outstanding Notes, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders. It will not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it will be sufficient if such consent approves
the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders will be subject to such reasonable
requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement. 
(c) Prior to the execution of any such amendment, VCI shall provide written notification of the substance of such amendment to each Rating
Agency; and promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent, VCI (i) shall furnish a copy of such amendment or consent to each Rating Agency and the Indenture Trustee and (ii) if this Agreement is amended in accordance with
clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 4.6(a), shall furnish a copy of such Opinion of Counsel or Officers Certificate, as the case may be, to each of the Rating Agencies. 
(d) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive and
conclusively rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of such amendment have been satisfied. The Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which adversely affects the Owner Trustees or the Indenture Trustees, as applicable, own rights, duties or immunities under this
Agreement.  SECTION 4.7 Waivers. No failure or delay on the part of the Purchaser, the Servicer, VCI, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee in exercising any power or right hereunder (to the extent such Person has any power or right hereunder) shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or demand on the Purchaser or VCI in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by either party under this
Agreement shall, except as may otherwise be stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval under this Agreement shall require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted
hereunder.  SECTION 4.8 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents contain a final and complete integration of all prior
expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, superseding all prior oral or written understandings. There
are no unwritten agreements among the parties.  SECTION 4.9 Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the covenants,
agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this
Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


SECTION 4.10 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain in full force and effect until
such time as the parties hereto shall agree.  SECTION 4.11 Acknowledgment and Agreement. By execution below, VCI expressly
acknowledges and consents to the sale of the Purchased Assets and the assignment of all rights of the Purchaser related thereto and under this Agreement by the Purchaser to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Grant of a
security interest in the Receivables and the other Purchased Assets by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture for the benefit of the Noteholders. In addition, VCI hereby acknowledges and agrees that for so long as the Notes
are outstanding, the Indenture Trustee will have the right to exercise all powers, privileges and claims of the Purchaser under this Agreement in the event that the Purchaser shall fail to exercise the same. 
SECTION 4.12 Cumulative Remedies. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

statute now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction. This Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  SECTION 4.14
Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
