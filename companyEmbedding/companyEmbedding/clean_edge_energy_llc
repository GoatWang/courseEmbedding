	Shaving Tips for Men| How to Shave
































 Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube 























 













STEP 1:  WASH IT
How:
Start by washing your face with soap and warm water. Feels good, right?
Why:
Water allows your whiskers to soften. The soap removes oils from your hair and skin, but it’s NOT a shaving gel substitute, pal.







STEP 2:  APPLY IT
How:
Apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes. What you do with your free time is up to you, big guy.
Why:
Gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin, reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade. It can also make you look kinda badass.







STEP 3:  SHAVE IT
How:
Most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows. But, if you’re not a super-sensitive lad, you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain. Ladies dig the smooth.
Why:
With sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice. Either way, go slow and avoid rapid strokes. The only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces.







STEP 4:  RINSE IT
How:
Immediately after shaving, splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather. Look at you now, champ!
Why:
The cold water closes your facial pores, plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face. Be sure to check those earlobes, too.







STEP 5:  REST IT
How:
Rest your skin for 30 minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications, or before going swimming…really.
Why:
Skin is most sensitive after shaving, so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation. Plus, chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip.







FINAL STEP:  THUMBS UP!
How:
NICE JOB, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GET YOUR EDGE?

indebtedness or other securities or interests convertible or
exchangeable into Units or other interests in the Company and
(iii) warrants, options or other rights to purchase or
otherwise acquire Units or other interests in the Company. Upon the
acquisition of any Units or other interests in the Company by a
Person who is not a Member, such Person shall execute and deliver a
counterpart of this Agreement and shall become a Member hereunder,
and Schedule A hereto shall be amended to reflect such
issuance and new Member.

 

3.5                                 
Distributions. 
Subject to the provision of the Act,

First Trust NASDAQ® Clean Edge® Green Energy Index Fund (QCLN)




Fund Summary|Holdings|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - The First Trust NASDAQ® Clean Edge® Green Energy Index Fund is an exchange-traded index fund. The objective of the Fund is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the Fund's fees and expenses) of an equity index called the NASDAQ® Clean Edge® Green Energy IndexSM.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.
    





                    The index is a modified market capitalization weighted index designed to track the performance of clean energy companies that are publicly traded in the United 
                    States and includes companies engaged in manufacturing, development, distribution and installation of emerging clean-energy technologies including, but not 
                    limited to, solar photovoltaics, biofuels and advanced batteries.
                

                    The NASDAQ® Clean Edge® Green Energy IndexSM is a modified market cap weighted index in which larger companies receive a larger 
                    index weighting. The index weighting methodology includes caps to prevent high concentrations among larger alternative energy stocks.
                

                    The index is reconstituted twice a year in March and September and rebalanced quarterly.

			    of excess reward per unit of volatility. Correlation is a measure of the similarity of performance.
			









				*Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
				results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns
				and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than
				their original cost. 
				

 
				After Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold.
				After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns
				do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are 
                based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread on the stock exchange on which shares of the fund are listed for 
                trading as of the time that the fund’s NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except
				those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. The fund's performance reflects fee waivers
				and expense reimbursements, absent which performance would have been lower. 
			

				After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and
				do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax
				situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
				their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


5
The unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield is calculated the same as the 30-day SEC yield, however it excludes contractual fee waivers and expense reimbursements.


6
12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.

The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.





        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.	
	
The fund's return may not match the return of the NASDAQ Clean Edge® Green Energy Index.  Securities held by the fund will generally not be bought or sold in response to market fluctuations.

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular stock owned by the fund, fund shares or stocks in general may fall in value. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective will be achieved.


    The fund may invest in securities issued by companies concentrated in a particular industry. The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.


    Renewable and alternative energy companies can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product cycles, legislation resulting in more strict government regulations and enforcement policies, fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of alternative energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, the supply of and demand for oil and gas, world events and economic conditions. Shares of clean energy companies have been significantly more volatile than shares of companies operating in other more established industries. This industry is relatively nascent and under-researched in comparison to more established and mature sectors.


    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.

	Shaving Tips for Men| How to Shave
































 Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube 























 













STEP 1:  WASH IT
How:
Start by washing your face with soap and warm water. Feels good, right?
Why:
Water allows your whiskers to soften. The soap removes oils from your hair and skin, but it’s NOT a shaving gel substitute, pal.







STEP 2:  APPLY IT
How:
Apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes. What you do with your free time is up to you, big guy.
Why:
Gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin, reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade. It can also make you look kinda badass.







STEP 3:  SHAVE IT
How:
Most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows. But, if you’re not a super-sensitive lad, you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain. Ladies dig the smooth.
Why:
With sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice. Either way, go slow and avoid rapid strokes. The only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces.







STEP 4:  RINSE IT
How:
Immediately after shaving, splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather. Look at you now, champ!
Why:
The cold water closes your facial pores, plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face. Be sure to check those earlobes, too.







STEP 5:  REST IT
How:
Rest your skin for 30 minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications, or before going swimming…really.
Why:
Skin is most sensitive after shaving, so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation. Plus, chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip.







FINAL STEP:  THUMBS UP!
How:
NICE JOB, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GET YOUR EDGE?
