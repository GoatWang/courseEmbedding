MineralTree Solutions for Banks
AP Automation
Integrated Payables
Commercial Card Solutions





Integrated Payables Solutions For Your Business Clients
Consumer-oriented bill pay tools don’t offer the security and transaction detail businesses need, and enterprise-level solutions are too complex and expensive for growing, middle market businesses.

This gap creates an opportunity for your financial institution to increase fee income by offering MineralTree Invoice-to-Pay to your business clients. Your bank also gains additional interchange revenue as more vendor payments move onto commercial cards.
For most companies, AP is manual, ad hoc, paper-based, and a pain when it comes to making vendor payments. Integrated payables solutions are just not fitting the bill. 
Banks that partner with MineralTree offer their business clients powerful, differentiating online invoice payment solutions. With Accounts Payable Automation and Integrated Payables, businesses receive the simple, easy-to-use, secure, automated invoice-to-payment capabilities they need.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any mutual fund carefully before investing. Download a money market fund prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about a fund. Read it carefully before investing.You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.Although the fund's board has no current intention to impose a fee upon the sale of shares or temporarily suspend redemptions if the fund’s liquidity falls below certain levels, the board reserves the ability to do so after providing appropriate notice to shareholders.Yield and investment return fluctuate and past performance is no guarantee of future results. As a measure of current income, 7-day yield most closely reflects the fund's current income generating ability. 30-day yield is based upon dividends per share from net investment income during the past 30 days, divided by the period ended maximum offering price per share and annualized. Daily and 30-day yield quotations may reflect current expense absorptions, without which performance would have been lower.While dividends are declared daily, they are paid monthly (if any).Market Value NAV: Calculated based on available market quotations (except overnight securities which are valued at amortized cost) related to the Fund’s securities at the close of business on the date stated. It is calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent or (or $0.0001).WAM: A measure of the average maturity of all of the underlying money market instruments in the fund, weighted to reflect the relative percentage ownership of each instrument, and taking into account applicable “maturity shortening” provisions provided by the Rule. Generally, for money market funds, WAM can be used primarily as a measure of relative sensitivity to interest rate changes.WAL: WAL is the WAM of the money market fund calculated without reference to the “maturity shortening” provisions of Rule 2a-7 permitted for purposes of calculating WAM. Because WAL does not reflect the rule’s “maturity shortening” provisions, WAL will generally be higher than WAM.Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and Weighted Average Life to Maturity (WAL) statistics displayed before approximately 7:30 p.m. ET reflect calculations made prior to the afternoon time of day for pricing fund shares; WAM and WAL statistics displayed after 7:30 p.m. ET reflect updated calculations.Any order in proper form placed with Dreyfus by the Fund’s trading deadline and for which Federal Funds are received by 6:00 PM ET will be effective on that date. Investors will earn the dividend declared on that day.The information on this Web site is not an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security, nor shall any such security be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase, or sale may not lawfully be made.

Moodys





		Fund ratings are statements of opinion, not statements of fact or recommendations to buy, sell or hold the shares of a fund.
		 Standard & Poor's (S&P) believes that, with a Principal Stability Rating of AAAm, the fund has an extremely strong capacity to maintain principal and stability and to limit exposure to principal losses due to credit, market, and/or liquidity risks.
		 For more information on rating methodology visit www.standardandpoors.com.
		 Moody's Investors Service rates money market mutual funds 'Aaa-mf' if, in Moody's opinion, a fund has a very strong ability to meet the dual objectives of providing liquidity and preserving capital. This rating, which is derived from a combination of Moody's assessment of a fund's Portfolio Credit Profile, Portfolio Stability Profile, and other qualitative factors, is not intended to consider prospective performance of a fund. For more information on rating methodology visit www.moodys.com.
		 Rating agencies may revise or withdraw their ratings at any time, and ratings are not intended to guarantee a fund's performance nor are they intended to signal the suitability of an investment.
