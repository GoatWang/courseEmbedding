(NASDAQ:    MIIIU) (the "Company") announced today the closing of its initial public offering of 15 million units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $150 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any, in the public offering. Each unit consists of one share of the Company's common stock and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of its common stock.

The Company's units began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "MIIIU" on July 7, 2016. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols "MIII" and "MIIIW", respectively.
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as the sole book-running manager for the offering.  Chardan acted as co-manager.
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 6, 2016.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any State or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such State or jurisdiction.

We are offering 15,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the private placement units will be used as set forth
in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of a loan from M III LLC of up to $250,000 that we may draw down as
    described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of   
    this offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been        
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting      
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in 
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital  
    expenses.                                                                   

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.0%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised, 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment will
    be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $6,000,000, which     
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $7,350,000 if  
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid  
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the       
    remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a      
    portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our  
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,      
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in      
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.              

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account to pay our taxes. Based on the current interest rate environment, we
    would expect approximately $30,000 per year to be available to us from      
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 24 months       
    following the closing of this offering; however, we can provide no          
    assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 
    0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust  
    account may be invested.                                                    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $6,000,000 (or up
to $7,350,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $30,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working
capital expenses, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we
are unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

M III LLC has loaned or agreed to loan us up to $250,000 to be used for a
portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing,
unsecured and is due at the earlier of July 31, 2016 or the closing of this
offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the
$600,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering
expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans will be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and
Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private placement shares and (except for Cantor Fitzgerald)
public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these 
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a Delaware blank check corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a
merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses,
which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial


 business
combination. We have not identified any business combination target and we have
not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions,
directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.

We intend to focus our efforts on seeking and consummating an initial business
combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $350 million
and $750 million, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise
value may be considered. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any
business industry or sector and in any geographic region, we expect to focus on
businesses based in North America that engage primarily in the financial
services, healthcare services and industrials sectors because we believe that
this best combines the expertise and experience of our combined team with
sectors that offer attractive investment opportunities.

It is our philosophy that capital has become increasingly commoditized and that
successful investment results will come not from having capital alone, but
rather from having the ability to accurately assess businesses with complex
strategic, management and operational issues and the added expertise to deal
with these issues in increasingly competitive and changing environments. We
believe this to be particularly true during times of economic uncertainty,
dislocations in capital markets and other conditions that create a challenge for
businesses, and opportunities for investors with the right management team. In
recognition of this, we have assembled a team of executives, directors and other
advisors who blend traditional investment and acquisition expertise, management
and operational expertise, and deep experience in financial, strategic and
operational restructurings. We are confident that this team is capable of
creating value in businesses that we acquire.

We believe that the broad experience and expertise of our combined team will
enable us to explore a wide range of potential acquisition targets. We intend to
target companies with strong business fundamentals and those which are in need
of operational improvement and can thereby benefit from our human and financial
capital. The members of our combined team have proven experience and track
records in identifying, acquiring and improving businesses that have strong
underlying fundamentals, but are undervalued due to company-specific issues,
industry dislocation, limited access to capital, or other exogenous factors that
are fundamentally temporary in nature. Our combined team has played meaningful
roles in contrarian investment situations with businesses requiring significant

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Is a C Corporation Right For Your Business?
What you need to know about forming a C Corporation













What Is a C Corporation?
A C Corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax, regulatory and official reasons. A C Corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business, and contrasts with other popular business structures including Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), S Corporations, Sole Proprietorships and others.
Generally, a C Corporation structure is better for larger businesses. This is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares, through having an Initial Public Offering, or IPO. A C Corporation is much more attractive to potential investors, including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation.
The majority of larger businesses in the United States are structured as C Corporations, although a C Corp could, theoretically, consist of just one person. The information below will help you decide if a C Corporation structure is right for your business.
How Is a C Corporation Formed?
A C Corp, also known as a corporation, is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing “Articles of Incorporation” with the Secretary of State in the state of incorporation. The policies, articles, cost and regulations for forming a C Corp vary from state-to-state. Details on exactly how to form a C Corporation can be found at the end of this article.
The corporation is the oldest form of business entity. It has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose, with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own. Although a C Corp is a popular business structure, there are other options for forming businesses in the US.
The Advantages of C Corporations
Forming a C Corporation does have several benefits:
1. A C Corporation has Limited Liability
Because a C Corp is a separate legal entity, the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors, investors and shareholders. Generally, the owners of a C Corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations. This does not apply in all cases, for example if corporate funds are misused, there is wilful fraud, or if certain rules and regulations are not followed.
2. A C Corporation Exists Independently of its Owners
A C Corporation can have “Perpetual Existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business.
3. Ownership of C Corporations Can Be Fluid and Transferred
Ownership in a C Corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues. These stocks can be bought and sold between investors, and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange, institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company.
4. Ease of Access to Funding Through Issuing Stock
If a C Corporation want to raise money, it can hold an “Initial Public Offering (IPO)” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange. This can bring significant money into a business. They can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding, although this can dilute the value of existing shares.
5. Enhanced Business or Corporate Credibility
Most of the businesses that are household names are C Corporations. Incorporating as a C Corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority.
The Disadvantages of a C Corporation
A C Corporation does have some disadvantages. Briefly, they are:

A different tax structure to other types of businesses.
Double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them.
Legal rules, regulations, formalities, and compliance they have to meet.

We cover these in more detail below.
What Are the Differences Between an S Corp, C Corp and LLC?
Two other popular business entity structures in the US are the S Corp and the LLC. They provide many of the same protections offered by a C Corp but have less formal rules on taxation, governance and compliance. This can mean more flexibility in how an LLC or S Corp is owned and funded.
One of the main differences between C Corps and S Corps / LLCs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed.

For LLCs and S Corps, any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’ / shareholders’ / members’ tax returns, where it is taxed as part of1 their overall income. The company does not have to file a separate tax return.
S Corps and C Corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.
S Corps are limited to having a maximum of 100 shareholders.
A C Corp is taxed at the corporate level — That means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned.

How Are Profits And Taxes Handled With A C Corp?
A C Corporation is taxed as a separate business entity. Unlike individuals, C Corporations have to file a designated tax form with the IRS, which is called IRS Form 1120. Additionally, C Corporations have their own tax rates.
Corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital, this can shelter some of the profits from taxation.
C Corporation Tax Rates
The tax rates levied on C Corporations are as follows.
Profit

Up to $50,000 — 15%
$50,000 - $75,000 — 25%
$75,000 - $100,000 — 34%
$100,000 - $335,000 — 39%
$335,000 - $10,000,000 — 34%
$10,000,000 - $15,000,000 — 35%
$15,000,000 - $18,333,333 — 38%
More than $18,333,333 — 35%

Stock Dividends from C Corporations
A C Corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends, which are distributed to shareholders. The percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own.
Dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice (double-taxed). They are taxed first at the corporate level as profit (on the corporation’s form 1120), and again at the individual level as stock dividends (on the shareholder's form 1040).
What are a C Corporation's Legal Requirements?
A C Corporation must meet certain requirements:
1. Hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the shareholders and the board of directors
The annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information, strategic decisions, opportunities, risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with.
2. Issue shares to investors as ownership of the business
Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares. The management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.
3. Appoint a board of directors
The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation. These are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed.
4. Assign Certain Positions in the Corporation
A C Corporation will need to have all of the following positions. In a small C Corp, one person could hold multiple of these positions.

Shareholders: They own the company's stock and are responsible for electing directors, amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation like mergers and the sale of corporate assets. They alone are allowed to dissolve the corporation.
Directors: They manage the corporation and are responsible for issuing stock, electing officers and making the corporation's major decisions.
Officers: The corporation must have a president, secretary, and treasurer. These officers are responsible for making the day-to-day decisions that govern the corporation's operation.
Employees: They receive a salary in return for their work for the corporation.

Forming a C Corporation
If a C Corporation is right for you, here’s how to form one:

Choose a legal name for your new business.
If the Secretary of State in your state reserves business names, reserve the name.
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation — These should be sent to your Secretary of State.
Establish who your initial investors and shareholders are.
Create and issue stock certificates to your shareholders.
Apply for a business license — You may require licenses from your state, county, and township.
Apply for any other certificates you need to conduct business — These can vary from industry to industry.
Get an “Employer Identification Number (EIN): from the IRS — You can file online, or complete form SS-4.
Apply for any other ID numbers and complete other formalities required by your state and local government agencies.
Requirements do vary from one jurisdiction to another, but you will generally need to get ID numbers for the unemployment, disability and other payroll taxes.
Appoint a board of directors.
Assign other positions in the business as required by law.

We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.

please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
