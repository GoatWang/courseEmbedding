About Savant Capital LLC



The groundwork for Savant began many years ago. Thomas A. Muldowney started the predecessor to Savant in 1986 in Rockford, IL. It was called Savant Planning Group, Ltd. Tom responded to his frustration with how financial services were traditionally offered—suspicious advice given away for “free” in exchange for the sale of a commissioned product. However, individuals really needed true, independent financial and estate planning advice that was unbiased by inherent conflicts of interest. After several years and much effort, Tom had built a thriving, fee-only planning practice. Still, his clients had no systematic way to implement the investment strategies necessary to execute his clients' financial plans. So Tom became partners with Brent R. Brodeski in 1992. Tom and Brent then embarked on a journey to determine how to best provide Tom’s financial planning clients with the fee-only investment management capabilities that they badly needed and requested.
After many months of research, Tom and Brent concluded that a no-load, index-based investment approach that benefited from low portfolio turnover, low cost, low taxes, and broad global diversification would provide clients the best opportunity for success. Since traditional product oriented providers were unwilling to offer such an approach, Savant set out to create a service that would first and foremost: meet the needs of the client in the most efficient and effective manner possible. With this, Savant Capital Management, Inc. was born. We believe Savant is in a unique position to provide unbiased, unencumbered, and superior professional asset management while family members are able to maintain complete control of family matters, estate matters, as well as overall investment policy.
Today, Savant is an independent, fee-only integrative wealth management firm helping clients maximize their assets, enhance the quality of their lives, and realize personal and financial goals. In addition to a team of experts, great results, top service, and a world-class experience, Savant clients benefit from simplicity, ease, clarity, confidence, focus, vision and peace-of mind.
Definition of "savant" – a person of profound or extensive learning; learned scholar

Intern Program




















Opportunity to Gain Valuable Experience







Our internship program provides high school and college students with the opportunity to gain experience in the financial industry. Each intern's assignment is based on his/her interests and our company needs. These assignments are important to Savant’s business, and offer interns the opportunity to contribute substantially.

Our interns find that there are many advantages to accepting a summer internship at Savant. Interns are assigned projects that help meet important business needs, but also offer challenging and unique opportunities for interns to learn, grow, and succeed. Our interns have been involved in trading, investment analysis, marketing, database maintenance, investment research, financial planning research, market research, cash flow analysis, excel modeling, launching new offices, and much more.

Our interns have the opportunity to extend their internship into winter and spring. Some interns even come back and end up at Savant full-time. However, all would agree that their internships at Savant provide a unique opportunity to learn and grow as they build their ideal careers.

In One Intern's Words:
“I believe Savant has provided me with a great understanding of today’s market, along with the skills needed to make decisions and interact with others.  Prior to working at Savant, I viewed internships as making copies, making coffee, and avoiding mistakes, but at Savant, I have learned, grown, and developed a clear understanding of what a real internship should be.”

Independent, Fee-only Investment Advisor







"We want to help navigate your ideal future."
Perhaps you want to retire early, travel the globe, buy a second home, fund higher education for your family’s next generation, contribute to your community, or leave a legacy for multiple generations.

Getting to your ideal destination requires planning, focus, coordination, and the ability and willingness to adapt as you encounter challenges along the way. Your first step is to determine what type of future you desire – where do you really want to go? From there Savant can serve as your financial guide by helping you identify a starting point, the direction you are heading, and the best route along the way.

For 30 years, we have provided integrated investment management, financial planning, tax preparation and advisory, and family office services to financially established individuals, trust funds, retirement plans, and non-profit organizations.

We do not sell products, and thus are able to deliver objective fiduciary advice and fully transparent service to you, our clients. Additionally, Savant does not receive benefits from brokerage services, commissions or finder’s fees. This independence allows us to remain impartial and do what is in your best interest, giving you the peace of mind that comes from engaging in only the most trusting relationship.

Savant approaches every client relationship as a fiduciary –  someone who is managing the assets of another person and stands in a special relationship of trust, confidence, and/or legal responsibility. A fiduciary is required by law to always act in the client's best interest.

Fiduciary Matters

June 06, 2017

Brent R. Brodeski, MBA, CPA, CFP®, CFA®, AIFA® / 
         	Uncategorized



Fiduciary: a legal term that has always been near and dear to us at Savant, a word that has long been toxic to brokerages and traditional investment firms, and a concept generally not understood by consumers at large.
In layman’s terms, a fiduciary is someone who is legally and morally bound to stand in your shoes, look through your eyes, and advise you and your family on important financial decisions in the same way he would make them for himself or

The First Five Steps When Retirement Approaches

May 17, 2017

Joel R. Cundick / 
         	Estate Planning, Financial Planning



One of the top concerns for Americans in their 60s is how to pay for retirement. Consider focusing on a plan for these five areas of financial planning to help gain confidence as you approach or enter retirement. Interestingly, many individuals’ first anxiety is loss of principal – particularly with 2008 still in our collective rearview mirrors. However, given that retirement may last 30 years or longer, workers approaching retirement need to be just as focused on loss of purchasing

Who Will Care for Your Children? Estate Planning for Young Adults and Families

May 12, 2017

Mary Beth Brummond / 
         	Estate Planning, Financial Planning, Gifting



Young adulthood often marks the passage of several major life events including beginning a career, getting married, starting a family, and buying a first home. As young adults ourselves, my husband and I welcomed our first child, moved states for a new career, and bought our first home, all in the past year.
While settling into being first-time parents and exploring our new neighborhood, another important item lingered on our to-do list: ensuring our son would be taken care of, if

Kelli Peterson / 
         	Medicine, Retirement, Retirement Planning



According to a recent study by Fidelity, the average total cost of health care for a retired couple, currently age 65 and living until ages 85/87, will be $245,000!1 When people think about their retirement goals, they often overlook the expenses associated with keeping up their health. Being aware of your options and how you can fund this goal in retirement can help mitigate the possibility of having to give up your current lifestyle.

Surviving on Social Security Survivor Benefits

March 29, 2017

Ryan G. Monette, CFP®, ChFC® / 
         	Retirement, Retirement Planning



There is usually some permanent damage done when you lose someone you love. Most of the time, this comes in the form of grieving for that special person. From the benefit of time, the intense grieving usually fades away. Survivors are left with the burden of surviving, and, financially speaking, sometimes there is little available to help.
When Social Security was passed in 1935 it was strictly a benefit for retirees. It wasn’t until 1939 that a change was added to

Retirement Plans



















Helping Build Your Employees' Ideal Futures







Are your retirement plan providers meeting your company, management, and employees' needs? Structuring and maintaining a plan that best meets the needs of your organization while insuring compliance with all governing laws and regulations is a full-time job – one that’s fraught with numerous fiduciary hurdles and pitfalls.

While fiduciary duty should be a principal focus, as the plan sponsor you probably don’t have the time or in-depth knowledge necessary to meet the requirements that regulatory bodies demand.  This is the impetus that led our team to create the The Ideal Retirement PlanSM.

The Ideal Retirement PlanSM is committed to helping companies provide an attractive benefit plan to their employees while reducing their fiduciary risk and minimizing administrative burden. Furthermore, we do this while providing a best-in-class value proposition to your participants.





The Ideal Retirement Plan

Provides a single point of contract to simplify the coordination of all necessary services.
Considers cost control through leveraged provider partnerships and full disclosure of fees at all levels.
Executes proactive, in-depth employee education through a variety of settings.
Offers flexible investment portfolio design options to appeal to the individual participants.

 

Our Suite of Benefit Plan Solutions Includes:

Ideal 401(k)
Ideal Defined Benefit (Traditional and Cash Balance)
Ideal 457
Ideal Profit Sharing
Ideal 403(b)




Our Retirement Plans Include:


Sponsors
Participants
Advisors
Education & Resources
Customer Service




CEFEX Certification
We are proud to serve as a fiduciary to our clients, and it’s been our strategic advantage for nearly 30 years. In fact, the Centre for Fiduciary Excellence (CEFEX) has recognized Savant as a Certified Investment Steward and a Certified Investment Advisor. These designations confirm that Savant’s fiduciary practices as an employer and as a provider have been audited by an independent global assessment and certification organization to be in conformity with global fiduciary best practices. We extend these same policies, procedures, and oversight to our Ideal Retirement PlanSM sponsors.

Team



















Functioning much like the Mayo Clinic, Savant has hired the best and brightest specialists to create a synergistic and integrated team that is more effective collectively, than separately. The Advisory Team functions like the doctors who diagnose and prescribe; the Concierge Team functions like nurses who coordinate and manage work flow; the Implementation Team are like the pharmacists who fill the prescriptions to make client portfolios feel better; and the Administrative Team supervises and supports the other teams. See glossary of professional designations.
