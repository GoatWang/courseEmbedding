Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]

Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]

I was a little disappointed in the way the debt has run up, and I don't blame him for running up the debt in the recession, but I think we needed an exit strategy to get out of it. I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]


Play media


Brooks on PBS Newshour discussing the US Presidential election in 2016.


Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]
Personal life[edit]
Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]

Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]
Personal life[edit]
Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]

Brooks on PBS Newshour discussing the US Presidential election in 2016.


Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]
Personal life[edit]
Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]

Brooks on PBS Newshour discussing the US Presidential election in 2016.


Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]
Personal life[edit]
Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]

Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]

Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

Early life and education[edit]
Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario—his father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time—and spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Although his family was Jewish, Brooks himself is not religiously observant.[6][7][8][9] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[9]
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."[10] To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.[11]
Early career[edit]
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.[1] He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him[9] In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his being Jewish. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.[9]

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for The Washington Times.
Career[edit]

In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Allan Bloom's famous The Closing of the American Mind, which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.[1][5]

 Booknotes interview with Brooks on Bobos, July 30, 2000, C-SPAN


In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.”[9]

In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and he authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.[12] The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011[13] and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[21]
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.[22] In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility.[23]
In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.[24] He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.[25]
Political views[edit]


Play media


Brooks on PBS Newshour discussing the US Presidential election in 2016.


Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a "sophisticated pundit" ; one of "those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda."[26] When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke... and Alexander Hamilton."[27] In fact, Brooks read Edmund Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and "completely despised it," but "gradually over the next five to seven years... came to agree with him." Brooks claims that "my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself."[28] In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, "If it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating: "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."[27]
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses." He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free-market economist Milton Friedman.[6] As Brooks describes it, "[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but....”[29]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[30][31] In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as "a witheringly condescending column" portraying Senator Harry Reid "as an unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence."[32][33] By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts.[34] In 2015, Brooks wrote that "[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment" made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself.[35] Brooks wrote "many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no."[35] Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a "fable" the idea that "intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war."[35] Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that "[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty."[35]
His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance"[36] was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.[37]
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[38]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[39] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.[40] But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.[41]
In a March 2007, article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[42] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can’t still think it’s going to happen soon."[43]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. [...] I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[44] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer," explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."[28] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[45] However, in December 2011, during a CSPAN interview, Brooks' expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.[46] He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."[28] However, in a February 2016 New York Times Op-Ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.[47]
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[48] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since".[48] In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."[48][49]
In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled “The Nature of Poverty” specifically followed the social uproar caused by the Freddie Gray death, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are “matters of social psychology”.[50] When discussing Freddie Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was “not on the path to upward mobility”.[50]
In regards to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be “competent” and “normal” in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.[51][52] In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually become victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become “sick” of Donald Trump.[51][52]
When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op-ed he titled “No, Not Trump, Not Ever”. In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is “is epically unprepared to be president” and by pointing out Trump’s “steady obliviousness to accuracy”.[53]
Social views[edit]
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."[54]
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."[55]
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.[56]
On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.[57]
Criticisms[edit]
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual.[58][59] In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.[60] He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed...'[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of “taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said". Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I suck...I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.”[9] In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got 'nearly every detail' wrong about a poll of high-school students.[61]
Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".[62] Writing for Gawker, which has consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "Possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".[63] Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York Magazine, criticized Brooks’ statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used “some very tricksy, misleading math”.[64]
Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming Brooks argued his point by framing his sources’ arguments out of context and routinely making bold “half-right” assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.[65]
In 2016, James Taranto criticized[66] Brooks' analysis[67] of a U.S. Supreme Court case,[68] writing that "Brooks’s treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant".[66] Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks "distorts rather grotesquely" the case in question.[69] Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".[70]
Legacy[edit]
Sidney Awards[edit]
This article is about the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks. For the award presented by the Hillman Foundation, see The Sidney Award.
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called "The Hookies," the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.[71]
Personal life[edit]
Brooks met his first wife, the former Jane Hughes, while both were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism[72] and changed her given name to Sarah.[73] In November 2013, David and Sarah Brooks divorced.[74][75] In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder.[76]
According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces.[77]

I was a little disappointed in the way the debt has run up, and I don't blame him for running up the debt in the recession, but I think we needed an exit strategy to get out of it. I think he could have done a little more to promote growth, though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little corruption. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his right, but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.

David Brooks’s Search for Meaning | The New YorkerShopSign in|Link your subscriptionCultural CommentDavid Brooks’s Search for MeaningBy Rebecca MeadMay 27, 2015In the introduction to his new book, “The Road to Character,” David Brooks breaks the columnist’s fourth wall with a startling confession: “I was born with a natural disposition towards shallowness.” Brooks, who established a reputation for sometimes glib but often insightful cultural commentary with “Bobos in Paradise,” his 2000 best-seller, has more recently specialized in applying the latest in brain science and social psychology to larger questions of morality on the Op-Ed pages of the Times. He continues, “I’m paid to be a narcissistic blowhard, to volley my opinions, to appear more confident about them than I really am, to appear smarter than I really am, to appear better and more authoritative than I really am. I have to work harder than most people to avoid a life of smug superficiality.”“The Road to Character” is an account of Brooks’s effort to find his way out of shallow punditry—or, as he puts it, to “cultivate character.” To make his case, Brooks—who likes to reach for the occasionally effortful neologism—has come up with a pair of clarifying terms: the “résumé virtues” and the “eulogy virtues.” Résumé virtues, he proposes, are those that are valued in the contemporary marketplace: the high test scores achieved by a student, the professional accomplishments pulled off by an adult. They are the skills that are met with bigger paychecks and public approbation. Eulogy virtues, on the other hand, are the aspects of character that others praise when a person isn’t around to hear it: humility, kindness, bravery. Our society exalts the résumé virtues, Brooks argues, but it overlooks the humbler eulogy virtues. Still, he writes, we know at our core that this second category of values is what matters more.Or at least we come to realize this fact, often in midlife, perhaps while lost in the dark wood of insta-opinionizing. Such was Brooks’s course, he hints: he wrote “The Road to Character,” he declares, “to save my own soul.” Brooks does not dwell upon the specific depredations from which his soul was in need of rescue. Instead, he offers brief biographies of a range of historical figures whose lives illustrate the eulogy virtues he seeks to recover, and whose example may prove inspirational. He illuminates his case studies by quoting authorities as diverse as Aristotle, Kierkegaard, and Tina Brown. “I’m hoping you and I will both emerge from the next nine chapters slightly different and slightly better,” Brooks writes, slightly modestly.Brooks gives us Dwight Eisenhower, raised by a loving mother who nonetheless stressed discipline, as an exemplar of self-restraint. There is George Marshall, whose outward reserve was the expression of inward judiciousness. “Very rarely did he call anyone by their first name,” Brooks observes of Marshall, and then goes on to make a larger point about reticence: “The contents of the private world should not instantly be shared online or in conversation. They should not be tweeted.” The novelist George Eliot is included; her extramarital but deeply committed relationship with George Henry Lewes is given as an illustration of the redemptive, creative power of reciprocal, selfless love. (My own book about George Eliot, “My Life in Middlemarch,” is approvingly referenced in this chapter.)It would be a hard-hearted critic who dismisses another writer’s sincere attempt at midlife self-examination, or his efforts at moral and ethical improvement. (That being said, Brooks does so, snarking at Elizabeth Gilbert’s best-selling memoir, “Eat, Pray, Love.” “I am the only man ever to finish this book,” he writes, thereby insulting the author and more than ten million readers in one fell swoop.) There is something affecting in the diligence with which Brooks seeks a cure for his self-diagnosed shallowness by plumbing the depths of others, each of whom—while achieving greater fame and sometimes even greater fortune than that accrued by a successful newspaper columnist—did the hard work of scouring his own soul.Even if Brooks is the kind of writer who makes you want to preface your sentences with the phrase “Brooks isn’t wrong to point out,” Brooks isn’t wrong to point out that the examination of what comprises a moral life, an examination that came as second nature to his subjects, has fallen out of cultural favor, at least in the overachieving circles of the meritocracy. (Among literary essayists and their readers, however, it’s not quite such a taboo: consider the recent work of Leslie Jamison and Eula Biss.) “What the Victorians were to sex, we are to morality: everything is covered in euphemism,” he writes, with nice precision.What is the nature of the moral crisis that Brooks has identified? He argues that, from Biblical times right up until the mid-nineteen-forties, a culture of what he calls “moral realism” prevailed. According to Brooks, our elders emphasized the dangers of sin and the limitations of the individual, and they constructed useful religious and social institutions in an effort to encourage virtuous self-circumscription. In the eighteenth century, he goes on, moral realism was challenged by the new ideas of moral Romanticism, whereby the self was exalted rather than distrusted. He suggests that these two moral modes coexisted until the aftermath of the Second World War—an upheaval so cataclysmic that anyone who came out the other end of it was desperate for fun and pleasure. At that point, Brooks says, culture became re-centered on the self, spawning the likes of the permissive Doctor Spock and Norman Vincent Peale, whose book “The Power of Positive Thinking” “rested atop the Times [best-seller] list for an astounding ninety-eight weeks.”From then until now, Brooks argues, our society has devolved into an ever-increasing celebration of the self. Parents and schools nurture self-esteem, and value self-expression in offspring and students. The form of ambition our society celebrates is being true to oneself by pursuing one’s own passion. Broadcasting oneself through the construction of a social-media persona is nigh on compulsory; being “liked” matters even more to us than being well-liked did to Willy Loman. As a result, Brooks argues, we have become less empathetic, and more apt to regard our relationships with others in the light of useful expediency. We are living in the “Age of the Selfie,” Brooks notes, adding to the more than a hundred and forty thousand uses of that phrase already tallied by Google.At the same time, Brooks urges, it’s not too late to join a counterculture—“to live a decent life, to build up the soul.” To help his readers do so, he’s boldly provided at the end of his book a fifteen-point “Humility Code,” which includes the assertions “We don’t live for happiness, we live for holiness” and “pride is the central vice,” as well as the injunction “No good life is possible unless it is organized around a vocation.” And yet Brooks reassures his readers that the moral life, as he conceives it, need not require the kind of renunciation sought by St. Augustine, who is the subject of Chapter 8. “It doesn’t matter if you work on Wall Street or at a charity distributing medicine to the poor,” Brooks writes. “The most important thing is whether you are willing to engage in moral struggle against yourself.”It’s worth pausing here to note that, by privileging an internal struggle against oneself over one’s external actions toward others, Brooks would seem to be advocating just the kind of self-centeredness he otherwise laments. It’s also questionable to assert that working on Wall Street and serving the poor should be seen as morally equivalent. Brooks notes with dismay the growing ranks of college students who happily affirm that, upon graduation, they will aim for financial success over other possible goals. “Financial security, once seen as a middling value, is now tied as students’ top goal,” he writes. (Unfortunately, the study he cites to support this fact dates all the way back to 1990, when today’s new college graduates weren’t even born, though Brooks’s observation is surely buttressed by his interactions with students at Yale, where he has taught a class for several years.)But a young person’s sense that she is obliged to secure her financial future is not necessarily an indication of creeping greed and selfishness. It might equally be regarded as the inevitable result of an economy that ever more ruthlessly separates the rich from the poor. Or it could be the product of a society that provides less and less in the way of social support, then faults its more vulnerable members for their failure to get a toehold on the meritocratic ladder. It could be a consequence of a cultural climate in which doing a job that serves others—being a teacher or a social worker—is undervalued as a goal for the ambitious and high-achieving, and in which the acquisition of an expensive college degree is perceived as more and more necessary to pursue even the most altruistic of career goals. (Try landing a job as the person distributing medicine to the poor at a charity without a diploma.) Cultivating the eulogy virtues, at least in one’s professional life, is much harder to do with a full load of debt.Moreover, the very notion of “eulogy virtues” partakes in the crisis of selfishness that Brooks is busy decrying. In his chapter on George Eliot, Brooks cites the famous concluding passage of Eliot’s greatest novel, “Middlemarch,” concerning Eliot’s ardent heroine, Dorothea, with whose aspirations the book began: “But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.” Brooks is right to alight upon this passage: it’s a magnificent expression of a resonant theme. In Eliot’s characterization of Dorothea over the course of the nine hundred-odd pages of “Middlemarch,” a reader gradually witnesses an individual’s growth from debilitating self-centeredness to a larger, more profoundly gratifying empathy. Brooks’s instinct that there is wisdom to be found in literature that cannot be found in the pages of the latest social science journals is well-advised, and the possibility that his book may bring the likes of Eliot or Samuel Johnson—another literary figure about whom he writes with engaging sympathy—to a wider general readership is a heartening thought.But Eliot’s unvisited tombs, in their quiet, solemn modesty, present an image that is the very opposite of a what is implied by a eulogy—which is, after all, a very public affirmation and celebration of a life. Brooks hopes that readers of his book will find themselves inspired to pursue the so-called eulogy virtues with all the intensity with which they once sought the résumé virtues, as he says he has been inspired to do himself. But the avowed cultivator of eulogy virtues may still be hoping that, when he’s gone, others will sing his praises. A hidden life is a much more demanding prospect to accept, or to recommend.Most Popular1.Letter from ColoradoHow Trump Is Transforming Rural AmericaBy Peter Hessler2.News DeskWhat the Layoffs Look Like at the Carrier Plant Trump Said He’d SaveBy Charles Bethea3.News DeskA Conversation with the New York Times Reporter Maggie Haberman, Trump’s Favorite FoeBy David Remnick4.ElementsOne Man’s Two-Year Quest Not to Finish Final Fantasy VIIBy Simon Parkin5.CommentThe Meaning of the G.O.P.’s Health-Care FiascoBy Amy Davidson Sorkinour thirty most popularRecommended StoriesAmy Davidson SorkinDavid Brooks and the Mind of Edward SnowdenBy Amy Davidson SorkinJun. 11, 2013Amy Davidson SorkinDavid Brooks’s Gay-Marriage DelusionBy Amy Davidson SorkinApr. 03, 2013Cultural CommentWhat Michael Bloomberg Could Learn From “Middlemarch”By Rebecca MeadJul. 28, 2015Page-TurnerGeorge Eliot’s SuperfanBy Rebecca MeadJan. 24, 2014NewsCultureBooksBusiness & TechHumorCartoonsMagazineVideoPodcastsArchiveGoings OnShopSign inLink your subscription

How cured meats killed the American dream

David Brooks, a product of private schools and two affluent parents, faced the problem that bedevils many a newspaper columnist today:  He had a deadline and nothing to say. So he quickly — presumably — dashed off the tired criticism of affluent parents who are gaming the system for everyone else,  and titled it, “How We Are Ruining America.” Let’s be clear here: The affluent providing the best for their children while simultaneously denying even the faint aroma of equal treatment by the less fortunate is not only the entire history of America, it remains the inspiration of a large number of people who share Brooks’ title as “conservative.” “We in the educated class have created barriers to mobility that are more devastating for being invisible,” he writes. He means “liberals” when he says “educated class.” But let’s not even debate the notion that this is something new or whether it’s even real. It’s real and has been for generations. Had he taken more time to think about it, he might’ve postulated that America’s political polarization is based on our increasing tribal mentality that gives us the most comfort when we surround ourselves with like-minded individuals (note: Bill Bishop did that today in his Aspen Ideas Festival lecture, which was broadcast on MPR News Presents). There have been tougher struggles for some Americans besides not having the right baby stroller, but Brooks is going to make his stand on the funny names for cured meat. So let’s just focus on how weird this paragraph is, which he offers as proof of a country run amok: Recently I took a friend with only a high school degree to lunch. Insensitively, I led her into a gourmet sandwich shop. Suddenly I saw her face freeze up as she was confronted with sandwiches named “Padrino” and “Pomodoro” and ingredients like soppressata, capicollo and a striata baguette. I quickly asked her if she wanted to go somewhere else and she anxiously nodded yes and we ate Mexican. What kind of country do we live in when panicked people, faced with Italian names at a deli, scurry for safety at a Mexican joint? If you only have a “high school degree” and have pulled yourself up by your bootstraps to survive lunch at a deli, well, God bless America. Brooks could have considered an ongoing question in America: “Can you get ahead without other people falling farther behind?”  Instead, as is Brooks’ nature, he merely teed it up for Twitter.  really inspired by the NYT most recent David Brooks column pic.twitter.com/7vwZ3Y1g9y — Alex (@alexphastings) July 11, 2017   "David Brooks"At first she did ok with the Padrion, and even the Pomodoro, but when she saw the soppressata, and capicollo her face froze! pic.twitter.com/NH2XwevFR6 — NIK VENTURE (@NIK_VENTURE) July 11, 2017   Once, while working on a building that David Brooks now works in. One guy says "Hey, Any you got any Padrino Sandwiches"? Everyone laughed pic.twitter.com/BVjp52Nlrg — Hardhat Patriot (@Hardhat_Patriot) July 11, 2017   today's David Brooks column is worth reading pic.twitter.com/6UbURCmVAc — Simon Maloy (@SimonMaloy) July 11, 2017   this new David Brooks column contains multitudes. pic.twitter.com/itpnUT0KJg — Sabrina Imbler (@aznfusion) July 11, 2017   Everyone is overreacting to the @nytdavidbrooks op-ed.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of David Brooks can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month
