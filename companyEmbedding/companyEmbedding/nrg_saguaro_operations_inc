	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	     We have acted as special counsel to NRG Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company),
	in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the Registration Statement), filed on
	December 21, 2005 by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
	(the Act). The Registration Statement relates to the issuance and sale from time to time by the
	Company, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Act, of
	the following securities of the Company: (i) senior or subordinated debt securities, which may be
	secured or unsecured, in one or more series (the Debt Securities), to be issued under an
	Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2006 (the Indenture), between the Company and Law Debenture
	Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the Trustee), including (a) $1,200,000,000 aggregate
	principal amount of the Companys 7.250% Senior Notes due 2014 issued under the Indenture, as
	supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2006, among the Company,
	the Trustee and the Subsidiary Guarantors (the First Supplemental Indenture) and (b)
	$2,400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 (together,
	the Offered Debt Securities) issued under the Indenture, as supplemented by the Second
	Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2006, among the Company, the Trustee and the
	Subsidiary Guarantors (the Second Supplemental Indenture and, together with the First
	Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures); (ii) guarantees of the Debt Securities (the
	Subsidiary Guarantees) by subsidiaries of the Company, including guarantees of the Offered Debt
	Securities (the Offered Subsidiary Guarantees) by the subsidiaries of the Company incorporated or
	formed pursuant to the laws of the States of Delaware or California and listed on Schedule I hereto
	(the DE/CA Guarantors) and the subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule II hereto (the
	Non-DE/CA Guarantors and, together with

	value per share, of the Company (the Preferred Stock), in one or more series, including 2,000,000
	shares of the Companys 5.75% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
	issued by the Company on February 2, 2006 (the Offered Preferred Stock); (iv) shares of common
	stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (Common Stock), including 20,855,057 shares of

	indeterminate amount of Debt Securities and number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as
	may be issued upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any Debt Securities or Preferred Stock,
	including such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as may be issued pursuant to anti-dilution
	adjustments, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of offering. The Debt
	Securities, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock are collectively
	referred to herein as the Securities. The Offered Debt Securities were sold pursuant to an
	Underwriting Agreement, dated January 26, 2006 (the Debt Underwriting Agreement), among the
	Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Citigroup Global
	Markets Inc., as representatives (the Representatives) of the several Underwriters named on

	     We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our
	satisfaction, of such records of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and such agreements,
	certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company,
	the Subsidiary Guarantors and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or
	appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.


	     In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness
	of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity
	to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or
	photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to any facts material
	to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied
	upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company, the
	Subsidiary Guarantors and others and of public officials. In making our examination of executed
	documents or documents to be executed, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the
	Company and the DE/CA Guarantors, had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and
	perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite
	action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such

	documents, and, as to parties other than the Company and the DE/CA Guarantors, the validity
	and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have assumed that any Debt Securities, other than
	the Offered Debt Securities, that may be issued will be issued in a form that complies with the
	Indenture and will be manually signed or countersigned, as the case may be, by duly authorized
	officers of the Trustee. We have also assumed that each of the Non-DE/CA Guarantors has been duly
	organized and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the their respective
	jurisdiction of organization. In addition, we have also assumed that the terms of the Securities
	will have been established so as not to, and the terms of the Offered Debt Securities, the Offered
	Preferred Stock and the Offered Common Stock have been established so as not to, and that the
	execution and delivery by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of, and the performance of
	their obligations under, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures and the Securities, will not,
	violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the
	Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors is subject, (ii) any law, rule or regulation to which
	the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors is subject, (iii) any judicial or regulatory order
	or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or
	validation of, or filing, recording or registration with any governmental authority. We have also
	assumed that (i) the stock certificates evidencing the Preferred Stock to be issued by the Company
	(other than the Offered Preferred Stock) will be in a form that complies with, and the terms of
	such Preferred Stock will be duly established in accordance with, the Delaware General Corporation
	Law (the DGCL), and (ii) the stock certificate evidencing any Common Stock issued by the Company
	(other than the Offered Common Stock) will conform to the specimen certificate examined by us and
	will be duly executed and delivered.


	     Our opinions set forth below are limited to the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and
	those laws of the State of California and the State of New York that, in our experience, are
	normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and to
	the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses,
	authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are
	relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as Opined on
	Law). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined
	on Law or as to the effect of any such non-Opined on Law on the opinions herein stated. The
	Securities may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis, and this opinion is
	limited to the laws, including the rules and regulations, as in effect on the date hereof, which
	laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.


	     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the other qualifications and limitations set
	forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

	With respect to any series of Debt Securities offered by the Company, other than with respect
	to the Offered Debt Securities, when (i) an appropriate prospectus

	been prepared, delivered and filed in compliance with the Act and the applicable rules and

	pursuant to a firm commitment underwritten offering, the underwriting agreement with
	respect to such Debt Securities has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
	Company and the other parties thereto; (iii) the Board of Directors, including any
	appropriate committee appointed thereby, and appropriate officers of the Company have taken

	(including any Debt Securities duly issued upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any

	any supplemental indenture to be entered into in connection with the issuance of such Debt
	Securities and the applicable underwriting agreement, if any, or any other duly authorized,
	executed and delivered valid and binding purchase or agency agreement, will be valid and
	binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
	their respective terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (a)
	bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
	laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally, (b) general
	principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
	law or in equity), (c) public policy considerations which may limit the rights of parties
	to obtain remedies, (d) the waivers of any usury defense contained in the Indenture or Debt
	Securities offered by the Company that may be unenforceable, (e) requirements that a claim
	with respect to any Debt Securities offered by the Company denominated in a currency,
	currency unit or composite currency other than United States dollars (or a judgment
	denominated other than in United States dollars in respect of such claim) be converted into
	United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to
	applicable law, and (f) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of
	payments outside the United States or in foreign currencies, currency units or composite
