Entegrion Announces Organizational Changes to Support Advanced Product Development
>PRWEB.COM Newswire




Research Triangle Park, NC (PRWEB) June 19, 2013  North Carolina-based life sciences company Entegrion, Inc., announced organizational changes to advance development of its technologies.
Entegrion’s Executive Chairman John B. Mowell said, “To support the advanced development of our product candidates Entegrion’s Board of Directors has made changes to the Company’s management structure and engaged industry leaders as key advisors.”  
The Company announced that Michael Galiger will serve as Vice President of Operations with primary responsibility for development of Entegrion’s plasma product Resusix, as well as supporting the continued advancement of the Company’s other technologies. “Mike’s technical background, intensive work with the development of Entegrion’s products, and his success in attracting a solid product development team, including Stacy Hammonds as Director of Clinical Operations, and Taegen Sullivan, Product Development Engineer, have made a substantial contribution to Entegrion’s success,” Mowell continued.  
Entegrion also announced the formation of a clinical advisory Board initially comprised of Paul Ness, MD, Director of Transfusion Medicine at Johns Hopkins; Professor Peter Rhee, MD, Chief of Trauma, Critical Care, Burns and Emergency Surgery, University of Arizona; Edward Scott, MD, President of Key Biologics; and Philip C. Spinella, MD, Director, Pediatric Critical Care Translational Research Program, Washington University, St. Louis.
“We are immensely proud to be associated with these world-class leaders in transfusion and trauma medicine.  Drs. Rhee and Spinella both came out of the Armed Forces and served in Iraq.  They will bring a unique ‘user perspective’ to our technologies.  Dr. Scott has decades of experience with the supply of blood and blood derivatives, and Dr. Ness is an expert in transfusion medicine. Their guidance will be invaluable as our biologic and medical device technologies move into advanced development,” Mowell said.
Entegrion also announced that Richard Martin will serve as Executive Vice President with responsibility for Entegrion’s overall day-to-day business operations reporting to the Executive Chairman, and will assist in the areas of strategic corporate planning and development. Susan Reyer, the Company’s Controller for the past five years, now serves as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, with responsibility for the Company’s financial and administrative matters. 
Joseph DaCorta will continue in his role as Chief Technology Officer, with responsibility for managing Entegrion’s government relations and exploring new opportunities to utilize the Company’s technologies.   Arthur Bode continues to serve as Vice President, Chief Science Officer in charge of scientific research and project support.  
Mowell stated, “We are fortunate that each of the senior members of our management team have been integral to the company’s operations for a number of years, positioning Entegrion well for continued success.”
Over the past three years, Entegrion has announced Department of Defense contract awards totaling more than $50 million for the development of resuscitation and coagulation technologies that have important healthcare applications for US Armed Forces.

Stasix®





When bleeding is caused by low platelet counts or platelet dysfunction, the medical team needs immediate access to platelets that provide predictable, consistent function.
Stasix® is a pharmaceutical agent derived from human platelets that provides more consistent cellular hemostatic function than liquid-stored, banked platelets. The stabilization steps used in processing Stasix® also provide pathogen reduction, and the freeze-drying enables truly long-term storage with greater ease of use and availability than banked technologies.
The hemostatic agent in pre-clinical development by Entegrion overcomes the storage limitations of fresh platelets because it is freeze-dried for shelf-stable storage. When needed for use in a patient, the sterile agent can be rapidly and conveniently rehydrated and infused.
While currently in development, Stasix® will serve many markets once it is commercialized. As a hemostatic agent, Stasix® can provide targeted hemostasis to areas of non-compressible bleeding. In addition, Stasix® has a projected shelf life of 4-5 years, which exceeds storage for liquid, banked platelets that currently expire after 2 weeks. This extended shelf life can provide a hospital with a logistical advantage to the current standard of care, saving both time and resources in today’s constrained health care systems.
A key platform technology—Stasix® is one of the technologies in the hemostatic patch under development by Entegrion. Also, the particles in Stasix® can be loaded with imaging and highly cytotoxic materials for targeted delivery to areas of vascular injury. This capability allows Stasix® to be activated for specific tasks with extensive possibilities from diagnostics to therapeutic treatment.

 




our goal is to offer a preferred alternative to liquid-stored, banked platelets with improved bacterial safety, antigenicity and reliable function.

Entegrion continually seeks collaborations with premier organizations closely aligned with our mission to advance the safety and availability of human-derived therapeutics. We welcome discussions on alliances, licensing and joint ventures.
Leading Research Institutions
We are privileged to work with an impressive group of medical research facilities and look forward to growing our base of research partners.

University of North Carolina. Our initial partnership with UNC was a natural occurrence due to the strong relationship that Entegrion’s Dr. Arthur Bode has with his alma mater. Over the years, we expanded our relationships within UNC and to other institutions.

Among the institutions that have contributed to our product advancement through in vitro and in vivo studies and product evaluation are:

Virginia Commonwealth University
Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital 
University of Texas at Houston
East Carolina University
Naval Medical Research Center
Blood Systems Research Institute





Corporate Partners
Kedrion has formalized agreements with Entegrion in support of our Resusix™ project. Kedrion’s solvent detergent treated plasma serves as the precursor to Resusix™, and the company’s technical competencies helped Resusix™ advance to IND within 3 years of product concept.
Beeken Biomedical is a diversified wound care company located in Pennsylvania that licensed Entegrion’s Stasilon®, a dual fiber, minimally adherent hemostatic textile that supports rapid hemostasis of bleeding surfaces. Beeken now exclusively markets and distributes Stasilon®.
Government Partners
Office of Naval Research (ONR) provided the initial funding for Resusix™ from concept through phase 1 trials and provided the initial funding for our MRF.
Defense Medical Research and Development Program (DMRDP) provided additional funding for Resusix™.
Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP)  through the Secretary of Defense provided the final funding for Resusix™ as well as funding for our PCM.
Entegrion complies with applicable Federal Conflict of Interest rules.

Resusix™





A safe, effective, alternative to Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is needed for the immediate treatment of patients with severe hemorrhage.
Resusix® is being developed by Entegrion to provide a reliable source of coagulation factors and volume replacement available immediately, wherever needed. For patients who need blood clotting proteins restored or supplemented very quickly, the rapidly ready-to-use hemostatic volume resuscitation therapeutic offers a life-saving treatment option.
Derived from human plasma, Resusix® is solvent detergent-treated and spray-dried to provide a safe, shelf-stable, readily available plasma product.
Easy-to-use and fully portable, Resusix® offers a valuable advantage in remote and austere military and civilian settings. With an extended shelf life of more than two years, the longer storage capacity breaks the cold chain restrictions of frozen blood plasma, which is the current standard of care.
Resusix® also provides a safer alternative to FFP. Free of micro particles and cell fragments commonly found in FFP, Resusix® inactivates harmful viruses like hepatitis B, C and HIV. Pooling of multiple donors allows Resusix® to be a true plasma-derived therapeutic, standardized to human norms and free of individual  variability that is common in FFP.  Resusix®. provides clinicians with identity, potency, purity, and safety information that supports informed decision-making.
When Resusix® is commercially available, the dehydrated plasma and reconstitution fluid will be packaged together for rapid combination when needed for immediate use.

 




our goal is to demonstrate enhanced safety and equivalent efficacy for transfusion recipients. Resusix® inactivates enveloped viruses and removes bacteria and pro-inflammatory factors that can lead to serious consequences, including morbidity and mortality.
