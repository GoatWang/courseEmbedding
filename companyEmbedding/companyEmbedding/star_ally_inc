(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2: - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward-Looking Statements  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are projections of events, revenues, income, future economic performance or management's plans and objectives for future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes statements about:  � our marketing plan;  � our plans to hire industry experts and expand our management team;  � our beliefs regarding the future of our competitors;  � our anticipated development schedule;  � the anticipated benefits of our product;  � our expectation that the demand for our products will eventually increase; and  � our expectation that we will be able to raise capital when we need it.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including:  � general economic and business conditions;  � we may have product liability claims;  � we may not be successful in commercialization of our products;  � regulatory changes may hurt the market for our products;  � we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights;  � our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding our company;  � competition for, among other things, capital, products and skilled personnel; and  � other factors discussed under the section entitled "Risk Factors",  any of which may cause our company's or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  While these forward-looking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  As used in this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" mean Star Ally Inc., a Nevada corporation. In this report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  History and Overview  Star Ally Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  Plan of Operations  We were in the business of developing software including gaming products (poker games)and after the appointment of Mr. Andy Kim as CEO of the Company on July 8, 2016, he inclined to terminate the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence "binary". Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.  Results of Operations  The following is an analysis of our revenues, and analysis of components of expenses, and variances comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We are in our infancy stage and have not generated any revenue from our core business model. Our total operating expenses during those periods were general and administrative expense of $25,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $73,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $500 compared to $631 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,765 compared to $33,158 for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in operating expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding the stock based compensation paid in 2015, is due, primarily, to reduced professional fees.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we utilized cash in the amount of $20,861 to pay for operating activities compared to $46,208 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a net loss of $26,265 compared to a net loss of $74,189 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included amortization of intangible asset in the amount of $1,600 and a non-cash written back of loan and other payables, compared to amortization of $1,600 and a non-cash stock based compensation expense of $27,500, for the same nine months in 2015. Accounts and other payable increased and provided cash of $3,804 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash utilized of $1,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Investing Activities  We did not use any cash resources for investing activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  Financing Activities  We generate $9,210 from financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash generated from a related party loan and sale of common stock of $50,000 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  Working Capital Needs:  As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $7,306. Over the next 12 months, we will require approximately $75,000 to sustain our working capital needs as a public reporting company and to further develop our web and bricks and mortar products.  Sources of Capital:  We expect to obtain financing through the sale of restricted common shares, shareholder loans, and a potential line of credit. The sale of common shares will be priced based on current market activity. Shareholder loans, depending on circumstances, may be without stated terms of repayment or interest. Because a line of credit is not currently being investigated, its terms will depend on the lender at the time of commitment. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time.  Plan of Operations:  We are in the infancy stage of developing our products. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 2, 2013, to engage in the development and distribution of poker games. We have generated no revenues from business operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs. Accordingly, we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational costs.  Our former director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company. On July 8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr. Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence "binary". Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.  On August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a vacant position on the Company's Board of Directors. Jun Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO, Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director of the Company.  Material Commitments  We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.  Seasonal Aspects  Management is not currently aware of any seasonal aspects which would affect the results of our operations during any particular time of year.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off balance sheet arrangements.  Going Concern  We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or equity financing.  Nov 17, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	Star Ally Inc.


	(formerly Reraise Gaming Corporation)


	Notes to

	Unaudited

	Financial Statements


	For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015








	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS





	Star Ally Inc. (formerly known as Reraise Gaming Corporation), (the “Company”) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, was incorporated on October 2, 2013, in the State of Nevada. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has acquired a variety of poker games, some with patents and some with patents pending, in addition to those we are developing. Each of the games has been acquired or is being developed for different segments of the poker market, namely video poker, brick and mortar, as well as online poker. Several of the games are available on line, at no charge, to test their viability.





	Our former director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company

	.

	 

	O

	n July 8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr. Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence “binary”.  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.





	On August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a vacant position on the Company’s Board of Directors. Jun Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO, Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director of the Company.





	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Basis of Presentation



	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, contained in the Company's Form 10K, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 








	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN





	The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, The Company has been engaged substantially in financing activities and developing its business plan and marketing. As a result, the Company incurred an accumulated deficit of $2,799,212. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of capital stock and capital contributions from a note holder.





	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock or through debt financing and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.








	NOTE 4

	–

	COMMITMENT





	On May 21, 2014 the Company entered into an agreement with Chris Moneymaker, an individual to use his name and likeness alongside a brief positive quote on the Company's website, paraphernalia or literature. In exchange, the Company will compensate Chris Moneymaker the following:

	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.





	History and Overview





	Star Ally Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.


	 


	Plan of Operations





	We were in the business of developing software including gaming products (poker games)and after the appointment of Mr. Andy Kim as CEO of the Company on July 8, 2016, he inclined to terminate the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence

	“

	binary”.  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.

	Results of Operations





	The following is an analysis of our revenues, and analysis of components of expenses, and variances comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.





	We are in our infancy stage and have not generated any revenue from our core business model. Our total operating expenses during those periods were general and administrative expense of $25,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $73,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $500 compared to $631 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,765 compared to $33,158 for the same period in 2015.





	The decrease in operating expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding the stock based compensation paid in 2015, is due, primarily, to reduced professional fees.





	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we utilized cash in the amount of $20,861 to pay for operating activities compared to $46,208 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a net loss of $26,265 compared to a net loss of $74,189 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included amortization of intangible asset in the amount of $1,600 and a non-cash written back of loan and other payables, compared to amortization of $1,600 and a non-cash stock based compensation expense of $27,500, for the same nine months in 2015. Accounts and other payable increased and provided cash of $

	3


	,804

	for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash utilized of $1,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.





	Investing Activities





	We did not use any cash resources for investing activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015


	 


	Financing Activities


	 


	We generate $9,210 from financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash generated from a related party loan and sale of common stock of $50,000 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.





	Working Capital Needs

	:






	As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $7,306. Over the next 12 months, we will require approximately $75,000 to sustain our working capital needs as a public reporting company and to further develop our web and bricks and mortar products.





	Sources of Capital:





	We expect to obtain financing through the sale of restricted common shares, shareholder loans, and a potential line of credit. The sale of common shares will be priced based on current market activity. Shareholder loans, depending on circumstances, may be without stated terms of repayment or interest. Because a line of credit is not currently being investigated, its terms will depend on the lender at the time of commitment. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time.

	Plan of Operations:





	We are in the infancy stage of developing our products. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 2, 2013, to engage in the development and distribution of poker games. We have generated no revenues from business operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs. Accordingly, we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational costs.





	Our former director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company

	.

	 

	O

	n July 8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr. Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence “binary”.  Our detailed plan of operation consists of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks, apply for international patents and trademarks and market the software to the binary option industry.





	On August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a vacant position on the Company’s Board of Directors. Jun Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO, Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director of the Company.





	Material Commitments


	 


	We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.





	Seasonal Aspects





	Management is not currently aware of any seasonal aspects which would affect the results of our operations during any particular time of year.





	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements





	We have no off balance sheet arrangements.





	Going Concern





	We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or equity financing.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Nugent reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 1 star · April 17 · Very poor experience from this poorly ran organization.  We have tried the body cameras (they do not work), we have DVM 400's and DVM 800's units and they too do not work properly.  Problem after problem and we have lost evidence because of their poor products.    When we call the tech support office, we are met with friendly staff who are obviously not adequately trained to troubleshoot the issues with such a poor product.  I feel bad for their ground level employees, as the...y must certainly be frustrated with the lack of leadership within this organization.  This company is more focused on playing golf and marketing themselves to "help" first responders.  The poor service starts with customer care and their unwillingness to do the right things for his customers.  Take a moment to Google this company and their fiscal problems before you spend a single moment with "Customer Care Manager."   Several employees that proved to be the most helpful, no longer work for this company.  You have to wonder why.  Still waiting on return calls and emails. See MoreJason Frank reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 5 star · February 25 · We are the premier installers for digital ally cameras in NJ and NY and PA and if you have any issues or need them installed, please contact us.  Honestly my police dept has these in all our cars and they work great. I really think as long as everyone is trained properly in how to use the cameras, you have zero issues.  We have installed them in police cars and ambulances and they are a great product!Tyler Sewald reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 1 star · December 20, 2016 · We have two of these in car systems in our patrol vehicles.   The older product works much better than the new one.   The new system stopped working within 6 months of installing it.   They sent replacement parts which corrected the problem for a few months.   Now it's not working again.  I called and emailed to file a warranty claim.   They responded AFTER the warranty expired and refused to honor the claim.   When I asked about the possibility of sending the unit back and paying to upgrade to a better model they told me they would give me a credit of 25% for it.   Come to find out the system they sold us is exactly the same price of the newer model.   Very poor customer service.   Now I have to answer for the grant money spent to purchase this piece of crap.  Save your money.Jason McConnehey reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 2 star · November 29, 2016 · If the product worked on a consistent basis, then I would give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, there is ALWAYS something wrong with the product.  I have no experience with their body worn camera's, but I'm not impressed with the in-car cameras.  There is always something wrong, either on the software side or the hardware side.  Other departments in the area use another brand that is much more stable. It's not as fancy as the Digital Ally, but the other brand works when you need it to work.  Even our installer (which covers most  of the Bay Area) doesn't like this product very much.Robert Cox reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 1 star · July 25, 2016 · Body cams quit working after one day. In car cams quit working in a short period of time. Was originally told it was a software issue. Body cams were returned to company and when we got them back, the same thing happened, quit working after one shift. Company representative refuses to return calls or emails. Three other agencies having the same issues with the equipment and service.Courtney Forster reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 5 star · December 4, 2015 · My husband  is an employee with Digital Ally! They are such an amazing company! I know because my husband is constantly coming home and telling me how much he loves working here! Not to mention he gets to play a big role in protecting our officers and officers all over the world! What an honor! As a wife of a wonderful husband and 4 beautiful boys it's great and relieving to have a happy husband in the evennings and to hear about relationships that are being made! Thank you Digital Ally for blessing our family, and for what you do! We appreciate you!Jeff Mikesell reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 1 star · March 20, 2015 · Tried to use the system, called customer support, and they said it was too close to him to go home, and wanted me to call back on a Monday. Spoke to LJ, and he was much less than helpful. I would NOT purchase this product due to the fact it is complicated to install the software, and they have zero customer service. I would look at the body camera Taser International sells, they have friendly and helpful tech support.Mike Odom reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 5 star · July 15, 2013 · These guys make some great products, "worth their weight in gold" as a Dallas County, MO deputy told me.Jared Walker reviewed Digital Ally, Inc. — 5 star · September 19, 2014 · Very nice equipment..

(formerly

Notes to
Unaudited Financial Statements

For the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

 

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

 

Star Ally
Inc. (formerly known as Reraise Gaming Corporation), (the
“Company”) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, was
incorporated on October 2, 2013, in the State of Nevada. As of
September 30, 2016 the Company has acquired a variety of poker
games, some with patents and some with patents pending, in addition
to those we are developing. Each of the games has been acquired or
is being developed for different segments of the poker market,
namely video poker, brick and mortar, as well as online poker.
Several of the games are available on line, at no charge, to test
their viability.

 

Our former
director Mr. Ron Camacho resigned as President and Chief Executive
Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company .   O n July
8, 2016 and Mr. Andy Kim was appointed as President and Chief
Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer on the same date. Mr.
Kim expressed that he will end the development and distribution of
poker game and will shift focus to develop the binary option
software, a financial software for the trading of binary option. A
binary option, or asset-or-nothing option, is type of option in
which the payoff is structured to be either a fixed amount of
compensation if the option expires in the money, or nothing at all
if the option expires out of the money. The success of a binary
option is thus based on a yes or no proposition, hence
“binary”.  Our detailed plan of operation consists
of developing the software, applying for patents and trademarks,
apply for international patents and trademarks and market the
software to the binary option industry.

 

On August
15, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jung Choung Hun to a
vacant position on the Company’s Board of Directors. Jun
Choung Hun was also appointed to the position of President, Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), Secretary, Treasurer and Executive
Director, replacing Andy Kim, who resigned as President, CEO,
Secretary and Treasurer. There was no disagreement between the
Company and Andy Kim, and Mr. Kim retains his position as Director
of the Company.

 

NOTE 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of
Presentation

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, contained in the
Company's Form 10K, originally filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position and the results of operations for the interim periods
presented have been reflected herein.  The results of
operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. 

 

 

NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business, The Company has been
engaged substantially in financing activities and developing its
business plan and marketing. As a result, the Company incurred an
accumulated deficit of $2,799,212. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise
substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. The Company's development activities since inception
have been financially sustained through the sale of capital stock
and capital contributions from a note holder.

 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of
common stock or through debt financing and, ultimately, the
achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty.

 

 

NOTE 4
– COMMITMENT

 

On May 21,
2014 the Company entered into an agreement with Chris Moneymaker,
an individual to use his name and likeness alongside a brief
positive quote on the Company's website, paraphernalia or
literature. In exchange, the Company will compensate Chris
Moneymaker the following:

NOTE 5
– INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 

During the
year ended December 31, 2014, and as part of its marketing strategy
to acquaint users with its product, the Company has undertaken to
build its own interactive website. The Company capitalized website
development costs of $6,400 for the period from January 1, 2014
through website launch on September 1, 2014. The Company's
capitalized website amortization is included in general and
administrative expenses in the Company's statements of operations,
and totaled $1,600 and $1,600 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Intangible assets consist of the
unamortized portion of capitalized website development
costs.  

 

NOTE 6
– RELATED TRANSACTIONS

 

During the
year, December 31, 2013, the Company accrued expenses for $30,000
