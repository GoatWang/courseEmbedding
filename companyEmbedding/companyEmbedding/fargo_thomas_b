Biography[edit]
Born in San Diego, California, in June 1948, Fargo attended high school in Coronado, California, and Sasebo, Japan, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1970.
His father, Thomas A. Boulton, was a naval officer who was killed in a plane crash in 1957. His mother, Helen, remarried in 1960 to Captain William Fargo, US Navy. Helen was a Lieutenant in the US Navy Nurse Corps during World War II; both Thomas and William graduated from the Naval Academy (Class of 1943 and Class of 1939, respectively.)[2]
Trained in joint, naval and submarine commands, Fargo served in a variety of sea and shore duty assignments. At sea, his five assignments in both attack and ballistic missile submarines included Executive Officer aboard Plunger and Commanding Officer of Salt Lake City. He served as Commander, Submarine Group SEVEN, Commander Task Force SEVEN FOUR, and Commander Task Force ONE FIVE SEVEN in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf from 1992 to 1993. He commanded the United States FIFTH Fleet and Naval Forces of the Central Command during two years of Iraqi contingency operations from July 1996 to July 1998. Fargo served as the 29th Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet from October 1999 to May 2002.
Ashore, Fargo served in the Bureau of Naval Personnel and with the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet and has had multiple assignments in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. After his selection to Flag rank in 1994, Admiral Fargo has served as Director of Operations (J-3), U.S. Atlantic Command during the Haiti intervention; as Director, Assessment Division (N-81) for the Chief of Naval Operations; and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations (N3/N5).
While serving as Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), Fargo informed the United States Congress of his plans to retire from the Navy. A United States Air Force flag officer was nominated to succeed him. However, an uproar was created in the Senate as it was customary for a Navy flag officer to serve as Commander of PACOM and no other branches, thus the Air Force general was not confirmed by the Senate. Because of the lack of an immediate successor, President Bush extended the mandatory retirement date for Fargo. Admiral Fargo retired from military service in 2005 when the Senate confirmed Admiral William J. Fallon to succeed him as Commander of USPACOM.
Admiral Fargo is a 1989 recipient of the Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale Award for Inspirational Leadership. His personal decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal (four awards), the Defense Superior Service Medal and the Legion of Merit (three awards). In February 2005 he was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia, "for distinguished naval service, particularly for strengthening the Australia-United States alliance whilst Commander United States Pacific Command".[3]
In 2010, the National Bureau of Asian Research appointed Admiral Fargo as the second holder Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies,[4] a chair that was set up to honor General John Shalikashvili.
The Hunt for Red October[edit]
Admiral Fargo served as the inspiration for the character of "Commander Bart Mancuso" in the film The Hunt for Red October. Scott Glenn spent several days preparing for his role aboard the Salt Lake City. It was during this time that he decided to base his portrayal of his character on then-Commander Fargo.[5]
Fargo had told Glenn, "I've given orders to all the men on board to treat you as equal rank with me so every time for the next few days while we are out, when someone comes up and reports to me, they are going to turn around and report to you, and I'm going to tell you what we are going to do about it. There may be once or twice that I'm going to ask you to go to your quarters when we are dealing with stuff that is top secret."[6]
"Tom Fargo was a strong, tough commander, but he had a degree of relaxation and looseness that I never would have expected." – Scott Glenn.[6]
"He was incredibly confident...he was this guy you would follow into hell." – Alec Baldwin.[6]

LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., July 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:   GBX) announced today the election of four-star U.S. Navy Admiral Thomas B. Fargo to the Company's Board of Directors.  The election of Admiral Fargo increases Greenbrier's Board of Directors to 10 members, eight of whom are independent directors.  
Admiral Fargo, who completed his active military service in 2005, brings 35 years of naval leadership and subsequent private sector experience in maritime and other transportation industries to the Greenbrier Board. 
As commander of the U.S. Pacific Command from 2002 until 2005, Admiral Fargo led the world's largest unified command while directing the joint operations of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. In this role Admiral Fargo acted as U.S. military representative for collective defense arrangements in the Pacific, ultimately responsible to the President and the Secretary of Defense through the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Admiral Fargo's naval career included six tours in Washington, D.C. and extensive duties in the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Middle East including serving as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and Commander of the Naval Forces of the Central Command.
Admiral Fargo serves as Chairman of Huntington Ingalls Industries, America's largest military shipbuilder, and on the Boards of Directors for Hawaiian Electric Industries, Matson and United States Automobile Association. Previously he served on the Boards of Northrop Grumman Corporation and Hawaiian Airlines. 
"Admiral Fargo brings extensive experience in maritime operations and manufacturing that will directly benefit our Marine products business.  Also, Admiral Fargo's work throughout the world during his military command will be invaluable to Greenbrier as we extend our global reach to address new markets in South America and the Middle East," said William A. Furman, chairman and chief executive officer of Greenbrier.  "Along with the entire Greenbrier Board, I look forward to working closely with Admiral Fargo as we deploy his leadership abilities and strategic skills to advance Greenbrier's long-term objectives."

LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., July 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:   GBX) announced today the election of four-star U.S. Navy Admiral Thomas B. Fargo to the Company's Board of Directors.  The election of Admiral Fargo increases Greenbrier's Board of Directors to 10 members, eight of whom are independent directors.  
Admiral Fargo, who completed his active military service in 2005, brings 35 years of naval leadership and subsequent private sector experience in maritime and other transportation industries to the Greenbrier Board. 
As commander of the U.S. Pacific Command from 2002 until 2005, Admiral Fargo led the world's largest unified command while directing the joint operations of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. In this role Admiral Fargo acted as U.S. military representative for collective defense arrangements in the Pacific, ultimately responsible to the President and the Secretary of Defense through the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Admiral Fargo's naval career included six tours in Washington, D.C. and extensive duties in the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Middle East including serving as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and Commander of the Naval Forces of the Central Command.
Admiral Fargo serves as Chairman of Huntington Ingalls Industries, America's largest military shipbuilder, and on the Boards of Directors for Hawaiian Electric Industries, Matson and United States Automobile Association. Previously he served on the Boards of Northrop Grumman Corporation and Hawaiian Airlines. 
"Admiral Fargo brings extensive experience in maritime operations and manufacturing that will directly benefit our Marine products business.  Also, Admiral Fargo's work throughout the world during his military command will be invaluable to Greenbrier as we extend our global reach to address new markets in South America and the Middle East," said William A. Furman, chairman and chief executive officer of Greenbrier.  "Along with the entire Greenbrier Board, I look forward to working closely with Admiral Fargo as we deploy his leadership abilities and strategic skills to advance Greenbrier's long-term objectives."
