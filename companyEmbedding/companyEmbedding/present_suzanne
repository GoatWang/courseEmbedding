Healing From the Core, Full Body Presence, and Continuum & the Healing Process





A short message from Suzanne about our Products






Read a transcript of this videoThanks for checking out our products page.
We have something for almost everyone. There is downloadable audio as well as actual hard copy CDs you can purchase of all my Healing From the Core work. There’s my book, Full Body Presence on audio, read by me, as well as the eBook version which is downloadable right now.
For viewing pleasure and learning – we have hours and hours of DVD sets, with actual class room footage of Emilie Conrad and myself teaching together across 13 years – spanning a huge range of topics from things like how to work successfully with trauma, two DVD sets – two different classes – on creating more resilience in your immune system, a healthy visual system, the essence of the heart and lots more. We did our best to bring you the hands on magic of CranioSacral touch, combined with Emilie’s brilliance on movement, breath and sound. So, browse around! Every month we run a sale on one of the DVD sets – check out which one we have for sale this month. Save $50 month after month. If you don’t see what you want – let us know!
And, enjoy!

This two CD audio set grew out of Suzanne's annual trips to Sedona at the start of each New Year. This set provides a structure for those who want to create positive change in their lives, or are at a new beginning point. You can use it individually or in a group. It will assist you in integrating all facets of your life - your inner relationship with yourself, your connection to your spiritual life, family and community, career, creativity, abundance, health, power, sexuality and the ability to forgive and let go. The structure uses thought provoking questions and time for journaling with the exquisitely beautiful flute music of Jesse Kalu in the background. This process helps open the channels of intuition and communication, which are fundamental for successfully moving through all of life’s transitions and new beginnings.

Emilie Conrad & Suzanne Scurlock-Durana

Filmed in Reston Virginia, October 27-31, 2006
This professionally filmed DVD series offers a profound look at the essence of the heart and its contribution to living joyfully.

Our sense of connection to life, compassion and love, patience and forgiveness all come from an open, healthy heart. Emilie presents breath and intrinsic movement sequences as they relate to the heart. Suzanne presents the anatomy, inner guided explorations, and hands-on protocols. Come away with a deeper, clearer connection to your own heart, as well as how to hold a healing space for another.

This audio is a complete excerpt of Session #2 from the Comprehensive 10-session series Healing From the Core: A Journey Home to Ourselves - with three Full Body Presence Audio Explorations, each read by Suzanne Scurlock-Durana. It is particularly useful for those who desire more grounding & filling exercises to complement their copy of Full Body Presence. If you would like to take your practice to an advanced level, we recommend the comprehensive series.
The 40-minute session is the cornerstone of the Comprehensive series. It takes you deep into the energy field within the body, and gives you the tools, knowledge, sensory cues and imagery to build or enhance your own energy field. The second and third segments of this session are meant to be used once the longer exploration feels comfortable. The two shorter explorations (#2 - 17 minutes, #3 - 10 minutes) give you more concise exercises in order to be practical and useful on a daily basis.

Filmed in Reston Virginia, October 26-30, 2007
This professionally filmed DVD series offers a unique course that will allow each person to discover the intimate connection between brain function and body intelligence. Through research and clinical evidence, functions previously believed to originate in the brain alone, are being discovered all over the body: immune function, neurological capacity and endorphin production, to name just a few. The brain, as well as the rest of the body is able to change and grow throughout life. This neuroplasticity can be stimulated in a number of ways. Suzanne and Emilie explore many of these avenues in this series, enhancing physical, mental and emotional vitality. The ability to hear, see, think and feel in fresh ways changes the circumstance of our daily lives - gifting us with a renewed wonder that awakens us to more nuanced realms of existence. For those in healthcare, teachings, or caretaking roles, learn how to refresh yourself on a daily basis and how to allow yourself to receive more deeply.

In both, Emilie presents intrinsic movement sequences as they relate to the differing components of the immune system. Suzanne presents the anatomy and hands-on protocols.

Suzanne Collins Biography Since 1991, Suzanne has worked on the sets of several Nickelodeon Shows including Clarissa Explains It All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. Penned multiple stories for Little Bear and Oswald. Currently lives in Connecticut with her family. Grew up all over the world due to the fact that her father was in the military.  Grew up loving Greek Mytholody. Doesn't think she'd win the Hunger Games if she was in them. Will be releasing her next book in the Hunger Game series, Mockingjay, in August of 2010. When Suzanne was 6, her father was gone for the entire year - in Vietnam. Found it easy to write from the view point of Gregor since she had so many friends that were boys when she was Gregor's age.  Enjoyed gymnastics, reading, and running as a young adolescent. Loves bats, chocolate, and water! Has two older sisters and one older brother.  Lived in New York City for sixteen years.  Interview Print Interview - www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/events.htm Things that she and Gregor are a lot alike. They both want to do the right thing, and they have both changed a lot of dirty diapers. Lived in New York City for 16 years. Her father was in the Air Force and therefore she and her family moved around a lot. Is unsure as to whether or not she was destined to be an author, but she does think it would be very fascinating to have dinner with Ripred, a character from her Gregor series. Media Interview This interview can be view on YouTube by typing in Suzanne Collins Borders Interview. There are 5 parts to the interview.  - www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDNJd192Tcw&feature=related Border's Book Club with Suzanne Collins While flipping between reality shows and footage of the Iraq war, Suzanne got this idea for The Hunger Games. She used to be obsessed with the gladiator games and greek mythology as a child. She wanted to create a story that combined reality with war.  There is a Scholastic online game that is based on The Hunger Games....Suzanne lost. She thought it was funny that she lost at a game in which she created. After losing, she agreed that she would not have won The Hunger Games if she was really involved in them.  In each of her books, Suzanne answers one dramatic question. When the question is answered, she moves on to the next book. She does this so she doesn't create one book that is 1,500 pages long.

                                Report abuseTranscript of SM 439 Presentationphoto credit Nasa / Goddard Space Flight Center / Reto Stöckli Suzanne Lavelle Baumgartner Jump: What Red Bull Gets Out Of It Summary of the article On Sunday October 14, 2012, Skydiving pro Felix Baumgartner successfully jumped 24 miles to Earth, breaking a world record set more than 50 years ago. Red Bull took full financial responsibility in regards to developing, implementing, and staffing the jump. Relevance Question #1 On what ground could Red Bull base their market segmentation off of? Question #2 How is this sponsorship different from others? Question #3 Does this sponsorship establish any congruency/fit between the sponor and sponsee? Source Rooney, J. (2012, October 15). Baumgartner jump: What red bull gets out of it. Retrieved from http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferrooney/2012/10/15/baumgartner-jump-what-red-bull-gets-out-of-it/print/ Red Bull supports about 600 athletes worldwide: (120 in the U.S.) in 160 different kind of sports and invests about one third of its turnover in marketing. Felix is one of the first Red Bull athletes. Red Bull Stratos is an example of how Red Bull helps its athletes to achieve their professional goals, and the program is one that Red Bull developed together with Felix Baumgartner over the last five years. Red Bull is proud to "sponsor" these types of events because the energy drink company then receives credit for creating the equipment necessary to help these atheltes reach their personal goals , while also delivering valuable physiological and other fields of data to the scientific community. In my opinion, yes. Red Bull has established a strong brand association as being a sponsor of extreme athletes and events, and has a heritage in flying, through its partnerships with aeronautic teams as well as its popular Flying Day events, featuring human-powered vehicles Red Bull was able to demonstrate how to achieve  competitive edge in the beverage industry through the use of sponsorship.Red Bull has positioned themselves  as a product for adventure sports, extreme sports, and outdoor sports. This particular sponsorship reinforced their positioning on a global level.Due to the use of the space jump, Red Bull has been able to establish, and hopefully in the long-term maintain, product differentiation and brand equity. Red Bull  also created a unique positioning opportunity that will in return further create and maintain customer intimacy and loyalty. I also believe that because of these unique sponsorships, Red Bull has created an advantage concerning the area of category exclusivity. Psychographic Personality & Values Benefits sought Product knowledge "Gives You Wings" Energy drink Extremist Trendsetters Athleticism Increase energy Increase performance (cc) image by anemoneprojectors on Flickr In the eyes of Felix Baumgartner, I think he saw Red Bull as more as a partner then "sponsor" status. The organization and Felix worked together for seven years in order to make this jump successful, whereas most sponsorships are not as enduring. Also Red Bull was the backbone behind this event. They are credited with the creation of this event. It wasn't Baumgartner who found Red Bull, it was Red Bull who found Baumgartner. If you go through the chronicles throughout the past years, you will easily be able to identify Red Bull as the being more than just involved in the implemtation and execution of this jump. Finally, if you have watched the jump, the Red Bull logo is identified almost everywhere possible where most sponsorships aren't publisized to such an extent.Full transcriptMore presentations by
