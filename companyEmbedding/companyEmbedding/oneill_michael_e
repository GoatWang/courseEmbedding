 A must have for every devotee of the Blessed Virgin Mary who wishes to honor her under the many titles by which she has been celebrated throughout history in countries around the world. Each day features a sobriquet of Our Lade that derives from a solemnity, feast day, patronage, apparition or miraculous icon related to that date. With sufficient writing space to add your own prayer, reflection or events for that day, you will be able to live each day in the celebration of your own personal Marian Year.
