The Product Quartet – Scott Riegelhaupt-Herzig – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upScott Riegelhaupt-HerzigBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSkilled in Technical Support Management, achieving success through using common sense and working cross-functionally within organizationsNov 27, 2015The Product QuartetThere is a cross-functional symbiosis in successful software companies, the exchange of idea among Product Management, Product Development, Sales, and Support. When working in concert, they can produce beautiful music, i.e. successful products and happy customers.Each has its primary responsibility:Product Management — decide what features are needed to give customers the benefits they requireProduct Development — build the productSales — sell the product and make money for the companySupport — help customers work through issues they encounter with the productNone of this can happen in a vacuum, though. Sales and Support, having the most regular contact with customers, can identify evolving needs and common problems and feed that information back to those specifying and building the software. Product Management and Development teams can let Sales and Support know what’s coming so that they can be prepared to delight customers and help them along. Support can identify common diagnoses they need to make and assist Development in adding tools to improve and accelerate troubleshooting.In short, open channels of communication among this quartet can improve product quality and customer satisfaction…and happy customers keep buying. They also let their friends know when they’re getting good value.Share1Never miss a story from Scott Riegelhaupt-Herzig, when you sign up for Medium.
