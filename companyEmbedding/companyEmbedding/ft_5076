We can however arrange for next day delivery including Saturday in most cases.3. How is My Purchased Warrantied?AValive supports all the products we sell. We have been in business since 1994 and have relationships with all the major vendors and distributors in the Pro AV industry . If you have need warranty assistance email us at rma@avalive.com4. What is your return policy-Terms and Conditions ?AValive like many retailers are being forced with open box restocking fees from the manufactures we represent. Therefore we reserve the right to charge 33% in restocking fees and no refund of shipping charges Not All Products qualify for returns including special orders and items any manufacture refuses to take in return. Software can not be returned for any reason nor warranties and training materials.

6. AValive/Triangle Visual Interactive makes every effort to ensure that the information on this web site, including but not limited to product pricing, availability, and details, is complete and accurate. However, due to rapidly changing conditions with our suppliers, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information contained herein. AValive/Triangle Visual Interactive reserves the right to modify or change any information without prior notice to you, as well as limit the quantity of any product purchased. In the event that an order is placed and information about any item in the order is incorrect, AValive/Triangle Visual Interactive will notify you about the inaccuracy, and will only process the order pending your approval. However, we also reserve the right to refuse or cancel the order at our discretion. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.5. What Time Is Shipping Cut Off ?Most orders placed before 3PM EST can be shipped expedited same day using Fed Ex or UPS Express Services. If the product is shipped out of our west coast distribution warehouses. We can often execute the order as late as 4 pm EST. Please note we make every effort to ship ASAP on all orders but certain manufactures require a 1-2 day lead time. 6. When Do You Charge My Card ?AValive never charges your card until we confirm the product you ordered is shippable or pre-ordered and all costs have been communicated to you. So if you get a message saying shipping not calculated you can be assured that someone from AValive will either email or call you with an exact total before we process your order. 7. When I place my order is my card automatically charged ?No: AValive processes each order manually to guarantee accuracy and availability . Your card is never charged by an automated cart system.8. Who Pays Customs Charges and Tarrifs if I Am An International Order ?
It is very important to consider the effects of tariffs, taxes, port handling fees and other miscellaneous customs charges when determining your product's final cost. Depending on your product and country of destination, customs charges will affect the price you the buyer is willing to pay for your product. The importer (buyer) is responsible for paying these charges and Avalive will not be responsible for this .9. Who Warranties My Product Purchase ?Please contact the manufacture if the item you receive is defective. The item needs to be returned directly to the manufacture NOT AValive. Simply call the manufacture with your serial # and follow their steps in the warranty process. AValive is not responsible for items shipped to us with out an AValive RMA # and shipping such to us may result in you never seeing the product again.10. Why does the product price say 'Click for best price'?Often times manufacturers do not want any price other than MAP or Minimum Advertised Price to be listed in any form of e-commerce or advertising. Because AValive believes in the American Way we feel we should determine what price you pay not someone else.
AValive has the legal right to set our own prices independently, but some manufacturers place restrictions on how those prices may be displayed. Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer's "minimum advertised price," the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you take further action, such as placing the item in your shopping cart, or in some cases, proceeding to the final checkout stage or emailing. The steps required depend on the details of the manufacturer's minimum advertised price policy.
AValive won't require you to purchase the product. You can easily remove it from your cart if you decide not to buy it and no further information is kept.
11. Will I Pay Sales Tax ?All orders shipped to NC will be charged NC Sales Tax unless you are a reseller which will require a NC Dept Of Revenue Exemption Form to be faxed to us. Almost all other states we ship to will not be charged sales tax with the only exception being some direct ship from warehouses located in the state to which the product s shipped to.

This is a perfect spiral topiary! Bought two of these beauties for our formal living room mantel. I have an Ethan Allen french mantel mirror in-between the two topiaries. Yes, the topiaries need a little "fluffing" of the greenery once they arrive, but once they are "fluffed" (this only took me about 10 mins for both trees) and the stems of greenery are adequately filling any open areas, they look fantastic! I did decide to wrap some preserved green moss around the spiral as well for some added beauty (bought the preserved green moss from Walmart for about $2.50 per bag and used 3 small bags total for both topiaries). I did also buy two beautiful decorative tin planters from Jo-Ann's to place these beauties in, and then I topped the planter with some lovely gray Spanish moss. Truly, these topiaries look extremely real in our formal living area...it was exactly the look I was hoping to achieve!~Manuel's wifeRead more

I'm happy with them though. I was told they look sheek. To me they are extremely sleek but my planters probably make them look even skinnier. So make sure you chose your planter size carefully to accommodate these. Oh and I ordered the 3ft ones and have had them outside since July 2015 and they still look the same. They get the occasional cob/spider web but are holding up great!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsLovely topiary treesBySusan Newhallon August 3, 2013Size: 3 ft.|Verified PurchaseI bought 3 of these, put them into decorative black pots and placed them in front of our detached 3 bay garage, in front of each divider between the bays. They moved the appearance of the stone-front garage from attractive to knock-out, IMHO. We'll see how they weather outside in Virginia. Maybe I'll move them inside the garage for the winter.Read more22 comments|

Marineron December 9, 2015Size: 6 ft.|Verified PurchaseI purchased a tree like this from Home Goods as well as Kmart.com a few years ago so I feel like I have a good comparison as to what these should look like.  These are pretty cheap and very skinny.  If it wasn't for the pain in shipping them back I would have returned them.  Sorry.Read more0Comment|
