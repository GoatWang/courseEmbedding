Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
