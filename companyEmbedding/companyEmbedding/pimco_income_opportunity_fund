Ex-Div Reminder For PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund (PKO)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 11/10/14, PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund will trade ex-dividend, for its monthly dividend of $0.19, payable on 12/1/14. As a percentage of PKO's recent stock price of $27.60, this dividend works out to approximately 0.69%, so look for shares of PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund to trade 0.69% lower — all else being equal — when PKO shares open for trading on 11/10/14.
