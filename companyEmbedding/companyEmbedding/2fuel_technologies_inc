Dual Fuel with Torque






















Dual Fuel with Torque



How it Works






What is the "2Fuel System"?
2Fuel is  a patent protected dual fuel system that can be installed on any diesel engine,  and displaces up to 60 percent of the “End of Day” diesel fuel consumption with  either LNG / CNG or Propane. 2Fuel is the only dual fuel technology that retains  the pre-conversion OEM specification for power and torque. 
 2Fuel System  was the first to receive a CARB certification, first to receive an “OEM”  certification from EPA and is  the only Dual Fuel System that was commercialized in Tier 1 OEM production. and  the only company to offer Propane in mobile applications.
This technology is available for both Mobile and Stationary applications. 
2Fuel System Benefits 

            The  2-fuel system employs all the advantages of Natural Gas or Propane while  maintaining the efficient design and reliable power of the Diesel engine.            
 2Fuel is  the only dual fuel technology that continues to blend fuels throughout the  complete high load torque cycle and maintains the OEM torque and HP, the  original MPG, and reduces reliance on foreign energy.          








Fuel Savings
The 2Fuel  system displaces up to 60% of the “End of Day Diesel Fuel Consumption” with  domestically produced clean natural gas or propane. 
By using these alternative  fuels to replace a large portion of the diesel fuel, currently being consumed  in your engines, a tremendous reduction in fuel costs will be realized. 




Lower Emissions
Smog,  acid rain, and carcinogenic particulates are serious environmental issues  today. Commercial vehicles contribute significant  amounts of pollution to the environment by burning diesel fuel. Natural gas and propane powered vehicles have been proven to lower these  emissions by up to 70%. Powering vehicles and stationary engines with natural  gas or propane is an easy step towards, lowering emissions and,  cleaning up the environment for our families.




Energy Independence
Cartel  production control, Middle East conflict, and emerging country demand are  problems that increase oil instability. In recent history oil prices fluctuate  violently with no price stability. What is needed is a lower cost fuel that is  produced domestically. 
The 2Fuel system displaces diesel fuel used in an engine  with clean, domestically produced natural gas and propane. 










How Much Can You Save with 2Fuel?
2Fuel delivers 60% more “End of Day Diesel Fuel Displacement” than any other Dual Fuel System. 
2Fuel is the only Dual Fuel System that continues to blend  fuels, throughout the complete high load cycle, 
        and maintains the  original diesel engine specified OEM Torque and HP. 







Mobile On-Road

A typical tractor trailer averages 5-7 miles per a gallon and 80,000 miles or more a year. That’s more than 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year. 
Fuel Savings Calculator


Mobile Off-road

Excavating  and hauling equipment running 12 hours per day would consume a minimum of 52,000 gallons  of diesel fuel 
        per year.

Stationary Engines

The larger stationary engines running 12 hours per day would consume a minimum of 52,000 gallons  of diesel fuel 
        per year.

Converting Waste Plastic to Ultra-Clean, Ultra-Low Sulphur Fuel
Plastic2Oil® is a clean energy company that recycles waste plastic into liquid fuels. PTO's proprietary Plastic2Oil® technology can deliver economic and environmental benefits by replacing refined fuels and diverting waste plastic from landfills. More









Processor No. 3 Online
Plastic2Oil® successfully brings its third P2O processor online at the Company's Niagara Falls, NY facility. More

The P2O Advantage
With its revolutionary Plastic2Oil (P2O) technology, Plastic2Oil Inc. has pioneered the development of a process that derives ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel, directly from unwashed, unsorted waste plastics.More

Bordynuik ASME Paper
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers publishes a paper by John Bordynuik on the viability of diesel production with P2O. More



Global Vision ... Local Impact
In the mid-1990s, when the founder of Plastic2Oil® was working at the Ontario Legislature he began to notice a trend: an increase in plastic waste resulting from growing plastic generation ... without recycling. Thinking forward, as he so often does, he saw the seed of an enormous problem looming.
In the ensuing 15 years, the problem he foresaw has manifested. Because of the new "disposable mentality" that came with plastic containers, we now are navigating the fallout of an enormous waste plastic problem, on a global scale. It's complex, it's far-reaching and it's intimately tied to politics and economics.The nugget of the problem that he had been thinking about all these years was what to do with the plastic waste we now generate – in the US alone, over 31 million tons a year are generated with only approximately 8% being recycled (2010).Over the years, there have been various solutions proposed – diversion, burning, etc.; however, nothing to date has proven to be a truly effective or environmentally responsible solution to the burgeoning global landfill problem. In fact, many existing solutions have been just the opposite: costly, energy inefficient or equally as harmful to the environment as the plastic itself. It's only now, with the Plastic2Oil technology, that there is a solution that is not only economically viable, but that is remarkably simple and "green" as well.

 Our Technology
Natural gas is a clean, readily available fuel. That’s why Engine Control Technology (ECT) developed the 2-FUEL system for the diesel engine market. With the 2-FUEL system, natural gas is injected into the engine, where it is combined with a small diesel pilot for combustion. By displacing the expensive diesel fuel with natural gas the customer will reap many benefits.
