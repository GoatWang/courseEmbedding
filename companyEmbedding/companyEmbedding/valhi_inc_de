	VALHI, INC. COMMENTS ON DISTRICT COURT DECISION TO ENJOIN THE SALE OF WASTE CONTROL SPECIALISTS TO ENERGYSOLUTIONS


	DALLAS, TEXAS . . . June 21, 2017 . . . On June 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware issued an order enjoining the sale of Waste Control Specialists (WCS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI), to Energy

	Solutions

	.  Valhi disagrees with the Court's decision, and the parties are evaluating their rights to appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.


	"WCS has built the nation's state-of-the-art facility for low level radioactive waste disposal, and the acquisition will protect desperately needed American jobs and innovation and ensure the continued operation of this facility, which is needed for the disposal of Class B and C low level radioactive waste.  The DOJ investigation and litigation has taken over 18 months at great expense to WCS, and WCS must now determine whether to appeal the trial court's decision and further prolong the process and associated expense," said Rod Baltzer, President and CEO of WCS.


	"WCS presented overwhelming evidence in favor of allowing the transaction to proceed to closing.  We are very disappointed with the decision," said Van Beckwith, the lead trial attorney for WCS and chair of Baker Botts LLP's litigation department.


	Valhi, Inc. is engaged in the titanium dioxide products, component products (security products and recreational marine components), waste management and real estate management and development industries.

Item
1.01.

 

Entry into
a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

As
previously reported, on November 18, 2015, Andrews County Holdings,
Inc. ("ACH"), a subsidiary of the registrant, entered into a
Purchase Agreement (as previously amended and as previously
reported, the "Purchase Agreement") with Rockwell Holdco, Inc.
("Rockwell"), for the sale of Waste Control Specialists LLC
("WCS"), a subsidiary of ACH, to Rockwell.  Rockwell is the
parent company of Energy Solutions , Inc., and Rockwell is
owned by Energy Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on
investing in North America's energy infrastructure. 
   In anticipation of the Antitrust Action (as
hereinafter defined) described in Item 8.01 below, effective
November 14, 2016, ACH and Rockwell entered into a Fourth Amendment
to the Purchase Agreement (the "Fourth Amendment").  Terms
used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement, as amended through the
Fourth Amendment.  Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, among
other things:




·



the
deadline for the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement has been extended to July 31, 2017;





·



Rockwell
has agreed to affirmatively contest and resist any Action initiated
by the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice on behalf of the United States (the "DOJ")
challenging under Antitrust Laws the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement ("Antitrust Action");





·



if
judgment in any Antitrust Action is entered in favor of the United
States by a federal district court, or by a federal court of
appeals in the event the federal district court rules against
issuance of the United States' requested preliminary injunction,
then (i) either Party shall be entitled to immediately terminate
the Purchase Agreement under specified terms and conditions, and
(ii) the registrant agreed to reimburse Rockwell for 50% of
third-party fees and expenses incurred by Rockwell from and after
November 14, 2016 relating to the defense of any Antitrust Action
which may be initiated (including any appeal), subject to a
specified maximum reimbursement of $6.0 million plus 50% of such
fees and expenses associated with any such appeal in excess of such
$6.0 million cap;





·



in the
event an Antitrust Action is not initiated, or in the event an
Antitrust Action is initiated but is subsequently settled,
dismissed or otherwise resolved in accordance with the terms of the
Purchase Agreement and in a manner that permits the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement to proceed to a Closing, the
parties shall continue to honor their obligations under the
Purchase Agreement in order to effect a Closing as promptly as
practical after notification by the government that no such
Antitrust Action will be initiated (or as promptly as practical
after any such settlement, dismissal or resolution);





·



in the
event any Antitrust Action is initiated, then the Aggregate
Consideration shall consist solely of the Base Cash Purchase Price
and the Series A Shares shall not be included as part of the
Aggregate Consideration ;





·



the
Parties agreed to execute a general mutual release containing
specified terms and conditions, ACH waived, and agreed it would not
assert, raise or make, any claim under the Purchase Agreement or
otherwise based upon Rockwell's defense of any Antitrust Action,
and the Parties waived, and agreed they would not assert, raise or
make, any claim previously asserted, or which could have been
asserted, in the Lawsuit or the Arbitration described in the Venue
Agreement; and




  

 

 




·



Rockwell
agreed to deposit $10 million cash within 5 Business Days after
November 14, 2016 in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") with
an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to the parties.  In the
event a Closing occurs under the Purchase Agreement, the Escrow
Amount will be released to Rockwell.  In the event of a
permitted termination of the Purchase Agreement (including pursuant
to the terms of the Fourth Amendment), the Escrow Amount shall be
released to WCS (and receipt of such Escrow Amount following such
permitted termination of the Purchase Agreement would replace, and
Rockwell would not be obligated to pay to ACH, the $35 million
Termination Fee provided for in the Purchase Agreement), the
Parties will execute a general mutual release containing specified
terms and conditions, and ACH and its Affiliates agreed not to make
any Claim for, any matter under, related to or arising out of, the
Purchase Agreement and related agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby.  Rockwell continues to be obligated to
pay to ACH the $35 million Termination Fee provided for in the
Purchase Agreement only in the event that all conditions to Close
under the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied (including receipt
of U.S. anti-trust approval), but such Closing does not occur due
to a breach by Rockwell of its obligations under the Purchase
Agreement.




 

All other
terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement remain
unchanged.  A copy of the Fourth Amendment is attached as
Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by
reference.  The foregoing description of the Fourth Amendment
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Fourth Amendment.

 

   

Item
8.01.

 

Other
Events.

 

On
November 16, 2016, the DOJ filed an Antitrust Action in the U.S.
federal district court for the District of Delaware styled United
States of America vs. Energy Solutions, Inc., et al (Case No.
1:16-cv-01056-UNA) seeking an injunction to enjoin completion of
the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. 
Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, Rockwell and its affiliates are
required, with the cooperation and assistance of ACH and its
affiliates, to vigorously contest and resist such Antitrust Action.
There can be no assurance that the Parties will be successful in
contesting and resisting such Antitrust Action, that receipt of
U.S. anti-trust approval will be obtained or that any sale of WCS
will be completed.

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

The
statements in this Current Report relating to matters that are not
historical facts are forward-looking statements that represent
management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available
information.  Although the registrant believes the
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, it cannot give any assurances that these expectations
will be correct.  Such statements by their nature involve
substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact
expected results, and actual future results could differ materially
from those predicted.  While it is not possible to identify
all factors, the registrant continues to face many risks and
uncertainties.  Among the factors that could cause our actual
future results to differ materially include, but are not limited
to, the following:

 





 



•



Future
supply and demand for our products;






 



•



The extent
of the dependence of certain of our businesses on certain market
sectors;






 



•



The
cyclicality of certain of our businesses (such as Kronos' titanium
dioxide pigment ("TiO 2 ") operations);






 



•



Customer
and producer inventory levels;




  

 

 




 



•



Unexpected
or earlier-than-expected industry capacity expansion (such as the
TiO 2 industry);






 



•



Changes in
raw material and other operating costs (such as energy, ore, zinc,
brass and steel costs) and our ability to pass those costs on to
our customers or offset them with reductions in other operating
costs;






 



•



Changes in
the availability of raw materials (such as ore);






 



•



General
global economic and political conditions (such as changes in the
level of gross domestic product in various regions of the world and
the impact of such changes on demand for, among other things, TiO2
and component products);






 



•



Competitive
products and prices and substitute products, including increased
competition from low-cost manufacturing sources (such as
China);






 



•



Possible
disruption of our business or increases in the cost of doing
business resulting from terrorist activities or global
conflicts;






 



•



Customer
and competitor strategies;






 



•



Potential
difficulties in integrating future acquisitions;






 



•



Potential
difficulties in upgrading or implementing new manufacturing and
accounting software systems;






 



•



Potential
consolidation of our competitors;






 



•



Potential
consolidation of our customers;






 



•



The impact
of pricing and production decisions;






 



•



Competitive
technology positions;






 



•



The
introduction of trade barriers;






 



•



The
ability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends;






 



•



The impact
of current or future government regulations (including employee
healthcare benefit related regulations);






 



•



Uncertainties
associated with new product development and the development of new
product features;






 



•



Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates (such as changes in the exchange rate
between the U.S. dollar and each of the euro, the Norwegian krone,
and the Canadian dollar) or possible disruptions to our business
resulting from potential instability resulting from uncertainties
associated with the euro;






 



•



Operating
interruptions (including, but not limited to, labor disputes,
leaks, natural disasters, fires, explosions, unscheduled or
unplanned downtime and transportation interruptions);






 



•



Decisions
to sell assets other than in the ordinary course of
business;






 



•



The timing
and amounts of insurance recoveries;






 



•



Our
ability to renew, amend, refinance or establish credit
facilities;






 



•



Our
ability to maintain sufficient liquidity;






 



•



The
ultimate outcome of income tax audits, tax settlement initiatives
or other tax matters;






 



•



Our
ultimate ability to utilize income tax attributes or changes in
income tax rates related to such attributes, the benefits of which
may not presently have been recognized under the
more-likely-than-not recognition criteria (such as Kronos' ability
to utilize its German and Belgium net operating loss
carryforwards);






 



•



Environmental
matters (such as those requiring compliance with emission and
discharge standards for existing and new facilities, or new
developments regarding environmental remediation at sites related
to our former operations);






 



•



Government
laws and regulations and possible changes therein (such as changes
in government regulations which might impose various obligations on
former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead-based paint,
including NL, with respect to asserted health concerns associated
with the use of such products);




  

 

 




 



•



The
ultimate resolution of pending litigation (such as NL's lead
pigment litigation, environmental and other litigation and Kronos'
class action litigation);






 



•



Our
ability to comply with covenants contained in our revolving bank
credit facilities;






 



•



Our
ability to complete
