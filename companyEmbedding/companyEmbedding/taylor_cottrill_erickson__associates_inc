Our History & Approach
Independent, Fee-Only Registered Investment Advisor
Taylor, Cottrill, Erickson & Associates, Inc. is a registered investment advisory firm offering fee‐based wealth and portfolio management services to individuals and institutions. The firm was formed on 12/31/2015 by the merger of Whitegate Investment Counselors, Inc. (founded 1992) and Taylor, Cottrill LLC (founded 2007). Wholly-owned by employees, the firm’s primary goal is to provide clients with financial peace of mind in a cost-effective, conflict-free environment.
 
Investment Approach
In a world where asset prices are buffeted by news from across the world and where prices can overreact to even minor corporate announcements, how does an investor make decisions regarding asset allocation and securities selection? Doing nothing can be harmful and reacting emotionally can be even worse. Our guidelines are these:

Diversification is the best tool for managing volatility when seeking returns that require risk-taking. There are rules of thumb, but the appropriate level of diversification is unique to each client’s specific situation.
Asset Allocation is the primary determinant of investment returns. The choice between stocks or bonds is more important than the choice between which stocks, or which bonds.
Execution is critical. Consistent execution of an investment strategy with consideration of easily measured costs (such as investment management fees) as well as less obvious costs, such as taxes, commissions, and trading spreads, adds value over time.
Confidence in your advisor during difficult markets will help weather the storm and prevent the very common and very costly mistake of making drastic changes at precisely the wrong moment.

For many clients we recommend a portfolio constructed of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Periodic rebalancing of these portfolios allows us to manage cash flow needs and to take advantage of market volatility. For other clients we recommend a portfolio constructed of high quality individual stocks and bonds selected to best meet their needs for diversification, liquidity, and income. For stock selection, we utilize a value and quality-based methodology that we have refined over the past 30 years. We incorporate the latest data on key variables including interest rates, corporate cash flows, profitability measures and projected growth rates, allowing us to calculate a “fair value” for a wide range of securities. There is no advantage to the firm in using one approach or the other, or some combination of the two.

Our Clients
Our clients vary greatly in many measures. We serve younger investors who have accumulated wealth as well as older clients approaching or in retirement. We also serve a few institutions. Some clients have more than they will ever need, others are striving to build or maintain their nest egg. Some have never owned stocks, others have never owned bonds. However:

Most of our clients have a goal of seeing their assets grow without taking undue risk.
Most of our clients have been referred to us by an existing client or by a trusted accountant or attorney.
Most of our clients have the ability to manage their own investments (or to learn to do so), but recognize they have neither the time nor the interest this endeavor requires in the rapidly-changing world of today.

Our goal is to develop long-term relationships that are cost-effective for our clients and profitable for our business. The average client relationship encompasses liquid assets of $3 million, with individual accounts ranging in size from $100,000 to over $75 million. Under most circumstances, a minimum annual fee of $5,000 is needed to take full advantage of the portfolio management services we offer. As the value of your portfolio approaches $2,000,000, a wider range of wealth services is often introduced into a relationship.
Your Initial Meeting & Beyond
In your initial conversation with us, either on the phone or in person, we welcome the opportunity to get to know you better and learn how we may serve you. We will discuss your financial goals and listen to your concerns. We will review your current investment and retirement statements, and we will explain our approach to investing. If you retain our firm, we will establish a customized asset allocation that suits your personal situation and risk tolerance level. Your account will be placed with a third-party custodian, which will independently provide notice of trades, monthly statements, and year-end tax reports. We will provide regular written updates on your portfolio and our strategies, and we encourage conversation any time you have a question about your investments. If logistics permit, we thoroughly enjoy an annual client meeting and always look forward to getting updated on your financial situation. If you’d like to begin this process, please use the contact information (right) and ask for Jennifer Goin.
