TCP Announces Resignation of K.R. "Kaj" den Daas as CEO and Appointment of Brian Catlett as Interim CEO; Provides Update on Audit Committee Investigation


AURORA, Ohio, Aug. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TCP International Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: TCPI), a leading global manufacturer and distributor of energy efficient lighting technologies, today announced that Chief Executive Officer K.R. "Kaj" den Daas has resigned for personal reasons, effective October 3, 2016.

The Board of Directors named Brian Catlett, currently Chief Financial Officer, as interim CEO and Zachary Guzy, currently the Company's Global Corporate Controller, as interim CFO, as of October 3. The Board will engage a national search firm to identify qualified candidates for the CEO position.
"We appreciate the stable leadership Kaj has provided during his tenure with TCP and thank him for his many efforts in building and maintaining our business and vendor and customer relationships during a particularly challenging time for the Company," said Lead Director Ralph Della Ratta Jr. "We believe that Kaj's efforts have been instrumental in positioning us for future growth."
Mr. den Daas, a Dutch native who came out of retirement to become CEO on June 30, 2015, informed the Board that he intends to return to Europe to be closer to his family in the Netherlands. His resignation is unrelated to the Audit Committee investigation underway since late last year.
"I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with the talented and hardworking team at TCP, and I am proud of where we have positioned the Company in the marketplace," said Mr. den Daas. "However, I feel that stepping down at this time is something that I must do for my family."
Mr. Catlett has served as Chief Financial Officer since January 2014 after serving as Senior Vice President of Global Finance since 2012. He has served in various executive capacities for over 25 years, including chief financial officer and managing partner of a private equity fund. From 2004 until 2012, Mr. Catlett was a partner in Consumer Innovation Partners, a consumer products private equity fund. He holds a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Iowa.
Mr. Guzy, who has served as Global Corporate Controller since June 2012, is responsible for directing the Company's global accounting activities, including SEC reporting and the relationship with external auditors. He holds a bachelor's degree in Accountancy from Miami University and is a certified public accountant.
Separately, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors stated that it is in the process of obtaining what it believes are the last pieces of information from banks in China and Hong Kong necessary to allow it to complete its investigation into certain payments made by the Company's Chairman, Ellis Yan, and into potential related party transactions involving Ellis Yan and the Company's Vice Chairman, Solomon Yan. Pending the review of this information, the Audit Committee anticipates completing its investigation by the end of September 2016.
Based upon the investigative procedures to date, the Company has not identified any material adjustments to its financial results. However, the investigation is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that material adjustments to previously issued financial statements will not be required.  The Company is taking the actions necessary to enable it to complete its financial statements and prepare its delinquent reports as soon as practical once it has obtained the necessary information to issue its financial statements.  
At present, the Company is unable to state when it will be in a position to issue its financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended March 31, 2016, or the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.  It is also is unable to state when it will be able to regain compliance with its SEC reporting obligations.  TCP's common shares may be subject to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange if it does not regain compliance with its obligations by September 30, 2016.  The Company does not believe that it will be able to regain compliance by that date, and intends to request a further extension from the New York Stock Exchange.  Under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the date 
by which the Company would have to be compliant with its reporting obligations could be extended until no later than November 24, 2016.

Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this release may constitute "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on management's current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results. Forward looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, the Company's expectations regarding its future profitability, its ongoing Audit Committee investigation and its ability to comply with SEC reporting obligations and New York Stock Exchange listing requirements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ 
materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While TCP believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release. TCP expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in its expectations with regard thereto or changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The 1000Bulbs.com Difference

The quality you need. We carry lighting products by Sylvania, GE Lighting, Philips Lighting, and many more trusted manufacturers.
The affordable prices you want. Our extremely low prices reflect our number one goal: Making quality lighting affordable to everyone!
A huge selection and helpful application information. We have thousands of lights and lighting accessories to fit your specific needs.
Lighting that saves you money. Our energy-saving compact fluorescents and LED bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.

				Wednesday, 25 June 2014 03:50 (EST)









TCP International Holdings Ltd. ($TCPI) believes that the market for LED lighting solutions is at an inflection point that will drive increased adoption. It is headquartered in Cham, Switzerland,

	Fourteen other companies are scheduled for the week of June 23, 2014. The complete IPO calendar is available at IPOpremium.

	The manager and co-managers are Deutsche Bank Securities and Piper Jaffray. The joint managers are Canaccord Genuity and Cowen and Company.

TCPI scheduled a $100 million IPO with a market capitalization of $440 million at a price range midpoint of $14 for Thursday, June 26, 2014 on the Nasdaq.  SEC filings

	TCP International Holdings Ltd. IPO Report

Overview

	TCPI believes that the market for LED lighting solutions is at an inflection point that will drive increased adoption.

	However, it's not necessarily growing the market, it appears to be cannabilizing the compact fluorescent lamplighting (CFL) market from itself.

	Top line revenue grew 19% for 2013 vs 2012. The rate of growth slowed to 12% for Q1 '14 vs Q1 '13.

	There was a $4 million foreign exchange swing in TPCI's favor for Q1 '14 vs Q1 '13, resulting in a 3.9% Q1 '14 profit vs a 1% Q1 '13 profit.

	It's difficult to feel comfortable with income projections when a company has major foreign exchange gains (losses) swings.

	TCPI bills itself as a technology company but the gross margin is only 25%. True technology companies have higher gross margins.

	TCPI has established the largest number of Energy Star® compliant lighting products for LEDs and CFLs combined.

Product mix

	For the last several years CFL lamp sales have represented the majority of overall sales mix, comprising 81.7%, 72.6% and 67.5% of 2011, 2012 and 2013 net sales, respectively and 58.8% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014.

	The decline in CFL sales as a percentage of net sales principally is the result of the successful introduction and expansion of new LED products, which grew from 4.3% of net sales in 2011 to 15.7% of net sales in 2012, to 25% of net sales in 2013 and to 35.9% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014.

Internally developed technology

	TCPI’s internally developed driver, optical system, thermal management, and power management technologies deliver a high standard of efficiency and light quality.

	TCPI’s broad portfolio of advanced LED and CFL lamps and fixtures enables it to address a wide range of applications required by its retail and commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.

	The lighting market is characterized by rapid product innovation and, as a result, TCPI has maintained integrated product design and manufacturing capabilities to allow TCPI to quickly respond to the rapidly evolving demands of its customers.

	TCPI’s products are currently offered through thousands of retail and C&I distributors.

	Since its inception in 1993, TCPI has sold more than one billion energy efficient lighting products.

General lighting market

	The general lighting market is in a state of transition from inefficient lighting technologies, primarily incandescent lamps, to efficient lighting technologies, primarily LEDs and CFLs.

	This transition is driven by improving light quality, appealing economics, government regulations, public awareness, and emerging connectivity and control capabilities.

	According to McKinsey, the global LED and CFL markets are expected to grow from $22.1 billion in 2011 to $87.4 billion in 2020 in aggregate, representing a CAGR of 16.5%.

LED lighting market

	TCPI believes that the market for LED lighting solutions is at an inflection point that will drive increased adoption.

Distribution channels

	Currently, TCPI sells the majority of its products in the United States and Canada, accounting for 82.4% of its net sales in 2013.

	Key customers in the retail channel include The Home Depot, to which TCPI ise one of the largest energy efficient lamp suppliers in the United States; Walmart, from whom TCPI received a Supplier Award of Excellence in 2013, and Carrefour.

	Key customers in the Commercial & Industrial (C&I) channel include HD Supply, Regency, Rexel, CED, and Grainger.

	TCPI’s net sales in the United States and Canada are principally made through its retail channel, most notably through The Home Depot  (HD)  and Walmart  (WMT) , as well as through various C&I distributors.

International

	In addition, TCPI has significant sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure outside of the United States and Canada, especially in EMEA, Asia and Latin America, which represented 7.7%, 5.1% and 4.9%, respectively, of its net sales in 2013.

	In the first half of 2014, TCPI opened its newest sales offices in Japan and Germany.

	TCPI’s largest Asian customers include IRIS, a C&I distributor in Japan, and Emart, a retailer in South Korea.

	In 2012, TCPI acquired its distributors in Europe and Latin America. TCPI believes that these acquisitions have provided us with the ability to expand in markets that are transitioning to energy efficient lighting.

Dividend Policy

	No dividends are planned.

Intellectual Property

	TCPI owns 21 issued U.S. patents and 19 pending U.S. patent applications.

	TCPI’s U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2016 and 2032.

Competition

	As a result of its broad product portfolio, TCPI faces global competition from a variety of well-established and emerging lighting companies.

	TCPI believes that its competitors mainly operate under two distinct business models, with some manufacturing lamps in-house and others purchasing lamps through joint ventures or from original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, for resale under their own brand.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $
(or $         if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional 
shares in full), at an assumed public offering price of $         per common 
share, the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, 
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to expand and improve our 
manufacturing processes, for research, development and commercialization 
activities in LED and other emerging technologies, for debt reduction, and for 
working capital and other general corporate purposes. The debt reduction would 
result from repayment of certain short-term indebtedness, which was incurred by
our China subsidiaries to expand capacity and for general working capital 
purposes, in the amount of $                , as well as repayment of a portion
of TCP US’s credit facility, which was incurred for general working capital 
purposes, in the amount of $                . The weighted average interest 
rate on China short-term indebtedness during 2011 was 6.2%. At December 31, 
2011, TCP US’s credit facility had interest rates of 2.8% for LIBOR rate loans 
and 4.8% for prime rate loans. Effective January 1, 2012, the interest rates 
for TCP US’s credit facility increased to LIBOR plus 3.0% for LIBOR rate loans 
(previously LIBOR plus 2.5%) and the bank’s prime rate plus 2.0% for prime rate
loans (previously the bank’s prime rate plus 1.5%). TCP US’s credit facility 
matures on December 11, 2013. 

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, 
or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have
no current agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or 
acquisition, and we are not currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 
any investment or acquisition. 

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed public offering price of $     
per common share would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to
us by approximately $        , assuming the number of common shares offered by 
us as set forth on the cover of this prospectus remains the same and after 
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us.


The electric light bulb market is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving 
market. As a result of our broad product portfolio, we face global competition 
from a variety of well-established and emerging lighting companies. We believe 
that our competitors mainly operate under two distinct business models, with 
some manufacturing bulbs in-house and others purchasing bulbs through joint 
ventures or from original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, for resale under 
their own brand. We compete with companies that employ both of these models, 
including traditional lighting manufacturers and distributors that source and 
sell finished products. We believe that the key competitive factors in the 
electric light bulb market include: 

 o portfolio of products and product quality; 
 
 o price and cost competitiveness; 
 
 o access to distribution channels globally; 
 
 o customer orientation and strong customer relationships; and 
 
 o product development and speed to market. 
 
We compete against a different set of companies in each of the technologies 
that we produce. In the CFL market, our primary competitors include Feit 
Electric, General Electric, Megaman, Philips, Sylvania and Westinghouse 
Lighting, in addition to several smaller CFL manufacturers. In our LED product 
line, we primarily compete with Cree, General Electric, LG Electronics, 
Lighting Science Group, MSi, Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Sylvania, and several 
smaller LED bulb providers, many of which are new entrants in the market in the
last few years. In the fixture market, we mainly compete with Acuity Brands, 
Cooper Industries, Havells India, Howard Power Solutions, Hubbell and Philips. 

Some of our competitors are larger than we are with greater resources to devote
to R&D, manufacturing and marketing, as well as greater brand name recognition 
and channel access. Some of our more diversified competitors can also compete 
more aggressively with us by subsidizing losses in their LED lighting 
businesses with profits from other lines of business. Moreover, if one or more 
of our competitors or suppliers were to merge or otherwise consolidate with one
another, the change in the competitive landscape could materially and adversely
affect our customer, channel or supplier relationships, and, as a result, our 
competitive position. In addition, any loss of a key channel partner, whether 
to a competitor or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our 
competitive position. 

We primarily compete based on the numerous benefits of CFL and LED lighting and
our strategy of offering a complete product portfolio that provides access to 
all emerging energy efficient socket-based lamp technology alternatives. We 
believe our breadth of product offerings provides us with flexibility 
regardless of which lighting technology becomes most accepted. We believe we 
also outperform our competitors in energy efficient lighting products with our 
customer service and operational (supply) performance. Our channel 
relationships, technology and understanding of the industry enable us to 
compete favorably against our competitors.


Company Description
We are a leading producer and provider of energy efficient light bulbs to the 
global structures light bulb market. Our primary products include socket-based 
compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and halogen
bulbs. We were the number one provider of CFLs in the United


 States in 2011, 
with a 31% market share, according to the National Equipment Manufacturers 
Association, or NEMA. We have a strong distribution footprint and reputation 
among retailers and commercial lighting distributors and sell our products 
through more than 20,000 retail and commercial & industrial, or C&I, outlets. 
Since we manufacture only energy efficient light bulbs, and not conventional 
incandescent bulbs, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the
phase out of inefficient bulbs taking place in many major markets around the 
world. 

With more than 3,500 CFL stock-keeping units, or SKUs, we believe that we have 
the largest and one of the most technologically advanced CFL product offerings 
in the world. We also sell a product line of more than 275 LED SKUs and 12 
halogen SKUs that address a majority of socket-based lighting applications. 
Since our inception, we have focused on product innovation and research and 
development, or R&D. We have approximately 50 engineers and technicians focused
on delivering new products to market and improving our existing products. We 
have developed several award winning products, including our private label 
CFLs, that achieved the highest overall rating from Consumer Reports for a CFL 
product from 2008 through 2011. We have also developed award winning LED bulbs,
including our PAR38 and PAR30 series LED bulbs, which were both ranked #1 out 
of 67 and 49 entries, respectively, in a recent study performed by the 
Institute for Electric Efficiency, in which they were compared to products from
Lighting Science Group, Philips, Samsung and Sylvania, among others. As the 
global lighting market reduces its reliance on conventional incandescent light 
bulbs, we believe that our broad portfolio of energy efficient lighting 
products creates a technology-neutral platform for growth, enabling us to 
address the majority of global socket-based lighting applications regardless 
of which technologies gain market acceptance. 

We currently sell our products to a diverse global customer base through our 
two primary channels: the retail channel and the C&I channel. We also sell our 
products to retailers through utility and government incentive programs. Our 
key customers in the retail channel include The Home Depot, to which we are the
largest energy efficient bulb supplier in the United States, as well as 
Homebase and Wal-Mart, which primarily sell our products under private label. 
Our key customers in the C&I segment include Consolidated Electrical 
Distributors, or CED, Grainger, HD Supply, Regency and Rexel. We have also 
established a presence in Asia, Europe and South America, and seek to leverage 
our strong North American customer and distribution base to facilitate 
expansion in these attractive global markets. 

We utilize a vertically integrated, efficient and highly automated process to 
manufacture our CFL products. For our LED bulbs, we develop our own design 
specifications and source components from world class suppliers, and then we 
assemble and test the LED bulbs in-house. We have four manufacturing facilities
located in China, where we have developed and currently utilize several 
advanced manufacturing techniques that we believe are proprietary. We currently
outsource production of halogen bulbs, however, we plan to bring this 
production in-house as demand for these products grows. Unlike many of our 
competitors that outsource much or all of their product manufacturing, we 
believe our vertically integrated manufacturing processes enable us to control 
substantially all phases of our product manufacturing and distribution, 
allowing us to achieve best-in-class product quality, minimize our costs, react
faster to our customers’ design requirements and provide shorter lead times for
new products than our competitors.
