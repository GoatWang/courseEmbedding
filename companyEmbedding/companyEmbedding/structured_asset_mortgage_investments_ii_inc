(1)   The Certificate Sizes are
approximate and subject to a 10% variance.
 
(2)   The Offered Certificates will be
rated by Standard & Poor's ("S&P") and
     Moody's
Investors Service ("Moody's").
 
(3)   The Credit Enhancement percentages
are preliminary and are subject to
     change based
upon the final pool as of the Cut-off Date and additional
     rating agency
analysis.
 
(4)   The Class 1-A-1 Certificates will
bear interest bear interest at a variable
     rate (the
Pass-Through Rate) equal to the weighted average net rate of
the
     Group 1 mortgage
loans. The Pass-Through Rate with respect to the first
     Interest Accrual
Period is expected to be approximately 4.266%. The Class
     1-A-1
Certificates will settle with accrued interest on a 30/360 basis
(24
     day delay). The
certificate balances of the Class 1-A-1 Certificates are
     subject to
increases due to the negative amortization feature of the
     mortgage loans
in Group 1 as described herein.
 
(5)   The Pass-Through Rate for the
Class 1-A-2 Certificates (together with the
     Class 1-A-1
Certificates, the "Class 1-A Certificates") will be a floating
     rate based on
One-Month LIBOR plus 0.380% subject to the lesser of (i) Net
     Rate Cap (equal
to the weighted average Net Rate of the Group 1 Mortgage
     Loans) and (ii)
10.50%. On the first distribution date after the Clean-Up
     Call Date, such
class's margin will be multiplied by 2.0 times the original
     certificate
margin. The Class 1-A-2 Certificates will settle flat and
     accrue interest
on an Actual/360 basis. The Class 1-A-2 Certificates are
     subject to
increases in their certificate principal balances as a result
of
     the negative
amortization feature of the mortgage loans.
 
(6)   The Class 1-X-1 Certificates will
bear interest at a variable pass-through
     rate equal to
the greater of (i) zero and (ii) the excess of (x) the
     weighted average
of the net rates of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans over (y)
     the weighted
average pass-through rate on the Class 1-A-2 Certificates
     based on the
notional amount equal to aggregate current principal amount of
     the Class 1-A-2
Certificates. The Class 1-X-1 will settle with accrued
     interest and
accrue interest on a 30/360 basis (24 day delay).
 
(7)   The Class 1-M-X Certificates will
bear interest at a variable pass-through
     rate equal to
the greater of (i) zero and (ii) the excess of (x) the
     weighted average
of the net rates of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans over (y)
     the weighted
average pass-through rate on the Class 1-B Certificates based
     on the notional
amount equal to current principal amount of the Class 1-B
     Certificates. .
The Class M-X will settle with accrued interest and accrue
     interest on a
30/360 basis (24 day delay).
 
(8)   The Pass-Through Rate for the
Class 1-B-1, Class 1-B-2, Class 1-B-3, Class
     1-B-4 , Class
1-B-5, Class 1-B-6 and Class 1-B-7 Certificates
     (collectively,
the "Class 1-B Certificates") will be a floating rate based
     on One-Month
LIBOR plus 0.650%, 0.700%, 1.250%, 1.500%, 1.500%, 1.500% and
     1.500%,
respectively, subject to the lesser of (i) Net Rate Cap (equal
to
     the weighted
average Net Rate of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans) and (ii)
     10.50%. On the
first distribution date after the Clean-Up Call Date, each
     such class'
margin will be multiplied by 1.5 times the original certificate
     margin. The
Class 1-B Certificates will settle flat and accrue interest on
     an Actual/360
basis. The Class 1-B Certificates are subject to increases in
     their
certificate principal balances as a result of the negative
     amortization
feature of the mortgage loans.

COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION:         
On November 1, 2005, the aggregate principal
                               
balance of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans
      
                         
described herein is expected to be
                               
approximately $390.8 million.
 
                               
The Group 1 Mortgage Loans are indexed to the
                               
LIBOR Annual Monthly Average ("LAMA") which
                               
equates to the 12-month average of 1-month
                               
LIBOR. ( In order to view historical LAMA
                               
type LAMAINDX on Bloomberg.) The Group 1
            
                   
Mortgage Loans have monthly coupon
                               
adjustments that allow for negative
                               
amortization whereby interest payments may be
                               
deferred and added to the principal balance
                               
thereof. For these loans, the monthly payment
                               
amount is subject to adjustment annually on a
                               
date specified in the mortgage note, subject
                                
to the conditions that (i) the amount of the
                               
monthly payment will not increase or decrease
                               
by an amount that is more than 7.50% of the
                           
    
monthly payment prior to the adjustment, (ii)
                               
as of the fifth anniversary of the first due
                               
date and on every fifth year thereafter, the
                               
monthly payment will be recast without regard
                               
to the limitation in clause (i) above and
                               
(iii) if the unpaid principal balance exceeds
                               
a percentage of 110% or 115% of the original
                                
principal balance due to deferred interest,
                               
the monthly payment will be recast without
                               
regard to the limitation in clause (i) to
                               
amortize fully the then unpaid principal
                               
balance of the mortgage loan over its
                               
remaining term to maturity.

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS:         
The Group 1 Mortgage Loans were underwritten
                               
to the guidelines of the Originator as more
                               
fully described in the prospectus supplement.
 
CREDIT ENHANCEMENT:             
Credit Enhancement for the Certificates will

after all of the Offered Certificates have
                               
received their required amounts (see
                               
Cash-Flow Description below).
 
CASH-FLOW DESCRIPTION:          
Distributions on the Certificates will be
                               
made on the 25th day of each month (or next
                               
business day). The payments to the
                               
Certificates, to the extent of available
                               
funds, will be made according to the
                               
following priority:
 
                               
AVAILABLE FUNDS:
 
                               
1.    Payment of
interest to the holders of
                                    
the Class 1-A Certificates and 1-X-1
                                    
Certificates (net of Carryover Shortfall
                                    
Amounts) in an amount equal to their
                                    
respective Pass-Through Rates (as
     
                               
described on the cover page);
 
                               
2.    Payment of
principal to the holders of
                                    
the Class 1-A Certificates in an amount
                                    
equal to its Senior Optimal Principal
                                    
Amount;
 
                               
3.    Payment of
interest to the Class M-X
                                    
Certificates (net of Carryforward
                              
      
Shortfall Amount).
 
                               
4.    Payment of
interest and principal
                                    
sequentially to the Class 1-B
                                    
Certificates so each such Class shall
                
                    
receive (a) interest at each class'
                                    
respective Pass-Through Rate, and (b)
                                    
such class' Allocable Share of the
                                    
Subordinate Optimal Principal
                                    
Distribution Amount.
 
                               
5.    Payment of
any Carryover Shortfall
                                    
Amounts to the Class IA-2 and Class 1- B
                                
    
Certificates.
 
NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION:          
Since the mortgage loans are subject to
                               
negative amortization, the Class 1-A
                               
Certificates and the Subordinate Certificates
                 
              
are subject to increases in their principal
                               
balances. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF NEGATIVE
                               
AMORTIZATION THAT OCCURS IN EACH INTEREST
                               
ACCRUAL PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO EACH MORTGAGE
                               
LOAN SUBGROUP WILL BE OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL
                               
COLLECTIONS FOR SUCH PERIOD ON SUCH RELATED
                               
MORTGAGE LOAN SUBGROUP. Any negative
         
                      
amortization for a related loan subgroup that
                               
is not offset by principal collections will
                               
be accreted pro rata to each class of
                               
Certificates.

SHIFTING INTEREST:              
The Senior Certificates (except for the
                               
Interest Only Certificates) will be entitled
                               
to receive 100% of the prepayments on the
                               
mortgage loans up to and including November
                               
2015. The Senior Prepayment Percentage can be
                                
reduced to the related Senior Percentage plus
                               
70%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0% of the related
                               
Subordinate Percentage over the next five
                               
years provided that (i) the principal balance
                               
of the mortgage loans 60 days or more
                               
delinquent, averaged over the last 6 months,
                               
as a percentage of the Current Principal
                               
Amount of the related Subordinate
                               
Certificates does not exceed 50% and (ii)
                               
cumulative realized losses for the mortgage
                              
  loans do not exceed
30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50%
                               
for each test date.
 
                               
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after 3
                               
years the current Subordinate Percentage is
     
                          
equal to two times the initial Subordinate
                               
Percentage and (i) the principal balance of
                               
the related mortgage loans 60 days or more
                               
delinquent, averaged over the last 6 months,
                               
as a percentage of the Current Principal
                               
Amount of the related Subordinate
                               
Certificates does not exceed 50% and (ii)
                                
cumulative realized losses for the related
                               
mortgage loans do not exceed a) on or prior
                               
to November 2008, 20% or b) after November
                               
2008, 30%, then prepayments will be allocated
                               
on a pro rata basis.
 
                               
If doubling occurs prior to the third
                               
anniversary and the above delinquency and
           
                    
loss tests are met, then 50% of the related
                               
subordinate prepayment percentage can be
                               
allocated to the related subordinate classes.
 
ALLOCATION OF LOSSES:           
Realized Losses on the mortgage loans will be
                               
allocated to the most junior class of
                               
Certificates outstanding beginning with the
                               
Class 1-B-6 Certificates, until the
                                
Certificate Principal Balance of each
                               
Subordinate Class has been reduced to zero.
                               
Thereafter, Realized Losses on the Group 1
                               
Mortgage Loans will be allocated first to the
                               
Class 1-A-2 Certificates until zero and then
                               
to the Class 1-A-1 Certificates.
 
CORRIDOR CAP CONTRACT:          
The issuer will benefit from a series of
                                
interest rate cap payments from the Yield
                               
Maintenance Provider pursuant to two corridor
                               
cap agreements (the "Corridor Cap Agreement")
                          
      purchased
with respect to the Class 1-A-2 and
                               
Class 1-B Certificates. The Corridor Cap
                               
Agreement is intended to partially mitigate
                               
the interest rate risk that could result from
                               
the difference between the Note Interest Rate
                               
on the Class 1-A-2 and Class 1-B Certificates
                               
and the Net Rate Cap with respect to the
                                
mortgage loans.

STATEMENT REGARDING ASSUMPTIONS
         
               
-------------------------------
           
AS TO SECURITIES, PRICING ESTIMATES AND OTHER INFORMATION
           
---------------------------------------------------------
 
The information contained in the attached
materials (the "Information") may
include various forms of performance
analysis, security characteristics and
securities pricing estimates for the
securities addressed. Please read and
understand this entire statement before
utilizing the Information. The
Information is provided solely by Bear
Stearns, not as agent for any issuer, and
although it may be based on data supplied
to it by the issuer, the issuer has
not participated in its preparation and
makes no representations regarding its
accuracy or completeness. Should you
receive Information that refers to the
"Statement Regarding Assumptions and Other
Information", please refer to this
statement instead.
 
The Information is illustrative and is not
intended to predict actual results,
which may differ substantially from those,
reflected in the Information.
Performance analysis is based on certain
assumptions with respect to significant
factors that may prove not to be assumed.
You should understand the assumptions
and evaluate whether they are appropriate
for your purposes. Performance results
are based on mathematical models that use
inputs to calculate results. As with
all models, results may vary significantly
depending upon the value of the
inputs given. Inputs to these models
include but are not limited to: prepayment
expectations (econometric prepayment
models, single expected lifetime
prepayments or a vector of periodic
prepayments), interest rate assumptions
(parallel and nonparallel changes for
different maturity instruments),
collateral assumptions (actual pool level
data, aggregated pool level data,
reported factors or imputed factors),
volatility assumptions (historically
observed or implied current) and reported
information (paydown factors, rate
resets and trustee statements). Models used
in any analysis may be proprietary
making the results difficult for any third
party to reproduce. Contact your
registered representative for detailed
explanations of any modeling techniques
employed in the Information.
 
The Information addresses only certain
aspects of the applicable security's
characteristics and thus does not provide a
complete assessment. As such, the
Information may not reflect the impact of
all structural characteristics of the
security, including call events and cash
flow priorities at all prepayment
speeds and/or interest rates. You should
consider whether the behavior of these
securities should be tested at assumptions
different from those included in the
Information. The assumptions underlying the
Information, including structure and
collateral, may be modified from time to
time to reflect changed circumstances.
Any investment decision should be based
only on the data in the prospectus and
the prospectus supplement or private
placement memorandum (Offering Documents)
and the then current version of the
Information. Offering Documents contain data
that is current as of their publication
dates and after publication may no
longer be complete or current. Contact your
registered representative for
Offering Documents, current Information or
additional materials, including other
models or performance analysis, which are
likely to produce different results,
and any other further explanation regarding
the Information.
 
Any pricing estimates Bear Stearns has
supplied at your request (a) represent
our view, at the time determined, of the
investment value of the securities
between the estimated bid and offer levels,
the spread between which may be
significant due to market volatility or
liquidity, (b) do not constitute a bid
by any person for any security, (c ) may
not constitute prices at which the
securities could have been purchased or
sold in any market, (d) have not been
confirmed by actual trades, may vary from
the value Bear Stearns assigns any
such security while in its inventory, and
may not take into account the size of
a position you have in the security, and
(e) may have been derived from matrix
pricing that uses data relating to other
securities whose prices are more
readily ascertainable to produce a
hypothetical price based on the estimated
yield spread relationship between the
securities.
 
General Information: The data underlying
the Information has been obtained from
sources that we believe are reliable, but
we do not guarantee the accuracy of
the underlying data or computations based
thereon. Bear Stearns and/or
individuals thereof may have positions in
these securities while the Information
is circulating or during such period may
engage in transactions with the issuer
or its affiliates. We act as principal in
transactions with you, and
accordingly, you must determine the
appropriateness for you of such transactions
and address any legal, tax or accounting
considerations applicable to you. Bear
Stearns shall not be a fiduciary or advisor
unless we have agreed in writing to
receive compensation specifically to act in
such capacities. If you are subject
to ERISA, the Information is being
furnished on the condition that it will not
form a primary basis for any investment
decision. The Information is not a
solicitation of any transaction in
securities which may be made only by
prospectus when required by law, in which
event you may obtain such prospectus
from Bear Stearns.

(1) The Certificate Sizes are approximate
and subject to a 10% variance.
 
(2) The Offered Certificates will be rated
by Standard & Poor's ("S&P") and
    Moody's Investors
Service ("Moody's").
 
(3) The Credit Enhancement percentages are
preliminary and are subject to change
    based upon the final
pool as of the Cut-off Date and additional rating
    agency analysis.
 
(4) The Class 1-A-1 Certificates will bear
interest bear interest at a variable
    rate (the Pass-Through
Rate) equal to the weighted average net rate of the
    Group 1 mortgage
loans. The Pass-Through Rate with respect to the first
    Interest Accrual
Period is expected to be approximately 4.266%. The Class
    1-A-1 Certificates
will settle with accrued interest on a 30/360 basis (24
    day delay). The
certificate balances of the Class 1-A-1 Certificates are
    subject to increases
due to the negative amortization feature of the
    mortgage loans in
Group 1 as described herein.
 
(5) The Pass-Through Rate for the Class
1-A-2 Certificates (together with the
    Class 1-A-1
Certificates, the "Class 1-A Certificates") will be a floating
    rate based on
One-Month LIBOR plus 0.380% subject to the lesser of (i) Net
    Rate Cap (equal to the
weighted average Net Rate of the Group 1 Mortgage
    Loans) and (ii)
10.50%. On the first distribution date after the Clean-Up
    Call Date, such
class's margin will be multiplied by 2.0 times the original
    certificate margin.
The Class 1-A-2 Certificates will settle flat and accrue
    interest on an
Actual/360 basis. The Class 1-A-2 Certificates are subject to
    increases in their
certificate principal balances as a result of the
    negative amortization
feature of the mortgage loans.
 
(6) The Class 1-X-1 Certificates will bear
interest at a variable pass-through
    rate equal to the
greater of (i) zero and (ii) the excess of (x) the
    weighted average of
the net rates of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans over (y) the
    weighted average
pass-through rate on the Class 1-A-2 Certificates based on
    the notional amount
equal to aggregate current principal amount of the Class
    1-A-2 Certificates.
The Class 1-X-1 will settle with accrued interest and
    accrue interest on a
30/360 basis (24 day delay).
 
(7) The Class 1-M-X Certificates will bear
interest at a variable pass-through
    rate equal to the
greater of (i) zero and (ii) the excess of (x) the
    weighted average of
the net rates of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans over (y) the
    weighted average
pass-through rate on the Class 1-B Certificates based on
    the notional amount
equal to current principal amount of the Class 1-B
    Certificates. . The
Class M-X will settle with accrued interest and accrue
    interest on a 30/360
basis (24 day delay).
 
(8) The Pass-Through Rate for the Class
1-B-1, Class 1-B-2, Class 1-B-3, Class
    1-B-4 , Class 1-B-5,
Class 1-B-6 and Class 1-B-7 Certificates (collectively,
    the "Class 1-B
Certificates") will be a floating rate based on One-Month
    LIBOR plus 0.650%,
0.700%, 1.250%, 1.500%, 1.500%, 1.500% and 1.500%,
    respectively, subject
to the lesser of (i) Net Rate Cap (equal to the
    weighted average Net
Rate of the Group 1 Mortgage Loans) and (ii) 10.50%. On
    the first distribution
date after the Clean-Up Call Date, each such class'
    margin will be
multiplied by 1.5 times the original certificate margin. The
    Class 1-B Certificates
will settle flat and accrue interest on an Actual/360
    basis. The Class 1-B
Certificates are subject to increases in their
    certificate principal
balances as a result of the negative amortization
    feature of the
mortgage loans.

Compensating Interest:    On each distribution date,
the Underlying Servicers are
                        
required to pay Compensating Interest up to the amount
                        
of its Servicing Fee to cover prepayment interest
                        
shortfalls ("Prepayment Interest Shortfalls") due to
                        
partial and/or full prepayments on the Mortgage Loans
                        
that occurred during the Prepayment Period. The
                        
Prepayment Period with respect to any Distribution Date
                        
is the period commencing on the 16th day of the month
                        
prior to the month in which the related Distribution
                        
Date occurs and ending on the 15th day of the month in
                         
which such Distribution Date occurs.
 
Collateral Description:   On November 1, 2005, the aggregate
principal balance of
                        
the Group 1 Mortgage Loans described herein is expected
                        
to be approximately $390.8 million.
 
                        
The Group 1 Mortgage Loans are indexed to the LIBOR
                        
Annual Monthly Average ("LAMA") which equates to the
                        
12-month average of 1-month LIBOR. (In order to view
                        
historical LAMA type LAMAINDX (Index)(Go) on
                        
Bloomberg.) The Group 1 Mortgage Loans have monthly
                        
coupon adjustments that allow for negative amortization
                      
   whereby interest
payments may be deferred and added to
                        
the principal balance thereof. For these loans, the
                        
monthly payment amount is subject to adjustment
                        
annually on a date specified in the mortgage note,
                        
subject to the conditions that (i) the amount of the
                        
monthly payment will not increase or decrease by an
                        
amount that is more than 7.50% of the monthly payment
                        
prior to the adjustment, (ii) as of the fifth
                        
anniversary of the first due date and on every fifth
                        
year thereafter, the monthly payment will be recast
                        
without regard to the limitation in clause (i) above
                        
and (iii) if the unpaid principal balance exceeds a
                        
percentage of 110% or 115% of the original principal
                        
balance due to deferred interest, the monthly payment
                        
will be recast without regard to the limitation in
                        
clause (i) to amortize fully the then unpaid principal
                        
balance of the mortgage loan over its remaining term to
                        
maturity.

of the November 1, 2005. It is expected that on or
                        
prior to the Closing Date, scheduled and unscheduled
                      
   principal
payments will reduce the principal balance of
                        
the mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date and may cause
                        
a decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the
                        
mortgage loans, as reflected herein, of up to 10%.
                        
CONSEQUENTLY, THE INITIAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF ANY OF
                        
THE OFFERED CERTIFICATES BY THE CLOSING DATE IS SUBJECT
                        
TO AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF UP TO 10% FROM AMOUNTS
                        
SHOWN ON THE FRONT COVER HEREOF.
 
Underwriting Standards:   The Group 1 Mortgage Loans were
underwritten to the
                        
guidelines of the Originator as more fully described in
                   
      the
prospectus supplement.
 
Credit Enhancement:       Credit
Enhancement for the Certificates will be
                        
provided by a senior/subordinate shifting interest
                        
structure. The Subordinate Certificates provide credit
                        
enhancement for the Senior Certificates.

previous Distribution Dates (and any interest thereon
                        
at the then applicable Certificate Interest Rate
                        
without giving effect to the Net Rate Cap). On any
                        
Distribution Date, the Carryover Shortfall Amount will
                        
be paid to the to the Class 1-A-2 from its related
                        
Carryover Reserve Fund and to the Class 1-B
                        
Certificates, sequentially, from their related
                        
Carryover Reserve Fund, after all of the Offered
                        
Certificates have received their required amounts (see
                        
Cash-Flow Description below).
 
Cash-Flow Description:    Distributions on the
Certificates will be made on the
                        
25th day of each month (or next business day). The
                        
payments to the Certificates, to the extent of
                        
available funds, will be made according to the
                        
following priority:
 
                        
Available Funds:
                        
1.    Payment of
interest to the holders of the Class
                             
1-A Certificates and 1-X-1 Certificates (net of
                             
Carryover Shortfall Amounts) in an amount equal to
                             
their respective Pass-Through Rates (as described
                             
on the cover page);
                        
2.    Payment of
principal to the holders of the
           
                  
Class 1-A Certificates in an amount equal to its
                             
Senior Optimal Principal Amount;
                        
3.    Payment of
interest to the Class M-X Certificates
                             
(net of Carryforward Shortfall Amount).
                        
4.    Payment of
interest and principal sequentially to
                             
the Class 1-B Certificates so each such Class
                             
shall receive (a) interest at each class'
                              
respective Pass-Through Rate, and (b) such class'
                             
Allocable Share of the Subordinate Optimal
                             
Principal Distribution Amount.
                        
5.    Payment of
any Carryover Shortfall Amounts to the
                             
Class IA-2 and Class 1- B Certificates.
 
Negative Amortization:    Since the mortgage loans are
subject to negative
                        
amortization, the Class 1-A Certificates and the
                         
Subordinate Certificates are subject to increases in
                        
their principal balances. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF
                        
NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION THAT OCCURS IN EACH INTEREST
                        
ACCRUAL PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO EACH MORTGAGE LOAN
                        
SUBGROUP WILL BE OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS FOR
                        
SUCH PERIOD ON SUCH RELATED MORTGAGE LOAN SUBGROUP. Any
                        
negative amortization for a related loan subgroup that
                        
is not offset by principal collections will be accreted
                        
pro rata to each class of Certificates.

Shifting Interest:        The
Senior Certificates (except for the Interest Only
                        
Certificates) will be entitled to receive 100% of the
                    
    
prepayments on the mortgage loans up to and including
                        
November 2015. The Senior Prepayment Percentage can be
                        
reduced to the related Senior Percentage plus 70%, 60%,
                        
40%, 20% and 0% of the related Subordinate Percentage
                        
over the next five years provided that (i) the
                        
principal balance of the mortgage loans 60 days or more
                        
delinquent, averaged over the last 6 months, as a
                        
percentage of the Current Principal Amount of the
                        
related Subordinate Certificates does not exceed 50%
                        
and (ii) cumulative realized losses for the mortgage
          
              
loans do not exceed 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% for each
                        
test date.
 
                        
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after 3 years the
                        
current Subordinate Percentage is equal to two times
                        
the initial Subordinate Percentage and (i) the
                        
principal balance of the related mortgage loans 60 days
                        
or more delinquent, averaged over the last 6 months, as
                
        
a percentage of the Current Principal Amount of the
                        
related Subordinate Certificates does not exceed 50%
                        
and (ii) cumulative realized losses for the related
                        
mortgage loans do not exceed a) on or prior to November
                        
2008, 20% or b) after November 2008, 30%, then
                        
prepayments will be allocated on a pro rata basis.
 
                        
If doubling occurs prior to the third anniversary and
                        
the above delinquency and loss tests are met, then 50%
                        
of the related subordinate prepayment percentage can be
                        
allocated to the related subordinate classes.
 
Allocation of Losses:     Realized Losses on the
mortgage loans will be allocated
                        
to the most junior class of Certificates outstanding
                        
beginning with the Class 1-B-6 Certificates, until the
                        
Certificate Principal Balance of each Subordinate Class
                        
has been reduced to zero. Thereafter, Realized Losses
                        
on the Group 1 Mortgage Loans will be allocated first
                        
to the Class 1-A-2 Certificates until zero and then to
                        
the Class 1-A-1 Certificates.
 
Corridor Cap Contract:    The issuer will benefit from
a series of interest rate
                        
cap payments from the Yield Maintenance Provider
          
              
pursuant to two corridor cap agreements (the "Corridor
                        
Cap Agreement") purchased with respect to the Class
                        
1-A-2 and Class 1-B Certificates. The Corridor Cap
                        
Agreement is intended to partially mitigate the
                        
interest rate risk that could result from the
                        
difference between the Note Interest Rate on the Class
                        
1-A-2 and Class 1-B Certificates and the Net Rate Cap
                        
with respect to the mortgage loans.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Home | Previous Page






























U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 22533 / November 16, 2012
Securities and Exchange Commission v. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, EMC Mortgage, LLC, Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities I, LLC, Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II, Inc., SACO I, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Acceptance Corporation I, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-01872 (RLW) (D.D.C. filed Nov. 16, 2012)
SEC CHARGES J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC WITH MISLEADING INVESTORS
IN RMBS OFFERINGS

In coordination with the federal-state Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, the Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and affiliated entities with misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  The firm agreed to a settlement in which it will pay $296.9 million.  The SEC plans to distribute the money to harmed investors.
The SEC alleges that JP Morgan misstated information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans that provided collateral for an RMBS offering in which it was the underwriter.  JP Morgan received fees of more than $2.7 million, and investors sustained losses of at least $37 million on undisclosed delinquent loans.  JP Morgan also is charged for Bear Stearns' failure to disclose its practice of obtaining and keeping cash settlements from mortgage loan originators on problem loans that Bear Stearns had sold into RMBS trusts.  The proceeds from this bulk settlement practice were at least $137.8 million.
According to the SEC's complaint against JP Morgan filed in federal court in Washington D.C., federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information related to assets that provide collateral for an asset-backed securities offering.  Information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans in an RMBS transaction is important to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which investors can earn interest and obtain repayment of their principal.
The SEC alleges that in the prospectus supplement for the $1.8 billion RMBS offering that occurred in December 2006, JP Morgan made materially false and misleading statements about the loans that provided collateral for the transaction.  The firm represented that only four loans (.04 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were delinquent by 30 to 59 days, and that those four were the only loans that had had an instance of delinquency of 30 or more days in the 12 months prior to the "cut-off date" for the transaction.  However, at the time JP Morgan made these representations, the firm actually had information showing that more than 620 loans (above 7 percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction) were, and had been, 30 to 59 days delinquent, and the four loans represented as being 30 to 59 days delinquent were in fact 60 to 89 days delinquent.
The SEC's complaint also alleges that Bear Stearns' bulk settlements covered loans collateralizing 156 different RMBS transactions issued from 2005 to 2007.  Loan originators were usually required by contract to buy back loans that suffered early payment defaults or had other defects.  However, Bear Stearns frequently negotiated discounted cash settlements with these loan originators in lieu of a buy-back on loans that were owned by the RMBS trusts.  The firm - both before and after the merger with JP Morgan - then kept most of the bulk settlement proceeds.   The firm failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans.  Bear Stearns repurchased only about 13 percent of these defective bulk settlement loans from the trusts, compared to a nearly 100 percent repurchase rate when loan originators agreed to buy back the defective loans.  For most loans covered by bulk settlements, the firm collected money from originators without paying anything to the trusts.
JP Morgan and J.P. Morgan Acceptance Corporation I settled the SEC's charges by consenting to pay disgorgement of $39,900,000, prejudgment interest of $10,600,000, and a penalty of $24,000,000 for the delinquency misstatements, which the SEC will seek to distribute to harmed investors in the transaction through a Fair Fund.  JP Morgan; EMC Mortgage, LLC; Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities I, LLC; Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II, Inc.; and SACO I, Inc. agreed to pay disgorgement of $137,800,000, prejudgment interest of $24,265,536, and a penalty of $60,350,000 for the bulk settlement practice misconduct, and the SEC will seek to distribute these funds to harmed investors through a separate Fair Fund.  JP Morgan and each of the other defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.
