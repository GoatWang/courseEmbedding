Dollars for Docs: Talk With Your Doctor
https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/
You can print this page and show it your doctor.
ProPublica's Dollars for Docs database lets you search for payments to U.S.-based doctors made by pharmaceutical and medical device companies between August 2013 and December 2014. The disclosure of these payments is required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. 


About This Information

The information that appears here comes directly from the federal government. Companies must attest to its accuracy and doctors have the ability to contest information they believe is in error.
This site includes payments for such activities as speaking, consulting, meals, travel and royalties. It does not include payments for clinical research.
It is legal for companies to make payments to doctors as long as the payments are not a kickback or inducement to use their products.
Some doctors say collaborative relationships, particularly those involving research, are necessary to develop new treatments and cures. But many ethicists have raised questions about the payments, and studies show that they may influence doctors' prescribing decisions.
Only you can decide if this matters to you and if so, whether you want to talk to your doctor about it. If you plan to talk with your doctor (or if you already have), please help us by filling out this short survey: propub.li/participate-d4d


Preparing for Your Conversation
If you decide you'd like to talk to your doctor about this, please keep in mind:

Many healthcare professionals in our database have similar names, so you should start by asking your doctor if the person mentioned in this payment record is really him/her.
Your doctor may not know he or she is listed as receiving payments, especially if the payments are small. You can direct your doctor to this site (the URL will be printed at the top of the payment record) or directly to the government's site here: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/1057623
Some doctors are happy to discuss this information with you. Others might not be. The best approach is to ask questions and to not be accusatory.


Questions You Might Want to Ask

Is this you?
What type of work do you do with these companies?
Have you prescribed me any drugs that are manufactured by companies you've taken payments from?
Are there non-drug alternatives that I may want to consider first?
Are there less expensive generic alternatives to the drugs you have prescribed?
What devices have you used in my care that are manufactured by companies you've taken payments from?
