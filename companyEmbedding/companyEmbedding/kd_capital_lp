Used Machines Buying Guide





A CNC Lathe is a serious investment for any machine shop operator. When you buy used CNC equipment from KD Capital, you are already saving money on a large equipment purchase, and you may also be getting a better deal than buying new. Why? - Machine shop owners usually sell the machine with accessories and add-ons that you would have to pay extra for if you bought the machine direct from the manufacturer. You can often find upgraded tool holders, conveyors, coolant systems, and CPU's at a fraction of the purchase price.
 
KD Capital works with liquidators and equipment auctions from all over the nation. We have access to CNC lathes from all brands including Mori Seiki, Mazak, Hwacheon, Daweoo, Cincinnati, Haas, Modern, Nakamura, and all major manufacturers. To save the time and cost of training, you can outfit your shop with models that your machinists are already familiar with, or you can buy upgraded and newer models that increase efficiency by a wide margin. When you're looking to get the best machine for the job, KD Capital can match you up with the right CNC Lathe, at the right price.
