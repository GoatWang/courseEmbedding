Toshiba’s TSV Technology Toshiba has started using through-silicon via (TSV) technology as part of its 48-layer 3D flash process, with shipments of product samples scheduled for release in 2H 2017. I discussed the benefits of the TSV process in a June 19, 2017 Seeking Alpha article entitled “Advanced Semiconductor Packaging Starting To Change Memory Market Landscape.”  Thus, TSV technology has allowed Toshiba to successfully increase product programming bandwidth with significantly lower power consumption. The power efficiency of the TSV device is approximately twice that of the same-generation BiCS flash memory fabricated with wire-bonding technology. TSV BiCS flash also enables the company to manufacture a 1-terabyte (TB) device with a 16-die stacked architecture in a single package, which will be used primarily for high capacity SSDs used in servers. There has been speculation that Toshiba’s financial problems and attempted sale of its memory division could disrupt supply, thereby increasing ASPs for NAND. With this announcement, it is apparent that Toshiba is continuing technology advancement for its 3D-NAND business. This advanced manufacturing technology will serve to bolster Toshiba’s valuation to prospective purchasers, a consortium led by US-based private equity fund Bain Capital and Japanese state-run financial institutions. SK Hynix and IoT SK Hynix just signed a two-year NVM IP cooperation contract with privately held eMemory. Why is this important? Taiwan-based eMemory will provide technology support to SK Hynix to develop its wafer foundry business at its wholly-owned foundry subsidiary SK Hynix System IC. But the key takeaway here is that the contract will strengthen SK’s capacity for system-on-chips (SoC) ICs, enhancing its foundry services for fabless IC design houses, to incorporate embedded memory into SoCs for IoT (and other) applications. eMemory's eNVM IP products have been adopted by a number of foundry houses, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), United Microelectronics (UMC), Globalfoundries, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), who are incorporating the embedded memory into SoC and other chips. According to The Information Network’s report entitled “Semiconductor Demand Analysis for Smart Technology – Smart Cities, Energy, Homes, Transportation, Factory, Health,” the real semiconductor beneficiaries of Smart Technology, which is a subset of IoT, will be microcontrollers, sensors, and connectivity. This is illustrated on the left of the graphic courtesy of BlueApp.io. IoT end-node smart devices are often controlled by an SoC, which combines an MCU, an RF transceiver, and embedded flash memory.  

 There has been much speculation that memory growth will come from IoT. That may be the case for network and cloud applications (the right side of the above graphic) but not for the smart devices that are interconnected. IoT represents a marketplace for a variety of traditional and emerging memory based on the device and application. Traditional NAND flash will be used in the IoT space requiring high capacity storage, while NOR flash will be used in gateways and set-top boxes. DRAMs will be used where high-end graphics and interface applications demand computational power and performance. Of course there are other reasons, but I'm not writing a doctoral dissertation here! Embedded multi-media cards (eMMC), which combine NAND flash memory with controller/interface circuits, are suitable for such applications because of their low cost and their ability to serve as a replacement for traditional storage media. eMMC, however, will face stiff competition from UFS 2.0 and 2.1, which offer sequential read/write speeds fast enough to rival SSDs while combining it with the low-power consumption of eMMC. Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) is using UFS 2.0 and 2.1 in its Galaxy 8 smartphone. Micron Technology (MU) also manufacturers USF 2.1. For smart devices, the SoCs require reduced power consumption, reduced system footprint, and reduced cost. Also, use of NVM makes it unnecessary to copy code to on-chip RAM on power up from external memory. External Flash is not cost effective when the size is less than 1 Mbit as the “cost per bit” is high. There is also a power penalty for Execute-in-Place applications, which are executed directly from NVM. But clearly there is a move from discrete memory devices to embedded memory at the edge. eMemory, which signed the cooperation contract with SK Hynix, makes OTP (one-time programmable) and MTP (multiple-time programmable) eNVM IP products. These memory devices have witnessed significant growth as the memories are a strong fit for IoT dimension and performance requirements: Embedded OTP NVM for in-networking and data-security applications with its low cost and ease of manufacturing. Embedded MTP NVM offering small on-chip reprogrammable memory for applications requiring longer battery life, since external memory consumes more power. Another embedded memory competitor is embedded flash memory (eFlash) utilization has been strong for devices requiring data and code storage. Here’s the problem for memory suppliers. Embedded memory is not only manufactured by memory companies, but by most foundries. This is the strategy of eMemory, which I discussed above, whose embedded memory products have been adopted by TSM, UMC, Globalfoundries, and SMIC. These foundries manufacture SoCs and incorporate embedded memory into their chip, whose architectures are supplied by not only memory manufacturers but by fabless IC companies such as eMemory, eSilicon, and Silicon Storage (a subsidiary of Microchip Technology (MCHP)), to name a few. Embedded memory is also manufactured by IDMs (integrated device manufacturers). Investor Takeaway Traditional memory such as NAND, NOR, and DRAMs, whose dominion is being challenged by fabless embedded memory manufacturers, are also being impacted by non-traditional memory technologies, particularly MRAM (Magnetoresistive random-access memory). SK Hynix has a major MRAM development effort underway. Samsung Electronics bought MRAM startup Grandis and has a materials-related research relationship with IBM. TSMC is working with TDK on its program, and Sony is building high-performance MRAMs for startup Avalanche Technology. And MRAM is also moving to the embedded memory stage. Everspin (MRAM) for example, has shipped nearly 60 million discrete MRAMs, manufactured at GlobalFoundries, largely to the cache buffering and industrial markets. The two companies now working together to manufacture embedded MRAM, which according to GlobalFoundries, should only require a few extra mask layers to be integrated into the BEOL in logic. Thus the notion that IoT is a driver for memory is true, but not necessarily for edge devices for traditional discrete manufacturers. SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics have each moved to establish a foundry, which would be used to not only utilize their own embedded memories in their SoCs, but would contract with other fabless IC companies to manufacture their parts.

Photronics Looks A Bit More Interesting - Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Photronics Looks A Bit More InterestingJul.13.17 | About: Photronics, Inc. (PLAB) Vince Martin Long/short equity, value, gambling




SummaryThe market didn't like PLAB's Q2 report: shares dropped 11% and kept falling, reaching their lowest close in almost a year.The pessimism seems a bit overdone: the quarter wasn't terrible, and there's still optimism toward the back half.A new JV in China seems a notable change in strategy - but an interesting move.Below $10, PLAB is getting interesting.A major issue for Photronics (PLAB) is that it's simply got a tough business. Photronics makes photomasks, used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and flat-panel displays. It's a reasonably commoditized and low-growth business to begin with. Add to that increasing share of so-called 'captive' suppliers (those owned by chip makers such as Intel (INTC)) and Photronics has a tough road to hoe. Of course, PLAB's valuation reflects that fact. The trailing twelve-month EV/EBITDA multiple is about 3.4x (though a large overseas cash balance and high D&A and capex deflate that number quite a bit). Near $10, PLAB trades at a single-digit multiple to FY18 EPS estimates plus cash. With the stock above $11 in January, I didn't think PLAB was quite interesting enough. Back in the single-digits, however, PLAB looks like it might be worth a flyer. The market didn't like the fiscal Q2 release, but management still is optimistic toward the back half of the year. A new JV in China seems like an intriguing entry into that key market - and also should limit the upfront investment Photronics originally had planned. I'd probably still like to see PLAB a touch cheaper, and was a bit slow in timing the bottom. But even after a mildly disappointing quarter, the bull case for the stock looks a bit stronger now that it did earlier this year. A Disappointing First Half There's obviously a cyclical aspect to Photronics sales and profits (the latter in particular due to high fixed costs). And the recent trend has been disappointing. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 in FY16 (ending October), down from $0.64 the year before. In the first half of FY17, the declines continued, with adjusted EPS falling to just $0.05 from $0.28 in the year-prior period. And Q3 guidance appears to have missed analyst expectations badly, with guidance of $0.05-$0.12 light against consensus of $0.17.
 So the question at the moment is whether management's optimism on the Q2 conference call is valid - and to what extent that optimism might be priced in, even with recent declines in the stock. Q3 guidance, while below expectations, still implies a sequential improvement. And there's reason to expect continued improvement in Q4 - and beyond. New tools are coming online will be installed in Q3 and Q4 - and should be "fully utilized", per the Q2 call. High-end flat panel demand is rising, thanks to OLED and AMOLED capacity buildouts. Photronics saw double-digit growth Q/Q in that category - the first sequential growth in several quarters - and expects further improvement going forward. Management also was optimistic toward 28nm business through United Microelectronics (UMC), as the company builds out in China. That business admittedly could be at risk; there's some skepticism about UMC's positioning in that space and a potential long-term decline. But it does seem like PLAB could return to YOY improvement as soon as Q4, and could be set up for a solid FY18 if even some of the current trends hold. The China JV The more interesting development, announced in conjunction with Q2 earnings, is a new joint venture in China with Dai Nippon Printing (OTCPK:DNPLY). Photronics received a $93 million payment from Micron (MU) after ending a JV, and planned to use that cash to support a five-year, $160 million investment in the country. With Chinese subsidies aiming to keep production in-country, that move made some sense. CEO Peter Kirlin said on the Q4 FY15 conference call that there was only one domestic merchant (ie, non-captive) supplier in the market. That seemed to create an opportunity for Photronics to head off competition (including Dai Nippon) while trying to keep captives from taking all of the key Chinese market. This is the second JV with DNP, after one created in Taiwan in 2014. That venture appears to be a success so far, per commentary from Kirlin on the Q2 call. The question in China - in fact, the first question on the Q2 call - is why Photronics needed to do the JV at all. Photronics has the cash - $140 million-plus is held overseas. The JV does limit the risk - DNP will be funding ~$80 million or so of the original investment, plus startup costs - but the 50/50 split also limits reward.
 On the Q2 call, Photronics argued that there were benefits to the partnership that made it a better option - beyond lower costs. The combined JV should be able to ramp faster, given that both companies already have some level of operations in-country. And it creates an "one-stop shop" for customers in terms of development efforts. Both aspects are beneficial toward one key goal: "ensur[ing] that no more captives spring up" in the market. Valuation All told, coming out of the quarter, there is a case for PLAB at $10. A 3.4x EV/EBITDA multiple (which should still be below 4x at year's end, even assuming a ~flat Q4) leaves the stock reasonably cheap. Normalized capex suggests a 13-14x P/FCF multiple at the moment. Support has held repeatedly in the low $9 range. PLAB might not have explosive upside quite yet, but there's an "if you limit the downside, the upside takes care of itself eventually" argument here. Cyclical help starting in Q4 would be a boost. A repatriation tax holiday, particularly with lower capex needs in China, could allow PLAB to return capital to shareholders. (Its credit facility does preclude cash dividend payments, however.) UMC's China operations should have a head start on peers, providing a near-term boost for PLAB if 28nm demand holds up. Where PLAB gets interesting over the next year or so is that it probably doesn't need any of those drivers to stay at least within the range of the current price. And if mix toward higher-end - from FPD, 28nm, or elsewhere - allows margins to recover, plus sales rebound, PLAB could look ridiculously cheap in 9-12 months. Again, this is a difficult business and not a stock without risk. But there are some reasons to think that the recent performance of Photronics as a company, and PLAB as a stock, should reverse.

Ben Affleck Really Wants You To Believe He's Not Leaving Batman


At Comic-con Saturday, the audience for Hall H-some having waited in line all night-lost every ounce of their minds as soon as Warner Bros. panel moderator Chris Hardwick (who acknowledged gratefully the lengths some fans had gone to) queued up the DCEU roll-out.Affleck will reprise his role of Batman in Justice League after previously playing him in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and dropping by in a cameo in Suicide Squad.Reeves is set to direct "The Batman" and has eyes on making a trilogy with the character."I know there's this misconception because I didn't direct it that I wasn't enthusiastic about it", he said at the San Diego event promoting "Justice League". "I am thrilled to do it"."Let me be very clear". Studio president Toby Emmerich disputed the notion, telling the website, "Ben is our Batman".


United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) Upgraded by BidaskClub to "Buy"
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased its position in shares of United Microelectronics Corporation by 37.9% in the first quarter. Additionally Cabot Microelectronics Corporat recently announced a dividend which will be paid on Friday the 28th of July 2017.
Ben Affleck is the latest - some say the greatest - Batman!But the DC hype was running full steam, unveiling a new Justice League trailer (in theaters November 17) and a video montage of movies coming up, including Suicide Squad 2, Justice League Dark, Batgirl (directed by Joss Whedon), Flashpoint (featuring Miller), Green Lantern Corps and Wonder Woman 2. "I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world".A new poster for Justice League was also unveiled at Comic-Con, taking inspiration from the famed comic-book paintings from artist Alex Ross.Affleck said he's contracted to do two more Batman movies after "Batman v Superman", which includes this year's "Justice League" and the Matt Reeves-directed solo adventure "The Batman", which Affleck was originally going to direct before backing out. In the original Flashpoint story, written by Johns, The Flash met an alternate universe Batman, who was really Thomas Wayne, a gun-toting Batman obsessed with revenge for the murder of his son Bruce and wife Martha. For a long time we've been hearing rumors that Ben Affleck was considering moving on from the iconic role of Batman, and anonymous sources told The Hollywood Reporter that Warner Bros. "It's a great time in the DC universe... and you can see why I am so excited to play Batman".

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: April 07, 1999

 Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), one of the world's leading semiconductor foundries, has grown dramatically in 16 years. UMC pursued a strategy of vertical disintegration as part of the chairman's vision of turning UMC into a "pure-play" foundry. This case discusses the major technological and competitive forces affecting the industry and looks at UMC's restructuring through the eyes of the chairman. Provides enough detail to engage the class in a discussion of the merits of UMC's vertical disintegration strategy and the possible pitfalls of this approach going forward.
