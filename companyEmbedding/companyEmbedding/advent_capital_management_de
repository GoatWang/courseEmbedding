About Us
 
 






 


Advent invests primarily in convertible, high yield and equity securities.  The firm manages approximately $9.3 billion (as of June 30, 2017) in long-only products, hedge funds and closed-end funds - providing a broad view of the market and the ability to take advantage of opportunities across the entire capital structure, globally. Our structure enables us to fully understand and implement various investment strategies including stocks, bonds, convertibles, credit default swaps, options and other derivatives.
Advent manages three synergistic lines of business which includes long-only strategies, hedge fund strategies and closed-end funds which are listed on the NYSE.  Since inception, our credit-driven research focus has been a core driver of our investment success in both long-only and hedged strategies. Our success can be measured by the consistent performance we have achieved across the firm’s products.
We add value by performing thorough internal credit research that translates into consistent returns with low volatility by protecting against the downside. We utilize a dynamic bottom-up, relative value approach to security selection. Our proprietary credit driven research process is designed to identify the most attractive securities with stable-to-improving fundamentals which offer upside potential and downside protection.
Our global infrastructure is supported by a team of highly talented investment professionals with deep experience across the entire capital structure in global convertible, equity, high yield and bank loan markets. With offices in New York and London we are able to trade seamlessly around the clock.

Convertible Market Trends
 
 






 



The global primary market has been strong, as the global convertible market has grown over the past three years.
The convertible market is now approximately USD 420 billion globally and over USD 220 billion in the US*.
Liquidity and diversification have increased substantially with the growth of the market. The quality of issuers has also improved as almost 25% of global convertibles are investment grade rated and over 90% of the issuers are large cap (>$5 billion market cap) or mid cap (>$1 billion market cap) companies.
Convertibles have a broad cross-over investor base which lends support to the asset class. Both traditional fixed-income and equity investors have the ability to purchase convertibles, unlike other asset classes such as bank loans.
Key drivers that make the current convertible market attractive:

More higher coupon convertibles in place of new issues with low or zero coupons
Maturities shortened from 25-30 years to 5-7 years on average which provide enhanced downside protection
Call protection extended from 2-3 years up to 5-7 years in many cases
Common use of ratchet and dividend protection features that protect investors from the negative impact of takeovers and dividend increases
Conversion premiums on new issues have come down significantly allowing for greater participation in the upside of the underlying stock

Advent Capital Management Expands UCITS Offering with Global Absolute Return Strategy | Business Wire


























































Advent Capital Management Expands UCITS Offering with Global Absolute 
      Return Strategy




Fund’s Launch Marks Expansion of Advent’s Alternatives Offerings to 
      European Investors






February 25, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Advent Capital Management, LLC (“Advent”), an investment management firm 
      with approximately $8.5 billion in assets under management, today 
      announced it will launch a new UCITS regulated umbrella fund* domiciled 
      in Ireland, which will include the Advent Global Absolute Return 
      Strategy, during the second quarter of 2015. The UCITS fund marks the 
      first alternatives product in Advent’s UCITS offerings and is an 
      extension of Advent’s successful Global Opportunity Strategy. It will be 
      co-managed by portfolio managers Odell Lambroza and Matthew Dundon.
    


      Advent has built a seven-year track record in its global opportunities, 
      relative value and event-driven focused hedge fund, positioning the 
      Global Absolute Return Strategy to invest in similar opportunities 
      across geographies, while complying with the UCITS IV framework. The 
      strategy is flexible and opportunistic, spanning corporate capital 
      structures and leverages the knowledge of Advent’s expert in-house 
      investment research team. The new UCITS fund will be asset class 
      agnostic and will be optimally positioned to implement Advent’s 
      fundamental views under various market conditions.
    

      “The expansion of our UCITS product offerings into alternatives 
      reinforces Advent’s dedication to our European investors and reflects 
      our proficiency in the alternatives space,” said Kris Haber, Chief 
      Operating Officer at Advent Capital. “Given the number of opportunities 
      that currently exist in fixed income, offering a credit UCIT strategy is 
      a natural step for Advent and our clients,” said Robert Gourlay, 
      Managing Director and Head of European Business Development. “The 
      product is an excellent complement to our existing lineup and meets the 
      significant credit demand we’ve had from our relationships in Europe.”
    

      Odell Lambroza has 24 years of industry experience, the last 13 of which 
      he’s spent at Advent managing the Global Opportunity Strategy and 
      investing across the entire capital structure. Prior to Advent, he 
      served as Managing Director of the Convertible Securities Department at 
      SG Cowen and as Vice President of Structured Equity Derivative Products, 
      Asset Swaps, and Convertible Trading at Merrill Lynch.
    

      Matthew Dundon joined Advent from Pine River Capital where he co-led a 
      team of analysts focused on North American high yield, distressed debt, 
      reorganized equities and messanine investing. He was also involved in 
      distressed and special opportunities in Asia, Europe and the Middle 
      East. Prior to Pine River, he was head of research at GMP Securities and 
      has also practiced leveraged finance and securities law.

Time off is horrible. Hours are long and flexibility is non-existent. When people tell you to quit on the first day you start working you should probably listen.

Upper management couldn't care less about employees.Advice to ManagementBring your egos down. Think about your employees and how you treat them and speak to them.

There are tight knit groups who support and look out for one another, especially those who understand if one succeeds we all succeed. Many have managed to work through the ranks, achieving goals and exceeding their own expectations. Advancement and increased responsibility are not only encouraged -they are expected. The firm has thrived in a challenging environment which is a testament to management's leadership. There is an open door policy for those with suggestions on how to improve the firm.ConsNo company is perfect, many have flaws. It's unfortunate that Negative Nancy's and Debbie Downers are trying to discredit the firm and those working here. As a long term employee I felt it was important to address the negative write up. To me, and others who work here at Advent, it is obvious who wrote the poor review: we know who you are because you're not here any more. The reality is it's your own fault; you exhibit a lack of productivity and a bad attitude. You lost credibility with your lunch line guard story -if you don't want the free lunch, why not go out and get your own food? Better stated, why not fix your energy and your efforts: be productive. Be positive. Be a somebody instead of a nobody caught in your own web of negativity. In my view, your write up was a pathetic attempt to discredit your former firm.Advice to ManagementAfter twenty plus years of building this firm it is important to remember that we all have flaws. Great achievements were made through the help of hard working employees and your ability to navigate through extremely challenging times. There have been a few losers who managed to make it through the interview process. An honest appraisal and stringent vetting of candidates would prevent a lot of headaches (and post-mortem pity parties) in the future.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Advent Asset Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Advent Asset Management 2017-06-20 12:34 PDT Jul 19, 2017 Helpful (2) Advent Asset Management Logo"Stay away..
