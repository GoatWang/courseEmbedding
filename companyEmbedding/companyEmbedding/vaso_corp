Vaso Corporation Announces Financial Results for First Quarter 2017HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)LISTENWho is the face of pro baseball?Yahoo Finance's Dan Roberts and Myles Udland debate the business of baseballVaso Corporation Announces Financial Results for First Quarter 2017AccesswireMay 15, 2017ReblogShareTweetSharePLAINVIEW, NY / ACCESSWIRE / May 15, 2017 / Vaso Corporation ("Vaso") (OTC PINK: VASO) today reported its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017."Our revenue decreased by $1.2 million, or 7%, in the first quarter of 2017 when compared to the first quarter of the prior year, principally due to a decrease in revenue in the professional sales service segment as a result of a lower equipment delivery volume in the quarter by our partner. We expect this to improve during the remainder of this year as our order bookings in the past several quarters were very strong and deferred commission revenue went up $2.1 million or 13% from a year ago," stated Dr. Jun Ma, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vaso Corporation. "Our information technology, or IT, segment remains the most significant contributor to the Company's revenue, at 60% of total for the first quarter of 2017, and this is also the segment we anticipate most of the growth in the near future. Within the IT segment, a substantial backlog has been built in the healthcare IT VAR business, and it continues to grow.""Therefore, while we experienced a decrease in revenue and net income in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to see much improvement and continued profitability in 2017. Our financial position remains strong as we continue to generate positive cash flow from operating activities," concluded Dr. Ma.Financial Results for Three Months Ended March 31, 2017For the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenue decreased 7% to $16.4 million from $17.5 million for the same period of 2016, due to the decrease of $1.0 million in commission revenue in our professional sales service segment as a result of lower volume of equipment deliveries, as well as lower volume of equipment sales in our equipment segment, partially offset by an increase in revenue in our IT segment.Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 decreased 9% to $9.1 million, compared with a gross profit of $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in revenue in the professional sales service segment resulting in a decrease in segment gross profit of $0.8 million and a decrease in gross profit in the equipment segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profit in the IT segment.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2017 increased 10% to $10.7 million, compared to $9.7 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs and timing of meeting costs (in the first quarter of 2017 instead of the second quarter of 2016) in the professional sales service segment.Research and development costs increased 50% to $221 thousand in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to an increase in software development costs.Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2.1 million, compared with a net loss of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.Net cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash at March 31, 2017 was $6.7 million, compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2016.Deferred revenue remains substantial, at approximately $19.8 million as of March 31, 2017, which will be recognized in the future when the underlying equipment or services are delivered and accepted at the customer site.
