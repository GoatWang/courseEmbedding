Rochelle B. Lazarus


A Focus on Citizenship


An Interview with Rochelle B. Lazarus, Chairman, Ogilvy & Mather


Editors’ Note
Shelly Lazarus has held positions of increasing responsibility with Ogilvy for more than three decades, including as General Manager for Ogilvy & Mather Direct (now known as OgilvyOne Worldwide) in the United States, President of Ogilvy & Mather Advertising in New York, President of Ogilvy North America, and COO and President of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. She was named CEO in 1996, and became Chairman in 1997, a title that she retains after having relinquished the CEO title in 2009. Lazarus also serves on the boards of General Electric; New York-Presbyterian Hospital; American Museum of Natural History; Partnership for New York City; the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy; and Columbia Business School. She is also a member of Advertising Women of New York; the Council on Foreign Relations; The Business Council; and the Deloitte WIN External Advisory Council. Lazarus received an undergraduate degree from Smith College and an M.B.A. from Columbia University.
Company Brief
Ogilvy & Mather (www.ogilvy.com), based in New York, is one of the largest marketing communications networks in the world, with more than 450 offices in 120 countries, specializing in advertising, relationship and interactive marketing, public relations, sales promotion, and related services. The agency services Fortune Global 500 companies, including American Express, BP, Cisco, Coca-Cola, DuPont, Ford, GlaxoSmithKline, IBM, Kimberly-Clark, Kraft, Mattel, Motorola, Nestlé, SAP, Unilever, and Yum! Brands, Inc. Ogilvy & Mather is a subsidiary of WPP Group plc.
This company understood community engagement early on. How critical is that at a time when corporate responsibility is being heavily promoted?
It has been part of our core and culture. What is lucky for us is that what we know how to do fits so perfectly in the world of philanthropy. You almost can’t create a movement or drive a mission for the world without great communications.
So we’ve had an obvious central role in the world of corporate citizenship from the very start. It has been less about writing checks and more about contributing our time, attention, passion, and skills to causes all over the world and covering almost every field of endeavor.
It is also so motivating to the staff; to take what you know how to do professionally and apply it to something you believe in works magic on the way you feel about your professional life.
Is there a real shift today in drawing the line between business and philanthropy?
The line is completely blurred – it’s not even about philanthropy but about citizenship. There is an expectation now that companies will behave as responsible citizens of the local and global community. So GE’s ecomagination was something you could argue is of enormous value to the quality of the environment, but it also has an economic imperative because all GE customers are trying to do more with less. Therefore, GE is making products to satisfy their customers’ needs, but those customer needs are all about having products that are friendlier to the environment.
It’s a wonderful, virtuous circle now and what might have been considered philanthropy 25 years ago is not philanthropy at all – it’s smart business.
Do shareholders understand that transition and how it has evolved?
The enlightened ones do. Most companies I know proclaim they are market driven. The market has spoken and the market cares what the ethos is of a company. Those who demonstrate that they don’t care about their role in society and the contribution they make are marked down for it.
Is it important that the citizenship efforts align with the business strategy and are there examples where it has worked effectively?
Absolutely. There are so many examples, the most obvious being Ronald McDonald House. So much of McDonald’s business comes from providing healthy meals for children, so giving back for them means helping children who have health issues.
Coca-Cola’s focus on water is another one, as well as Avon’s focus on breast cancer and domestic violence. Avon sees itself as not just making products that sell to women but being about an affirmation of women’s role in society and women’s independence.
Ecomagination comes out of what GE does, and the Dove Self-Esteem Fund for young women comes from Dove’s focus on helping the world understand what real beauty is.
DuPont worked with a town in North Carolina to rebuild their infrastructure after a tornado, but in a sustainable way, so they contributed DuPont sustainable products – it was like a live product demo of the future of DuPont’s R&D efforts in sustainability.
The world has moved beyond writing checks to having all the giving back to the community come out of the heart of what the company does. That’s so much more potent, because you’re dealing with the economic power of the entire enterprise – not just the philanthropy budget.
For a company like Ogilvy with a number of resources around the world, is it tough to sometimes have to say no to certain causes?
It is, but if there is someone within this company who believes strongly in a certain enterprise and wants to devote his personal time to helping that organization figure out how to communicate and motivate people better, I don’t stand in the way. So these become individual choices. But without a champion within the agency, it won’t work.
We have another great advantage these days because so much of our client activities are focused on these efforts that have societal impact. So you don’t have to beg for philanthropy. When you work on Dove, for instance, you’re working on self-esteem for young women. It’s not what you do late at night; it’s your day job.
Are young people today looking for a philanthropic company culture?
Absolutely. It used to close the sale to people who were coming into the company, but now we start with it. And the younger you are, the more it matters.
No matter how large this company has grown, the values are never lost. What is it about Ogilvy that has made it work so well?
We were lucky because we had a founder who laid out a culture before he had any clients. He was a great copywriter, so it was expressed in a way that once you heard it, you could not help but remember it.
Strong cultures tend to attract people who are taken with the culture and repel people for whom the culture doesn’t resonate. So it’s a self-perpetuating machine, because the stronger your culture is, the stronger it continues to be, because you immediately know when you walk in the door as a potential employee if this is the right place for you and vice versa. 
Is the business still exciting for you?
Every time you go to a new client with a new set of opportunities, problems, or issues, it’s like having a new job. That’s what keeps me fresh.•

Lazarus, Rochelle "Shelly"

Most Popular






 

Rochelle "Shelly" Lazarus, chairman-CEO of  Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, was born in New York in 1947. She attended Smith College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1968. That year, looking for a job in order to help put her fiance through medical school, she found that career options for women were limited; the choices seemed to be to learn typing and be a secretary or to become a teacher. It was suggested that with a graduate degree she might find a job in which she would not have to type. So she enrolled at Columbia University, where she was one of four women in a class of 275. She graduated in 1970 with a master's degree in business.

Ms. Lazarus found her life transformed by two events while in graduate school. First, she took an internship at General Foods Corp., where she worked in the Maxwell House division on the introduction of Maxim. Second, she found a required marketing course enjoyable. 

After graduating from Columbia, Ms. Lazarus joined haircare products marketer Clairol Inc. as an assistant product manager. In 1971, she was approached by a recruiter for Ogilvy & Mather, which was looking to add an account exec to its haircare products team. Ms. Lazarus planned to spend only two years in advertising before moving on, but she joined the agency while founder David Ogilvy was still an active presence in the company, and she has credited Mr. Ogilvy's dedication to big ideas and creativity as a guiding influence on her own career and business philosophies. She chose to stay.

As an account manager, Ms. Lazarus handled Ogilvy's high-profile accounts, including American Express Co., Lever Bros. and AT&T Corp., earning a reputation as a business strategist who worked hard to build relationships with senior clients. 

One of her earliest victories came in 1992, when she helped regain the then-$60 million American Express account after the financial-services marketer had moved its business to Chiat/Day. Ms. Lazarus, who by then had spent six years as group account director on the American Express business, was in charge of the team sent to retake the account. 

She leveraged her relationships with American Express President Lou Gerstner and his marketing chief, Abby Kohnstamm, as well as utilizing new research and creative work by Ogilvy. With that win firmly under her belt, Ms. Lazarus was rewarded with a promotion in 1989 to president of O&M Direct U.S., Ogilvy's direct marketing division. In 1991, she moved to president of Ogilvy's New York office.

The relationships that Ms. Lazarus had built over the years with Mr. Gerstner and Ms. Kohnstamm paid off again in 1994, when those executives moved to IBM Corp. and handed Ogilvy the $500 million IBM global advertising business; IBM's choice of Ogilvy represented the single biggest account switch in advertising history at that time. The move helped propel Ms. Lazarus in 1995 to the position of president-chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. She succeeded Charlotte Beers as CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in 1996, and in 1997 she became chairman.

As chairman of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, Ms. Lazarus has been a steadfast advocate of the agency's concept of "brand stewardship," introduced by Ms. Beers in 1992, in which the agency sets out to build a brand over its lifetime, and its newer incarnation, "360 degree branding," introduced by Ms. Lazarus to help the agency uncover the emotional subtleties that consumers perceive as characterizing attributes of a brand. Ms. Lazarus has served on Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide's board as well as on its executive committee since 1991. In 2000, she served as the chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. 

Ms. Lazarus has been recognized for her leadership role by the Advertising Women of New York, which named her its "Advertising Woman of the Year" in 1994. She also was a recipient of the Women in Communications' Matrix Award and was named "Business Woman of the Year" by the New York City Partnership. Since 1998, she has been listed among the top 10 women in Fortune's annual ranking of the "50 Most Powerful Women in American Business."

Rochelle “Shelly” Lazarus ’70Chairman Emeritus, Ogilvy & Mather, New YorkDuring her 30-plus years with Ogilvy & Mather, Shelly Lazarus has worked in every product category, in both the general advertising and direct marketing disciplines. Rising through the ranks of account service, she has held positions of increasing responsibility in the management of the company, including president of O&M Direct North America, Ogilvy & Mather New York, Ogilvy North America, chief operating officer, and CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. She is currently chairman emeritus.

	A graduate of Smith College, Ms. Lazarus has been widely recognized by her peers in the advertising and business communities. She was named Advertising Woman of the Year in 1994 by Advertising Women of New York. She was a recipient of the Women in Communications Matrix Award in 1995 and was named Business Woman of the Year by the New York City Partnership in 1996. She has been listed in Fortune magazine’s annual ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in American Business since its inception in 1998. The Direct Marketing Association named her Woman of the Year in 2002. In 2003, she was the first woman honored by Columbia Business School with its Distinguished Leadership in Business Award.

	She serves on the boards of a number of industry, business, and academic institutions, including General Electric, Merck & Co., Inc., NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the World Wildlife Fund, and the American Museum of Natural History. She served for five years as chairman of the board of trustees of Smith College, her alma mater. She has also served as chairman of the leading industry trade group, the American Association of Advertising Agencies — one of only two women to do so in the organization’s history.

	Ms. Lazarus is a frequent speaker at industry and leadership forums, not only promoting the power of brands but also commenting on leadership, women in business, and career and life issues — something she speaks from experience as the wife of Dr. George Lazarus, a New York pediatrician, and mother to their three grown children.

The Business Biography of Rochelle Lazarus














































Rochelle Lazarus



Ogilvy & Mather CEO Rochelle Lazarus pioneered the concept of '360-degree  brand handling' to enable clients to make a lasting impression whenever they  come into contact with their target audience.
She is responsible for developing many of Ogilvy's  blue-chip clients, such as Kodak and IBM. 
Ogilvy is also responsible for  building the most popular brands in the world today: American Express, Barbie,  Dove, Ford, Kodak, Pond's Shell, Sears, and others.
Rochelle Lazarus - No Degree of Separation 
                After graduating from Smith   College in the late-1960s, Shelly  Lazarus went to Columbia Business   School for her MBA. She was one of  only three females in the class.She joined Ogilvy & Mather in 1971, one of the biggest  ad agencies in the world to this day, as part of account service. This gave her  the opportunity to work and gain experience across all product categories. She  became its chief in 1997, and within five years, the company was named North  American Agency of the Year by Advertising Age.



                Lazarus created the Ogilvy cornerstone of 360-degree  branding. It is a stewardship concept that uses the widest array possible of  methods and tools, the goal being to nurture the connection between consumer  and brand.              
The firm aggressively adopted the Lazarus concept for its  local and global policies in more than 120 countries. This was due to the fact  that it was the perfect innovation on the Ogilvy founder's philosophy of the  best advertising being the one that builds brands. 
 Since Fortune magazine began listing the 50 Most Powerful  Women in American Business in 1998 - barely a year after Shelly Lazarus took  over Ogilvy - she has been named yearly.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
