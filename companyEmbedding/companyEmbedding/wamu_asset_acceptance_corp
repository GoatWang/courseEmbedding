Long Beach Mortgage Securizations Get WaMu Shelf Registration

Long Beach Mortgage Securizations Get WaMu Shelf Registration

January 9, 2007
Paul Jackson




KEYWORDS Asset-backed security Company Founded Economics Finance Fixed income securities Long Beach Mortgage Mortgage loan Personal finance Securitization Structured finance Subprime lending WAMU WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. Washington Mutual

Washington Mutual said today that it will securitize subprime mortgage loans originated by its Long Beach Mortgage division using a different shelf registration in 2007.

Beginning with its first transaction in 2007, WaMu will securitize all loans originated through its Long Beach Mortgage division using the WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. shelf registration, which is also used for WaMu's prime, Alt A conduit and subprime conduit securitizations.


The new trusts will be designated â€œWaMu Asset-Backed Certificates, WaMu Series 200X-HEX Trust.â€? The name â€œLong Beach Mortgage Loan Trustâ€? will no longer be used with respect to new securitizations.

In spite of industry speculation that Long Beach Mortgage had run into problems with its warehouse credit facility, Washington Mutual said the move was made to consolidate LBM's operations.

WaMu said it believes the new name reflects the many positive changes made to its broker-sourced business model throughout 2006, according to Doug Potolsky, Washington Mutual's Senior Vice President of Subprime Capital Markets. â€œWe've made many changes in LBMC's business model and operations beginning when we consolidated its operations into WaMu and this is a logical next step. For these reasons, we feel it is appropriate to brand our Long Beach Mortgage securitized product offerings as Washington Mutual product offerings.â€?

The first transaction using the new name is expected to close in January.

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

	With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Mortgage Loan for which a Payoff has been made after the related Cut-off Date and prior to the related Closing Date), in instances where, due to a delay on the part of the recording office, any
	Recording Documents are not included in the Mortgage File delivered to the Purchaser or its designee on or before the related Closing Date, the Seller shall transmit the Recording Documents to the Purchaser or its designee within 270 days after the related Closing
	Date. In instances where, due to a delay on the part of the recording office where any such Recording Documents have been delivered for recordation, the Recording Documents cannot be delivered to the Purchaser or its designee within 270 days after such Closing Date,
	the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser or its designee within such time period a Seller Officer’s Certificate stating the date by which the Seller expects to receive such Recording Documents from the applicable recording office. In the event that Recording
	Documents have still not been received by the Seller and delivered to the Purchaser or its designee by the date specified in its previous Seller Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Purchaser or its designee, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser or its
	designee by such date an additional Seller Officer’s Certificate stating a revised date by which the Seller expects to receive the applicable Recording Documents. This procedure shall be repeated until the Recording Documents have been received by the Seller
	and delivered to the Purchaser or its designee.

	Section 2.4.          Repurchases of and Substitutions for Defective Mortgage Loans




	(a)                Upon receipt of notice from the Purchaser that any document, required to be included (pursuant to the definition of “Mortgage File”) in the
	Mortgage File delivered to the Purchaser or its designee with respect to a Mortgage Loan sold by the Seller hereunder, was not included therein or has not been executed, the Seller shall correct or cure such defect within 90 days from the date the Seller receives
	notice thereof or, if such defect cannot be corrected or cured within such 90-day period, the Seller shall, not later than the expiration of such 90-day period, either (a) repurchase such Mortgage Loan from the Purchaser or its transferee at the Repurchase Price or
	(b) within the three-month period commencing on the related Closing Date (or within the two-year period commencing on such Closing Date if the related Mortgage Loan is a “defective obligation” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) of the Code
	and Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)), substitute for such Mortgage Loan one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans each of which is a “qualified replacement mortgage” (as defined in the Code);

	provided, however,

	that in the event that
	such defect consists solely of the failure of the Seller to deliver any Recording Document with respect to such Mortgage Loan, due to a delay on the part of the recording office, then the Seller shall not be required to repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage
	Loan. If such defect would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a “qualified mortgage” (as defined in the Code), then notwithstanding the previous sentence, the repurchase or substitution must occur within the sooner of (i) 90 days from the date the
	defect was discovered by the Seller, the Purchaser or any other party to the related Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (ii) in the case of substitution, two years from the related Closing Date.




	(b)               Any number of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans may be substituted for any number of Deleted Mortgage Loans and a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan may be
	substituted for a defective Mortgage Loan that is itself a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, in each case subject to the limitations described in the next sentence.  A Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan substituted for a Deleted Mortgage Loan pursuant to the
	terms of this Agreement must, on the date of such substitution, (i) have an outstanding principal balance (or in the case of a substitution of more than one mortgage loan for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, an aggregate principal balance), after application of all scheduled
	payments of principal and interest due during or prior to the month of substitution, not in excess of, and not more than 5.00% less than, the outstanding principal balance of the Deleted Mortgage Loan as of the Due Date in the calendar month during which the
	substitution occurs, (ii) have a Mortgage Rate not less than (and not more than one percentage point in excess of) the Mortgage Rate of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (iii) if the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, have a Maximum
	Mortgage Rate not greater than the Maximum Mortgage Rate on the Deleted Mortgage Loan and have a Minimum Mortgage Rate not less than the Minimum Mortgage Rate of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (iv) if the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage
	Loan, have a Gross Margin equal to or greater than the Gross Margin of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (v) if the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, have a next Adjustment Date not more than two months later than the next Adjustment
	Date on the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (vi) have a remaining term to maturity not greater than (and not more than one year less than) that of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (vii) be current (with no contractual delinquencies outstanding) as of the date of substitution,
	(viii) have a Loan-to-Value Ratio as of the date of substitution equal to or lower than the Loan-to-Value Ratio of the Deleted Mortgage Loan as of such date, (ix) have a risk grading determined by the Seller at least equal to the risk grading assigned on the Deleted
	Mortgage Loan, (x) have been underwritten or reunderwritten by the Seller in accordance with the same or, as determined by the Seller, more favorable, underwriting guidelines as the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (xi) with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans
	substituted for Deleted Mortgage Loans that are Group I Mortgage Loans, have had an original Principal Balance that conformed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits as of the date of its origination, (xii) be secured by the same property type as the Deleted
	Mortgage Loan, (xiii) have a lien priority equal to or superior to that of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, (xiv) [reserved], and (xv) conform to each representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement applicable to the Deleted Mortgage Loan.  In
	the event that one or more mortgage loans are substituted for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the amounts described in clause (i) hereof shall be determined on the basis of aggregate principal balances (applied separately for the Group I Mortgage Loans and Group
	II Mortgage Loans), the Mortgage Rates described in clauses (ii) through (v) hereof shall be satisfied for each such mortgage loan, the risk gradings described in clause (ix) hereof shall be satisfied as to each such mortgage loan, the terms described in clause (vi)
	hereof shall be determined on the basis of weighted average remaining term to maturity (provided that no such mortgage loan may have a remaining term to maturity longer than the Deleted Mortgage Loan), the Loan-to-Value Ratios described in clause (viii) hereof shall
	be satisfied as to each such mortgage loan and, except to the extent otherwise provided in this sentence, the representations and warranties described in clause (xv) hereof must be satisfied as to each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or in the aggregate, as the
	case may be.




	12




	 


	 



	(c)                In connection with the substitution of one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans on any date, the Seller
	shall pay to the Purchaser the Substitution Adjustment for such Deleted Mortgage Loans.




	(d)               Concurrently with each such substitution, the Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Purchaser or its
	designee the Mortgage File for each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan. Upon such substitution, the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, to the extent applicable (including, without limitation, the Seller’s
	obligations with respect to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 2.4 and Sections 2.3 and 3.3).  The Seller and the Purchaser shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule and the Prepayment Charge Schedule in a timely fashion to delete all
	repurchased Mortgage Loans and Deleted Mortgage Loans and add all Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans.




	(e)                The Seller shall pay any Repurchase Price or Substitution Adjustment by such method as is specified by the Purchaser in writing.




	13




	 



	(f)                 Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution are not owed by the Purchaser and will be
	retained by the Seller.  Any such payments received by the Purchaser or its transferee shall promptly be remitted by the Purchaser to the Seller.  For the month of substitution, distributions to the Purchaser will reflect the Monthly Payment due on such
	Deleted Mortgage Loan on or before the Due Date in the month of substitution, and the Seller shall thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts subsequently received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan.  Any such payments received by the Seller on such
	Deleted Mortgage Loan on or before the Due Date in the month of substitution shall promptly be remitted by the Seller to the Purchaser or its transferee.




	(g)                Upon receipt by the Purchaser of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Adjustment, as applicable, and (in the case of a substitution for a Mortgage
	Loan pursuant to this Section 2.4 or Section 3.3) upon receipt by the Purchaser of such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the Purchaser title to any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, the Purchaser
	shall release to the Seller the Mortgage File for the repurchased Mortgage Loan or the Deleted Mortgage Loan, as applicable, and shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the
	Seller title to such Mortgage Loan.




	(h)                The Seller shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any repurchase or substitution by the Seller made pursuant to this Section 2.4 or
	Section 3.3.




	(i)                  It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Seller set forth in this Section 2.4 constitute the sole remedies available to
	the Purchaser or its transferee respecting the Seller’s failure to include in the Mortgage File for a Mortgage Loan sold by the Seller the documents required to be included therein.



	 



	ARTICLE 3.


	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

	THE SELLER CONCERNING THE MORTGAGE LOANS;

	REPURCHASE OR SUBSTITUTION OF MORTGAGE LOANS




	Section 3.1.          Seller Representations and Warranties Concerning the Mortgage Loans




	The Seller hereby represents and warrants to and covenants to and agrees with the Purchaser that, as to each Mortgage Loan sold by the Seller hereunder, as of the related Cut-off Date unless otherwise indicated, subject in all cases (including,
	without limitation, clauses (xxxv) and (xlvi) to such exceptions, if any, as are set forth on Schedule III to the related Term Sheet:




	(i)                        The information set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to each Mortgage Loan is true and
	correct in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date, unless another date is set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule;




	14




	 



	(ii)                      [reserved];




	(iii)                     Each Mortgage is a valid and enforceable first or second lien on the Mortgaged Property, including all improvements
	thereon, subject only to (a) the lien of non-delinquent current real property taxes and assessments, (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record as of the date of recording of such Mortgage, such exceptions
	appearing of record being acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally or specifically reflected in the appraisal made in connection with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan and which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security
	intended to be provided by such Mortgage, (c) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage and (d) in the case of a second lien, only to a
	first lien on such Mortgaged Property;




	(iv)                    Immediately prior to the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, the Seller had good title to, and was the sole legal
	and beneficial owner of, each Mortgage Loan, free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or security interest and has full right and authority, subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement with, any other party to sell and assign the same.  The
	form of endorsement of each Mortgage Note satisfied the requirement, if any, of endorsement in order to transfer all right, title and interest of the party so endorsing, as noteholder or assignee thereof, in and to that Mortgage Note; and each Assignment to be
	delivered hereunder is in recordable form and is sufficient to effect the assignment of and to transfer to the assignee thereunder the benefits of the assignor, as mortgagee or assignee thereof, under each Mortgage to which that Assignment relates;




	(v)                      There is no delinquent tax or assessment lien against any Mortgaged Property;




	(vi)                    There is no valid offset, defense or counterclaim to any Mortgage Note (including any obligation of the Mortgagor to pay the
	unpaid principal of or interest on such Mortgage Note) or the Mortgage, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in
	part, or subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto;




	(vii)                   There are no mechanics’ liens or claims for work, labor or material affecting any Mortgaged Property which are or may be a lien
	prior to, or equal with, the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are insured against by the title insurance policy referred to in (xi) below;




	(viii)                 Each Mortgaged Property is free of material damage and is at least in average repair;




	15




	 


	 



	(ix)                    Each Mortgage Loan at origination complied in all material respects with applicable local, state and federal laws, including,
	without limitation, predatory and abusive lending, usury, equal credit opportunity, real estate settlement procedures, truth-in-lending and disclosure laws, and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation the receipt of interest
	does not involve the violation of any such laws;




	(x)                      Neither the Seller nor any prior holder of any Mortgage has modified the Mortgage in any material respect, satisfied,
	canceled or subordinated such Mortgage in whole or in part; released the related Mortgaged Property in whole or in part from the lien of such Mortgage; or executed any instrument of release, cancellation, modification or satisfaction with respect thereto (except that
	a Mortgage Loan may have been modified by a written instrument signed by the Seller or a prior holder of the Mortgage Loan which has been recorded, if necessary, to protect the interests of the Seller and the Purchaser and which has been delivered to the Purchaser or
	any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser as part of the Mortgage File, and the terms of which are reflected in the Mortgage Loan Schedule);




	(xi)                    A lender’s policy of title insurance together with a condominium endorsement and extended coverage endorsement, if
	applicable, and, with respect to each Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, an adjustable rate mortgage endorsement in an amount at least equal to the balance of the Mortgage Loan as of the Cut-off Date or a commitment (binder) to issue the same was effective on the date of
	the origination of each Mortgage Loan, each such policy is valid and remains in full force and effect, the transfer of the related Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser and the Trustee does not affect the validity or enforceability of such policy and each such policy was
	issued by a title insurer qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located and acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and in a form acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac on the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan, which
	policy insures the Seller and successor owners of indebtedness secured by the insured Mortgage, as to the first or second, as the case may be, priority lien of the Mortgage; no claims have been made under such mortgage title insurance policy and no prior holder of
	the related Mortgage, including the Seller, has done, by act or omission, anything which would impair the coverage of such mortgage title insurance policy;




	(xii)                   Each Mortgage Loan was originated by, or generated on behalf of, the Seller, or originated by a savings and loan association, savings
	bank, commercial bank, credit union, insurance company or similar institution which is supervised and examined by a federal or state authority, or by a mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to Sections 203 and 211 of the
	National Housing Act;




	(xiii)                 With respect to each Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, on each Adjustment Date, the Mortgage Rate will be adjusted to equal the Index plus the Gross
	Margin, rounded to the nearest or highest 0.125%, subject to the Periodic Rate Cap, the Maximum Mortgage Rate and the Minimum Mortgage Rate.  The related Mortgage Note is payable on the first day of each month in self-amortizing monthly installments of principal
	and interest (unless such Mortgage Loan is a mortgage loan that requires the payment of interest only with respect to some or all of the related monthly payments as indicated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule), with interest payable in arrears, and requires a Monthly
	Payment which is sufficient to fully amortize the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan over its remaining term and to pay interest at the applicable Mortgage Rate.  No Mortgage Loan is subject to negative amortization.  All rate adjustments
	have been performed in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Note or subsequent modifications, if any;




	16




	 


	 



	(xiv)                 All of the improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the Value of the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the boundaries and
	building restriction lines of such property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged Property;




	(xv)                  All inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property and,
	with respect to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not limited to certificates of occupancy, have been made or obtained from the appropriate authorities and the Mortgaged Property is lawfully occupied under applicable law;




	(xvi)                 All parties which have had any interest in the Mortgage, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are (or, during the period in which
	they held and disposed of such interest, were) in compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of the laws of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located;




	(xvii)               The Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage are genuine, and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Mortgagor enforceable against the Mortgagor
	by the mortgagee or its representative in accordance with its terms, except only as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by
	law.  To the best of the Seller’s knowledge, all parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage had full legal capacity to execute all Mortgage Loan documents and to convey the estate purported to be conveyed by the Mortgage and each Mortgage Note and
	Mortgage have been duly and validly executed by such parties;




	(xviii)              The proceeds of each Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed, there is no requirement for future advances thereunder and any and all requirements as to completion
	of any on-site or off-site improvements and as to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with.  All costs, fees and expenses incurred in making, closing or recording the Mortgage Loans were paid;




	(xix)                 The related Mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the
	realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of the security, including, (i) in the case of a Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee’s sale, and (ii) otherwise by judicial foreclosure.  There is no homestead or other exemption
	available to the Mortgagor which would interfere with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee’s sale or the right to foreclose the Mortgage;




	17




	 


	 



	(xx)                  With respect to each Mortgage constituting a deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been properly
	designated and currently so serves and is named in such Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the Purchaser to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee’s sale after default by the Mortgagor;




	(xxi)                 There exist no deficiencies with respect to escrow deposits and payments, if such are required, for which customary arrangements for repayment
	thereof have not been made, and no escrow deposits or payments of other charges or payments due the Seller have been capitalized under the Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note;




	(xxii)               The origination, underwriting and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been in all material respects legal, proper,
	prudent and customary in the subprime mortgage servicing business.  Each Mortgage Loan is currently being serviced by Washington Mutual Bank;




	(xxiii)              There is no pledged account or other security other than real estate securing the Mortgagor’s obligations;




	(xxiv)             No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, or other contingent interest feature;




	(xxv)               [reserved];




	(xxvi)             The improvements upon each Mortgaged Property are covered by a valid and existing hazard insurance policy with a generally acceptable carrier that provides for fire
	extended coverage and coverage of such other hazards as are customarily covered by hazard insurance policies with extended coverage in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located representing coverage not less than the lesser of the outstanding principal balance
	of the related Mortgage Loan or the minimum amount required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis.  All individual insurance policies and flood policies referred to in this clause (xxvi) and in clause (xxvii) below contain a standard
	mortgagee clause naming the Seller or the original mortgagee, and its successors in interest, as mortgagee, and the Seller has received no notice that any premiums due and payable thereon have not been paid; the Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain
	all such insurance, including flood insurance, at the Mortgagor’s cost and expense, and upon the Mortgagor’s failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor’s cost and expense and to
	seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor;




	(xxvii)            If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as subject to special flood hazards, a flood insurance
	policy in a form meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the Flood Insurance Administration is in effect with respect to such Mortgaged Property with a generally acceptable carrier in an amount representing coverage not less than the least of (A) the
	original outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (B) the minimum amount required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis or (C) the maximum amount of insurance that is available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
	1973;




	18




	 


	 



	(xxviii)          There is no default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note; and neither the Seller nor any other entity involved in
	originating or servicing the Mortgage Loan has waived any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration;




	(xxix)             Each Mortgaged Property is improved by a one- to four-family residential dwelling, including condominium units and dwelling units in planned unit developments, which does
	not constitute property other than real property under state law;




	(xxx)               There is no obligation on the part of the Seller or any other party under the terms of the Mortgage or related Mortgage Note to make payments in addition to
	those made by the Mortgagor;




	(xxxi)             Any future advances made prior to the Cut-off Date have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured by the Mortgage, and the secured principal amount,
	as consolidated, bears a single interest rate and single repayment term reflected on the related Mortgage Loan Schedule.  The consolidated principal amount does not exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan;




	(xxxii)            Each Mortgage Loan was underwritten in accordance with the Underwriting Standards as described in the Prospectus Supplement as applicable to its credit grade in all material
	respects;




	(xxxiii)          Each appraisal of a Mortgage Loan that was used to determine the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property was conducted generally in accordance with the Underwriting Standards,
	and included an assessment by the appraiser of the fair market value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the appraisal.  The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the applicable Mortgaged Property;




	(xxxiv)          None of the Mortgage Loans is a graduated payment Mortgage Loan, nor is any Mortgage Loan subject to a temporary buydown or similar arrangement;




	(xxxv)           Except as set forth on Schedule III to the related Term Sheet, there are no Mortgage Loans with respect to which the monthly payment due thereon in March, 2006 had not been made,
	none of the Mortgage Loans has been contractually delinquent for more than 30 days more than twice during the preceding twelve months and, no Mortgage Loan has ever experienced a delinquency of 60 or more days since the origination thereof;




	19




	 


	 



	(xxxvi)          Each Mortgage contains a provision that is, to the extent not prohibited by federal or state law, enforceable for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the
	Mortgage Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property is sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the mortgagee thereunder;




	(xxxvii)        No misrepresentation, negligence, fraud or similar occurrence with respect to a Mortgage Loan has taken place on the part of any person, including, without limitation, the Mortgagor, any appraiser,
	any builder or developer, or any other party involved in the origination of the Mortgage Loan or in the application of any insurance in relation to such Mortgage Loan;




	(xxxviii)       Each Mortgage Loan constitutes a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code;




	(xxxix)          The information set forth in the Prepayment Charge Schedule is complete, true and correct in all material respects at the date or dates respecting which such information is furnished and
	each Prepayment Charge is permissible and enforceable in accordance with its terms under applicable law upon the Mortgagor’s voluntary Principal Prepayment (except to the extent that:  (1) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
	insolvency, moratorium, receivership and other similar laws relating to creditors’ rights generally; or (2) the collectability thereof may be limited due to acceleration in connection with a foreclosure or other involuntary prepayment).  No Mortgage Loan
	originated before October 1, 2002 has a Prepayment Charge for a term in excess of five years from the date of its origination and no Mortgage Loan originated on or after October 1, 2002 has a prepayment charge for a term in excess of three years from the
	date of its origination;




	(xl)                    The Loan-to-Value Ratio for each Mortgage Loan was no greater than 100% at the time of origination;




	(xli)                   The first date on which each Mortgagor must make a payment on the related Mortgage Note is no later than 60 days from the date of this
	Agreement;




	(xlii)                 Except as set forth on Schedule III to the related Term Sheet, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgagor shall not fail or has not
	failed to make the first monthly payment due under the terms of the Mortgage Loan by the second succeeding Due Date after the Due Date on which such monthly payment was due;




	(xliii)                The transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Mortgage Notes and the Mortgages by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement are not subject to the bulk
	transfer or any similar statutory provisions in effect in any relevant jurisdiction, except any as may have been complied with;




	20




	 


	 



	(xliv)               There are no defaults in complying with the terms of the Mortgage, and either (1) any taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water, sewer and
	municipal charges or ground rents which previously became due and owing have been paid, or (2) an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid and which has been assessed but is not yet due and
	payable.  Except for payments in the nature of escrow payments, including without limitation, taxes and insurance payments, the Seller has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor,
	directly or indirectly, for the payment of any amount required by the Mortgage Note, except for interest accruing from the date of the Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the Mortgage proceeds, whichever is greater, to the day which precedes by one month the Due
	Date of the first installment of principal and interest;




	(xlv)                 There is no proceeding pending or threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of the Mortgaged Property or the taking by eminent domain of
	any Mortgaged Property;




	(xlvi)               No Mortgage Loan is subject to the requirements of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, as amended, or is a “high cost” or
	“predatory” loan under any state or local law or regulation applicable to the originator of such Mortgage Loan or which would result in liability to the purchaser or assignee of such Mortgage Loan under any predatory or abusive lending law.  In the
	event that Financial Security Assurance, Inc. becomes a NIMS Insurer, no Mortgage Loan is a “covered” loan under the laws of the states of California, Colorado or Ohio;




	(xlvii)              No proceeds from any Mortgage Loans were used to finance single-premium credit insurance policies.  No borrower was required to purchase any credit life,
	disability, accident or health insurance product as a condition of obtaining the extension of credit.  No borrower obtained a prepaid single-premium credit life, disability, accident or health insurance policy in connection with the origination of the Mortgage
	Loan;




	(xlviii)            The Seller did not select the Mortgage Loans with the intent to adversely affect the interests of the Purchaser;




	(xlix)               The Seller has not received any notice that any Mortgagor has filed for any bankruptcy or similar legal protection since the date of the origination of such
	Mortgage Loan.  Prior to the date of the origination of any Mortgage Loan, the Seller did not receive any notice that any Mortgagor has filed for bankruptcy or similar legal protection except as permitted under the Underwriting Guidelines;




	(l)                        No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High-Cost Home Loan” as defined in the Georgia Fair Lending
	Act, as amended (the “Georgia Act”), and no Mortgage Loan that was originated on or after October 1, 2002 and before March 7, 2003, is secured by a Mortgaged Property located in the State of Georgia;




	21




	 


	 



	(li)                      No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Home Loan” as defined in the Kentucky high-cost loan statute
	effective June 24, 2003 (Ky. Rev. Stat. Section 360.100);




	(lii)                     No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Home Loan” as defined in the New Jersey Home Ownership Act
	effective November 27, 2003 (N.J.S.A. 46; 10B-22 et seq.);




	(liii)                   No Group I Mortgage Loan is a subsection 10 mortgage under the Oklahoma Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act;




	(liv)                   No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High-Cost Home Loan” as defined in New York Banking Law 6-1;




	(lv)                    No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Home Loan” as defined in the Arkansas Home Loan Protection Act effective
	July 16, 2003 (Act 1340 of 2003);




	(lvi)                   No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High-Cost Home Loan” as defined in the New Mexico Home Loan Protection Act effective
	January 1, 2004 (N.M. Stat. Am. §§ 58-21A-1 et seq.);




	(lvii)                 [reserved];




	(lviii)                Each Group I Mortgage Loan was originated in compliance with the following anti-predatory lending guidelines:




	a.         Each Group I Mortgage Loan satisfies the eligibility for purchase requirements and was originated in compliance with Lender Letter # LL03-00 dated April 11, 2000 for Fannie Mae Sellers (the
	“Lender Letter”);




	b.         No borrower was encouraged or required by the Seller to select a Group I Mortgage Loan product offered by the Group I Mortgage Loan’s originator which is a higher cost product designed for
	less creditworthy borrowers, unless at the time of the Group I Mortgage Loan’s origination, such borrower did not qualify taking into account credit history and debt-to-income ratios for a lower-cost credit product then offered by the Group I Mortgage
	Loan’s originator or any affiliate of the Group I Mortgage Loan’s originator;




	c.         The methodology used in underwriting the extension of credit for each Group I Mortgage Loan employs objective mathematical principles which relate the borrower’s income, assets and liabilities
	to the proposed payment and such underwriting methodology does not rely on the extent of the borrower’s equity in the collateral as the principal determining factor in approving such credit extension.  Such underwriting methodology provided reasonable
	assurance that at the time of origination (application/approval) the borrower had a reasonable ability to make timely payments on the Group I Mortgage Loan;




	22




	 


	 



	d.         With respect to any Group I Mortgage Loan that contains a provision permitting imposition of a premium upon a prepayment prior to maturity, (i) the Seller’s pricing methods include mortgage
	loans with and without prepayment premiums; borrowers selecting Group I Mortgage Loans which include such prepayment premiums receive a monetary benefit, including but not limited to a rate or fee reduction, in exchange for selecting a Group I Mortgage Loan with a
	prepayment premium, (ii) prior to the Group I Mortgage Loan’s origination, the borrower had the opportunity to choose between an array of mortgage loan products which included mortgage loan products with prepayment premiums and mortgage loan products that did
	not require payment of such a premium, (iii) the prepayment premium is disclosed to the borrower in the loan documents pursuant to applicable state and federal law, and (iv) notwithstanding any state or federal law to the contrary, the Servicer shall not impose such
	prepayment premium in any instance when the mortgage debt is accelerated as the result of the borrower’s default in making the loan payments;




	e.         All points and fees related to each Group I Mortgage Loan were disclosed in writing to the borrower in accordance with applicable state and federal law.  Except in the case of a Group I
	Mortgage Loan in an original principal amount of less than $60,000 which would have resulted in an unprofitable origination, no borrower was charged “points and fees” (whether or not financed) in an amount greater than 5% of the principal amount of such
	loan, such 5% limitation calculated in accordance with the Lender Letter;




	f.          All fees and charges (including finance charges) and whether or not financed, assessed, collected or to be collected in connection with the origination and servicing of each Group I Mortgage
	Loan have been disclosed in writing to the borrower in accordance with applicable state and federal law and regulation;




	(lix)             No Group I Mortgage Loan had a principal balance at origination in excess of Fannie Mae’s conforming loan balance limitations for single family loans set forth in
	the Fannie Mae Charter Act and the Fannie Mae Selling Guide in effect at the time of such Group I Mortgage Loan's origination;




	(lx)              With respect to each Group I Mortgage Loan, information regarding the borrower credit file related to such Mortgage Loan has been furnished to credit reporting
	agencies in compliance with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the applicable implementing regulations;




	(lxi)             No Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Loan” or “Covered Loan” (as such terms are defined in the Standard & Poor’s LEVELS® Glossary in
	effect on the  related Closing Date, applicable portions of which are attached hereto as Schedule II to the Term Sheet) and no Mortgage Loan originated on or after October 1, 2002 through March 6, 2003 is governed by the Georgia Act;




	(lxii)           No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Home Mortgage Loan” as defined in the Massachusetts Predatory Home Loan Practices Act effective November 7, 2004 (Mass.
	Ann. Laws ch. 183C);




	23




	 


	 



	(lxiii)          No Group I Mortgage Loan is a “High Cost Home Loan” as defined in the Indiana Home Loan Practices Act effective January 1, 2005 (Ind. Code Ann.
	§§ 24-9-1 through 24-9-9);




	(lxiv)         With respect to any Group I Mortgage Loan originated on or after August 1, 2004, neither the related Mortgage nor the related Mortgage Note requires the Mortgagor to submit to arbitration to
	resolve any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Mortgage Loan transaction; and




	(lxv)           With respect to any second lien mortgage loan that is a Group I Mortgage Loan:  (a) such Mortgage Loan is on a one- to four-family residence that is the principal residence of
	the borrower; (b) such Mortgage Loan does not have an original principal balance that exceeds one-half of the Freddie Mac one-unit limitation for first lien mortgage loans, or $208,500 (in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii or Virgin Islands: $312,750), without regard to the
	number of units; and (c) the original principal balance of the related first lien mortgage loan plus the original principal balance of any subordinate lien mortgage loans relating to the same Mortgaged Property does not exceed the applicable Freddie Mac loan limit
	for first lien mortgage loans for that property type on the related Closing Date.



	 



	Section 3.2.          Additional Seller Representations and Warranties




	The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser as of each Closing Date on which the Seller sells Mortgage Loans hereunder, and with respect to such Mortgage Loans, as of such Closing Date:




	(i)                  The Seller is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.




	(ii)                The Seller has all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now being conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing in the states where
	the Mortgaged Properties are located if the laws of such states require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of the type conducted by the Seller and to the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of each Mortgage Loan.  The Seller has
	the corporate power and authority to hold each Mortgage Loan, to sell each Mortgage Loan, to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement, the Term Sheet, the Confidential Pricing Supplement and all documents and instruments executed and delivered pursuant hereto
	and to perform its obligations in accordance therewith.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Seller and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the repurchase obligations herein
	contained, have been duly and validly authorized.  This Agreement, the Term Sheet, the Confidential Pricing Supplement and all other documents and instruments contemplated hereby to which the Seller is a party, in each case assuming due authorization, execution
	and delivery by the Purchaser, evidence the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Seller, subject as to enforceability, (i) to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, and other laws of general
	applicability relating to or affecting creditor’s rights, and (ii) to general principles of equity, whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law.  All requisite corporate action has been taken by the Seller to make this Agreement
	valid and binding upon the Seller in accordance with its terms.




	24




	 


	 



	(iii)               No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court or governmental agency or body relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
	transfer of legal title to the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, is required as to the Seller or, if required, such consent, approval, authorization, or order has been or will, prior to the applicable Closing Date, be obtained, except for any recordation of Mortgages
	or assignments of Mortgages or filing of UCC financing statements or amendments thereto to or for the benefit of the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.




	(iv)              The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation the transfer and assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser
	pursuant to this Agreement and the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, are in the ordinary course of business of the Seller and will not (i) result in the breach of any term or provision of the certificate of
	incorporation or by-laws of the Seller, (ii) result in the breach of any term or provision of, or conflict with or constitute a default under, or result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any material agreement, indenture, loan or credit agreement or
	other instrument to which the Seller or its property is subject or (iii) result in the violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, or decree to which the Seller or its property is subject.




	(v)                There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best of the Seller’s knowledge, threatened, against the Seller which, either
	in any one instance or in the aggregate, is likely, in the Seller’s judgment, to result, in any material impairment of the right or ability of the Seller to carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or which would draw into question the validity of
	this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, or of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the Seller contemplated herein or therein, or which would be likely to impair materially the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations hereunder
	or thereunder.




	(vi)              The Seller is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“

	HUD

	”) approved mortgagee pursuant to Section 203 of the National Housing

	(vii)             The Seller is not in violation of, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and its performance and compliance with the terms of this Agreement will
	not constitute a violation with respect to, any order or decree of any court or any order or regulation of any federal, state, municipal or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Seller or its assets, which violation might have consequences that would
	materially and adversely affect the condition, financial or otherwise, or the operations, of the Seller or its assets or might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the performance of its obligations and duties hereunder.

	Section 3.3.          Repurchases and Substitutions in the Event of Breach of Seller Representations and Warranties

	(b)               Upon discovery by the Seller or the Purchaser of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 that materially and adversely
	affects the value of any Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Purchaser in such Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other and the NIMS Insurer. Any breach of the representation set forth in the last sentence of
	clause (xxxix), clause (xlvi), the first sentence (xlvii), clause (lxi) and clause (lxiv) of Section 3.1 shall be deemed to materially and adversely affect the value of the related Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Purchaser in the related Mortgage Loan. Within
	90 days of its discovery of breach or its receipt of notice of breach from the Purchaser or its designee, the Seller shall repurchase from the Purchaser or its transferee the affected Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans or any property acquired in respect thereof, or
	substitute one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans therefor, unless it has cured such breach in all material respects. Any such repurchase or substitution shall be made in the manner and within the time limits set forth in Section 2.4. If such breach would
	cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a “qualified mortgage” (as defined in the Code), then notwithstanding the previous sentence, the repurchase or substitution must occur within the sooner of (i) 90 days from the date the defect was discovered by the
	Seller, the Purchaser or any other party to the related Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (ii) in the case of substitution, two years from the related Closing Date.




	(c)                Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, promptly upon the earlier of discovery by the Seller or receipt of notice by the Seller of the breach of
	any representation or warranty of the Seller set forth in Section 3.1(i) if such breach relates to any field on the Mortgage Loan Schedule which identifies any Prepayment Charge or Section 3.1(xxxix), in each case, which materially and adversely affects the
	interests of the Purchaser or its designee to any Prepayment Charge and such Prepayment Charge has been triggered pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Note, the Seller shall pay the amount of the scheduled Prepayment Charge (net of any amount previously
	collected by or paid to the Purchaser or the Trustee in respect of such Prepayment Charge), and the Seller shall have no obligation to repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan.  Payments by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this paragraph shall be
	made within two Business Days of the earlier of discovery by the Seller or receipt of notice by the Seller of the breach of the related representation or warranty. 




	26




	 



	(d)               It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Seller set forth in this Section 3.3 constitute the sole remedies available to the Purchaser or its
	transferee respecting a breach of the representations and warranties by the Seller set forth in Section 3.1.




	(e)                In addition to such cure, repurchase or substitution obligation, the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and hold it harmless against any losses,
	damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting from the defense of any claim against the Purchaser by a third party resulting from a breach of the representations and

	become subject, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of any material fact contained in the information

	to such Mortgage Loans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be prohibited from:




	(i)                  advertising its availability for handling refinancing of mortgage loans if the Mortgage Loans are not specifically targeted;

	affiliates owns or services;




	(iii)               promoting terms available for refinancing by sending letters or promotional material to the mortgagors of all the mortgage loans of a specific type (e.g.,
	conventional fixed-rate or conventional adjustable-rate) that the Seller or its affiliates owns or services;




	(iv)              promoting terms available for refinancing by sending letters or promotional material to the mortgagors of all the mortgage loans that fall within specific interest
	rate ranges that the Seller or its affiliates owns or services;

	available; or




	(vii)             engaging in any action to solicit the refinancing of any Mortgage Loan to the extent such action would be permitted under the Fannie Mae Selling Guide or the Fannie Mae
	Servicing Guide.




	In no event shall the Seller treat mortgage loans that it holds in its own portfolio and the Mortgage Loans as separate classes of mortgages for purposes of advertising the availability of refinancing terms.




	Section 7.13.      Attorneys’ Fees




	If either party retains an attorney to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees from the other party, including, without limitation, fees incurred in arbitration and

	Section 7.14.      Security Interest




	(a)    The parties hereto intend that each transfer of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Term Sheet constitute a sale by the Seller to the Purchaser of such Mortgage Loan, including for accounting
	purposes, and not a secured borrowing.  It is, further, not the intention of the parties that any such transfer be deemed the grant of a security interest in any Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of the Seller.
	However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, any Mortgage Loan is held to be the property of the Seller, or if for any other reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest in any Mortgage Loan, then (a) this Agreement
	shall constitute a security agreement; and (b) the transfer provided for in this Agreement and the applicable Term Sheet shall be deemed to be a grant by the Seller to the Purchaser of, and the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser, to secure all of the
	Seller’s obligations hereunder, a security interest in all of the Seller’s right, title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under: (i) the Mortgage Loans listed on the Mortgage Loan Schedule to each Term Sheet; (ii) all
	accounts, chattel paper, deposit accounts, documents, general intangibles, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, and other minerals, consisting of, arising from, or relating to, any of the foregoing;
	and (iii) all proceeds of the foregoing.  The Purchaser shall have all of the rights of a secured party under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code.




	(b)   The Seller shall take or cause to be taken such actions and execute such documents, including without limitation the filing of any financing statements, continuation statements, and amendments to financing statements, as are
	necessary to perfect the Purchaser’s interests in each Mortgage Loan.  The Seller shall file such financing statements, continuation statements, and amendments on a timely basis.




	34




	 


	 



	(c)    No later than ten (10) days following each Closing Date, the Seller shall file in the applicable jurisdictions such UCC financing statements covering the Mortgage Loans sold by the Seller on such Closing Date as are necessary
	to perfect the Purchaser’s interests in such Mortgage Loans.




	Section 7.15.      Covenant Not to Place Purchaser or Trust Into Bankruptcy




	The Seller covenants that it shall not, until at least one year and one day after all securities issued by any Trust to which the Purchaser has transferred Mortgage Loans have been paid in full, take any action to file an involuntary bankruptcy
	petition against the Purchaser or any Trust.
