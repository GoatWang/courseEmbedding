TekModo Industries Inc. Auditor Raises 'Going Concern' Doubt
May 1 17
TekModo Industries Inc. filed its Annual on May 01, 2017 for the period ending Dec 31, 2016. In this report its auditor, Meyers Norris Penny LLP - MNP LLP, gave an unqualified opinion expressing doubt that the company can continue as a going concern.


TekModo Industries Inc. Announces Executive Changes
Feb 14 17
TekModo Industries Inc. has made the decision to consolidate all of the company activities in Elkhart, Indiana including administration, accounting and corporate finance. As part of this initiative, Jake Vogel has been appointed Executive Chairman and John Proust has stepped down as Chairman and will remain on the board as Executive Director. Marc LaCounte, a founding Director and former Business Development Officer, has been appointed as President.  Mr. LaCounte has a thorough understanding of the TekModo business operations, suppliers, customers and employees. Mary Wetzel has resigned as President and director, for personal reasons, but the company looks forward to working with her in the role of consultant, as the company potentially diversifies into the automotive manufacturing industry at some point in the future. Robert Cross, Gordon Keep and Morris Klid have resigned as directors, and Jack Khorchidian as a Director and COO as the company transitions into the USA. Bill Fenech has resigned as a Director and will be taking on a new role as an Elkhart based Strategic Advisor joining with existing Strategic Advisor Jeff Schwartz. Mr.  Vogel is the Chief Executive Officer of Boat Holdings, LLC. Prior to his position at Boat Holdings, Mr.  Vogel spent two years in investment banking, focused primarily on mergers and acquisitions, and almost seven years as a business services consultant with Accenture, where his clients included leading international companies and government agencies such as CN Rail, NASA, Johnson Controls, Corning and PepsiCo. Mr.  LaCounte is a co-founder of TekModo LLC.  He has extensive experience in developing and marketing new technologies. Mr. LaCounte was the Senior Business Unit Manager of Specialty Markets for Webasto Thermosystems. At Webasto, he was responsible for the strategy, product development, and commercial conversion of new technologies, where he managed all aspects of the military, industrial/commercial, marine, cargo, and RV market groups.

TekModo Industries Inc., which manufactures, assembles and distributes a wide range of advanced composite material to the RV, marine and other related industries, has announced several updates to its current operations and business plan going forward, which includes consolidating all of the company activities in Elkhart, Ind., including administration, accounting and corporate finance.
Changes, and other announcements, included: a number of upper management positions; an equipment failure that caused seven weeks of production down time (production has since resumed); a GRP gel coat manufacturing line that is expected to be completed in March; multiple activated carbon orders that have been received; and the need for immediate financing.
According to a release, at the end of 2016 the company experienced an unexpected manufacturing equipment failure, which resulted in approximately seven weeks of production down time and substantially reduced sales and cash flow for the months of January and February 2017. The equipment is being repaired and upgraded and the manufacturing schedule is being resumed.
As a result of the January shutdown and the associated interruption to cash flow, the company requires an immediate equity financing to maintain its current business operations and complete the GRP commercialization. Discussions are being held with various parties and progress will be reported in a future news release. The amount and pricing is yet to be determined.
In addition to several existing manufacturing and assembly lines, the construction of the new GRP gel coat manufacturing line is expected to be completed in March and will initially allow the company to produce commercial samples of SpectraLite exterior skin replacement, for initial select customers. TekModo intends to commercially launch its SpectraLite product in July 2017.
As part of the decision to consolidate all of the company activities in Elkhart — a timetable was not provided — Jake Vogel has been appointed executive chairman of the company. John Proust has stepped down as chairman and will remain on the board as executive director. Marc LaCounte, a founding director and former business development officer, has been appointed president.
“I am pleased to assume the leadership role of president of TekModo and strengthen our business efforts moving forward,” stated LaCounte. “I am proud to be leading our team and working with the caliber of people that are associated with our business. If we are able to successfully finance our operations, this opportunity will allow me to focus my energy and realize my true passion on building this business, executing our vision, and continuing to bring truly disruptive technologies into the marketplace. The opportunity is present; the time is now.”
Vogel is the chief executive officer of Boat Holdings LLC, the manufacturer and owner of several industry-leading recreational boat brands including Bennington, Godfrey, Hurricane and Rinker. Together these brands represent roughly 30% of the market share in the large and growing pontoon boat segment, and 45% in the deck boat segment.
“I am very positive about the direction of the business and moving its leadership more to Elkhart where the core of its operations and customers reside,” Vogel stated. “The Elkhart team has the necessary knowledge, experience and passion to best manage the business and make decisions. As executive chairman and the largest shareholder, I believe in the company’s ability to bring value to its customers and the team’s ability to execute this plan.”
Former Thor Industries Inc. executive Bill Fenech, who is also a co-founder of Grand Design Recreational Vehicles, has resigned as a director and will be taking on a new role as an Elkhart-based strategic advisor joining with existing Strategic Advisor Jeff Schwartz. Together they will focus on new product development applications, customer relationships and overall business operations.
“I recently invested in TekModo through an investment group that I am part of. The reasons for the investment were the products that they were producing at the time and the products that were in the pipeline for production and/or distribution. I remain excited about these products and feel they could be the next generation of mainstream products for the industries they are targeting,” Fenech stated.
Mary Wetzel has resigned as president and director for personal reasons, but she will consult with the company as TekModo potentially diversifies into the automotive manufacturing industry at some point in the future. In addition, Robert Cross, Gordon Keep and Morris Klid have resigned as directors, and Jack Khorchidian as a director and COO, as the company transitions into the U.S.A.
The reconstituted board of TekModo now consists of Vogel as its executive chairman, Proust as its executive director, LaCounte, and Murray Flanigan. The officers of the company are LaCounte (president), Vince Boon (CFO) and Eileen Au (corporate secretary).

The combination of TekModo and CarbonOne created a fully integrated advanced materials company that is dedicated to producing high-quality, innovative materials and using leading-edge manufacturing processes.

TekModo Industries draws on the unique skills and insight of executives and directors from both companies, creating a strong management and advisory team with a broad skill set and an entrepreneurial culture.
TekModo Industries trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol “TEK”.

(TSX VENTURE:TEK) ("TekModo" or the "Company") is providing an update on its current operations and business plan going forward.Highlights- Jake Vogel becomes Executive Chairman.- Marc LaCounte assumes the role of President.- Bill Fenech joins Jeff Schwartz as an Elkhart based Strategic Advisor.- Equipment failure causes seven weeks of production down time. Production is now resuming.- The GRP gel coat manufacturing line is expected to be completed in March 2017.- Multiple Activated Carbon orders received.- Need for immediate financing.TekModo manufactures, assembles and distributes a wide range of advanced composite material to the RV, trailer, panel van, box truck, shuttle bus and marine industries from its 50,000 square foot facility in Elkhart, Indiana. RV customers are demanding superior quality and manufacturers are confronting increasing warranty claims. TekModo products fulfill both consumer and manufacturer goals by replacing legacy wood construction with vastly superior advanced composite materials.Operational UpdateAt year end, the Company experienced an unexpected manufacturing equipment failure which resulted in approximately seven weeks of production down time and substantially reduced sales and cash flow for the months of January and February 2017. The equipment is being repaired and upgraded and the manufacturing schedule is being resumed.In addition to several existing manufacturing and assembly lines, the construction of the new GRP gel coat manufacturing line is expected to be completed in March and will initially allow the Company to produce commercial samples of SpectraLite™ exterior skin replacement, for initial select customers. TekModo intends to commercially launch its SpectraLite™ product in July 2017. SpectraLite™ is a highly engineered exterior wall panel to be produced in a continuous process, resulting in a high-gloss seamless panel with improved optics, reduced weight and extreme durability. After completion and subject to testing, this product, when integrated with the Company's proprietary substrate (secondary layer) material, Fortis, will be designed to provide the most advanced seamless sidewall skin system in the marketplace due to its appearance, quality and durability. Based on preliminary discussions with TekModo customers, demand for the patentable, disruptive SpectraLite™ is anticipated to be very strong.TekModo announced the delivery of its first shipment of distributed, pelletized activated carbon on December 8, 2016. Since then, the demand for this product has increased, and resulted in multiple orders.Business Plan Going Forward and FinancingThe business plan of the Company going forward will be to continue to grow the customer base and demand for the current manufactured, assembled, and distributed products while in parallel, focusing on the development of the GRP gel coat manufacturing line and the commercialization of the SpectraLite™ product. This will involve the completion of construction of the GRP manufacturing line, commissioning of the GRP line, and development and evaluation by potential customers of the SpectraLite™ product. The commercialization will be dependant on the quality of the product, the rate at which the product can be produced, and pricing enabling TekModo to achieve acceptable margins. Commercialization cannot be assured.As a result of the January shutdown and the associated interruption to cash flow, the Company requires an immediate equity financing to maintain its current business operations and complete the GRP commercialization. Discussions are being held with various parties and progress will be reported in a future news release. The amount and pricing is yet to be determined.Transition to Elkhart, Indiana and Associated Leadership Changes.TekModo has made the decision to consolidate all of the Company activities in Elkhart, Indiana including administration, accounting and corporate finance. As part of this initiative, Jake Vogel has been appointed Executive Chairman and John Proust has stepped down as Chairman and will remain on the board as Executive Director. Marc LaCounte, a founding Director and former Business Development Officer, has been appointed President.
