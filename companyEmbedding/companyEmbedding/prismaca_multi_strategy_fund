TORA releases Prism | Financial Industry & Algorithmic Trading News | Automated Trader
TORA releases PrismFirst Published 5th November 2014TORA releases Portfolio and Risk Management system.Risk ManagementPortfolio ManagementRobert Dykes, CEO,TORA"Hedge funds have, in the last few years, been demanding a true  front-to-back solution offering the best of breed functionality  coupled with a minimal IT footprint and an easy implementation."
San Francisco - TORA,
  the provider of technology and financial services, has released
  its Portfolio and Risk Management system (Prism).

"The TORA Portfolio and Risk Management products
  were developed for several of our TORA Compass customers who were
  looking for a complete solution", said Robert Dykes, CEO of TORA.
  "We've successfully deployed our Portfolio and Risk products to
  several large global multi-strategy funds, as well as new fund
  launches, and we're excited to introduce the product to the
  broader market today."

TORA's Portfolio and Risk Management system
  delivers real time profit and loss (PnL) coupled with a real time
  risk system offering VaR, risk scenarios and exposure bucketing.
  The system is multi asset covering all asset types including
  listed, OTC and fixed income instruments. The portfolio system
  contains all historical transaction information allowing users to
  look at PnL, exposure and risk over any time period.

"Hedge funds have, in the last few years, been
  demanding a true front-to-back solution offering the best of
  breed functionality coupled with a minimal IT footprint and an
  easy implementation", said Dykes. "What makes us different to
  other solutions is that every TORA product is built in-house with
  one development team, under one roof; building products that are
  integrated from the start."

All TORA's products are fully hosted to relieve
  the operation and technology burden on their clients and
  delivered as a turnkey solution.

"From a functional perspective, we focused our
  efforts on implementing the features that matter most to hedge
  funds while using cutting edge technologies"
said Oren Blonstein, Managing Director, Product
  Development, "This allowed us to
  develop an incredibly flexible yet real-time profit and loss
  system, fully integrated end-to-end e-locate and borrow
  management, a comprehensive risk system, automated reconciliation
  on trades, positions and cash movements as well as rebalancing
  and compliance."
