The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1. The Advisor has contractually agreed to waive 1.25% of the Fund’s management fee. This fee waiver will continue through at least October 31, 2017. Total net operating expenses including the expense cap and excluding dividends on short sales are Class A 1.82%, Class C 2.47%, and Class Z 1.47%.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity securities, such as common stocks, are subject to market, economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate.
Short Sales Risk. Short sales that are not made “against-the-box” (as defined under “Description of Principal Investments”) theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.
Hedging Risk. Although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful.
Market Risk. The Fund’s share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its portfolio securities. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
Portfolio Turnover Risk. High portfolio turnover will increase the Fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains.
Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.
Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss, cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise.
Non-U.S. Securities Risk. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers, particularly securities of emerging market issuers, involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, expropriation or political or economic instability).
Micro, Small and Mid-Cap Securities Risk. Investments in securities of companies with micro, small or medium capitalizations involve certain risks that may differ from, or be greater than, those for larger companies, such as higher volatility, lower trading volume, fewer business lines and lack of public information.
Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund. A non-diversified fund’s investment in fewer issuers may result in the fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund.
Management Risk. The Fund relies on Highland’s ability to achieve its investment objective. Highland may be incorrect in its assessment of the intrinsic value of companies whose securities the Fund holds, which may result in a decline in the value of Fund shares.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1 Total net operating expenses excluding dividends on short sales are Class A 2.04%, Class C 2.69%, and Class Z 1.69%.
2 Source: National Coalition on Health Care as of June 2011.
3 Includes AUM of affiliated advisers.
4 The “Advisory Group” referenced is comprised of 16 healthcare professionals who are not employed by the Adviser and do not receive compensation for their services. This network of healthcare professionals is utilized when the Portfolio Manager desires industry expertise and perspective on topics such as healthcare reform, new technologies, and improvements in the delivery of healthcare in the US. Members of the Advisory Group do not provide investment advice and do not make recommendations on behalf of the Fund.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.
Debt Securities Risk. The Fund’s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity securities, such as common stocks, are subject to market, economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate.
Industry Concentration Risk. Because the Fund normally invests at least 80% of the value of its assets in healthcare companies, the Fund’s performance largely depends on the overall condition of the healthcare industry and the Fund is susceptible to economic, political and regulatory risks or other occurrences associated with the healthcare industry.
Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss, cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise.
Micro, Small and Mid-Cap Securities Risk. Investments in securities of companies with micro, small or medium capitalizations involve certain risks that may differ from, or be greater than, those for larger companies, such as higher volatility, lower trading volume, fewer business lines and lack of public information.
Non-U.S. Securities Risk. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, expropriation or political or economic instability).
Portfolio Turnover Risk. High portfolio turnover will increase the Fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains, higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance.
Short Sales Risk. Short sales that are not made “against-the-box” (as defined under “Description of Principal Investments”) theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
