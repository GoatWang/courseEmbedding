SEI Investments Distribution Co. (1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA, 19456) is the distributor for the Causeway Funds. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.  






Investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Diversification does not prevent all investment losses.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be viewed and downloaded by clicking here or by calling 1-866-947-7000. Read it carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the Causeway Funds will meet their stated objectives. The Funds are available to U.S. investors only. Except for Causeway Global Absolute Return Fund, there is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.
#The Causeway Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO). SIDCO is not affiliated with Causeway Capital Management LLC.

Company History

Share












Causeway began operations in June 2001, yet the investment track record of our management team spans 25 years. In October 1990, Sarah Ketterer founded the international value strategy for Los Angeles-based firm, Hotchkis & Wiley. Harry Hartford joined her in 1994. Sarah and Harry continued to manage the international value strategy when Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) purchased Hotchkis & Wiley in 1996, leading a team that managed approximately $3.5 billion in assets. In 2001, members of the international value equity team from the Hotchkis & Wiley division of MLIM left to form Causeway. 



          The team believed that an independent, employee-owned firm could better serve its clients through continuity and consistency of its investment strategies. The new Causeway team of 25 people included portfolio managers, fundamental and quantitative analysts, sales, operations, and compliance staff —many of whom remain on staff today. 

Since beginning operations, Causeway has carefully and deliberately built its global equity management business to expand investment choices for our clients. Today, Causeway manages strategies that invest in major equity markets across the globe, spanning the U.S., international, and emerging markets, and our global absolute return strategy obtains both long and short exposures to securities. We manage money on behalf of individual investors, their advisors, as well institutions, with our rigorous and disciplined fundamental value and our quantitative strategies.          





          A comprehensive research department of fundamental and quantitative analysts supports our global equity strategies, available through separate accounts and commingled vehicles including mutual funds. An unwavering commitment to our clients’ best interests has led us to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns and exceptional service to our clients over the long term. Causeway manages approximately $52.5 billion in assets (as of 6/30/17) and the firm has 83 employees, 30 of whom are investment professionals.

Philosophy



We believe that we can outperform our clients’ benchmarks over the long-term by combining fundamental and quantitative research to identify investment opportunities in equity markets around the world. We seek to achieve superior returns over full market cycles while generally taking the level of risk consistent with the return potential.


          We continue to recognize where markets are evolving and how clients are thinking about equities, and we respond with strategies based on what we do best: buying mispriced equities and seeking upside potential in both developed and emerging markets. Our mission  Entrusted with the stewardship of our clients’ assets, we strive to provide superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a culture of responsibility and accountability. We adhere to four key tenets:  Client focus — We are responsible for putting our clients’ needs above all others. We are accountable for exceeding our clients’ expectations.  Respect for fellow employees — We are responsible for fostering a work environment that encourages independent thinking, camaraderie and enthusiasm. We are accountable for the career growth and development of each of our employees.  Pride of ownership — As owners, we are responsible to commit the highest level of dedication to our profession. We are solely accountable for the direction and public perception of the firm.  Commitment to family — We are responsible for our employees maintaining a healthy balance between work and family. We are accountable to our employees’ families.  Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)  Causeway is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), a voluntary framework for incorporating ESG issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices.  For more information on our policy, please click HERE.

The Causeway Legend



Along the coastal cliffs of Northern Ireland, over 40,000 basalt columns interlock in a unique topology to form the Giant’s Causeway. Geologists attribute the origin of the Causeway to the cooling of multiple lava flows upon contact with the sea over 60 million years ago. Yet, according to local legend, the geographical wonder was formed when giant Finn McCool hurled lumps of earth into the Irish Sea to build a bridge between Ireland and Scotland.


          This distinctive bridge between lands symbolizes timelessness, survival, and permanence. At Causeway, we share a deep commitment to the enduring virtues of thorough analysis, critical debate, and the cultivation of talent. Moreover, the structure of our research team reflects the interlocking columns of the Causeway. We draw on the innovative spirit of the legendary Finn McCool as we blend quantitative and fundamental research to help our clients reach their goals. This spirit of innovation is pervasive at Causeway. We are a firm of new ideas, cutting-edge research and proprietary models. Causeway is a place where new ideas are generated and old practices challenged.

At Causeway Capital Management LLC, we are entrusted with the stewardship of our clientsÃ¢â¬â¢ assets. To that end, our mission is to provide consistent superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a culture of responsibility and accountability. We seek to achieve this through adherence to four key tenets:

Client Focus

Pride of Ownership
As owners, we are responsible to commit the highest level of dedication to our profession. We are solely accountable for the direction and public perception of the firm.

SEI Investments Distribution Co. (1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA, 19456) is the distributor for the Causeway Funds. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.  






Investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Diversification does not prevent all investment losses.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be viewed and downloaded by clicking here or by calling 1-866-947-7000. Read it carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the Causeway Funds will meet their stated objectives. The Funds are available to U.S. investors only. Except for Causeway Global Absolute Return Fund, there is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.
#The Causeway Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO). SIDCO is not affiliated with Causeway Capital Management LLC.
