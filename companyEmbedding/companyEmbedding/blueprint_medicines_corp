Pipeline






Blueprint Medicines is rapidly advancing a deep pipeline of potent and selective kinase inhibitors for genomically defined subsets of patients with cancer and other debilitating diseases driven by the abnormal activation of kinases. By identifying patients most likely to respond to our therapies, we believe that we can increase the efficiency of drug development and the likelihood of success, delivering transformative medicines for patients who currently lack effective treatments.
Since starting operations in 2011, we have advanced our two lead drug candidates , BLU-285 and BLU-554, into three Phase 1 clinical trials and have multiple discovery-stage programs in our pipeline.

BLU-285 FOR UNRESECTABLE, TREATMENT-RESISTANT GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS (GIST)
 







Phase 1



 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES



 

RESEARCH

						 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
						 






Phase 1



BLU-285 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PDGFRα D842V and KIT Exon 17 mutants, key drivers of metastatic and treatment-resistant GIST, and is being developed for these genomically defined subsets of GIST patients. GIST is the most common form of sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract.  The PDGFRα D842V mutation is found in an estimated 5 percent of frontline unresectable or metastatic GIST patients, a patient population for which there is no approved medical therapy.  For patients with KIT-driven GIST, treatment with the currently approved therapies often leads to the emergence of KIT Exon 17 mutants and recurrence of disease. In preclinical studies, BLU-285 has demonstrated proof-of-concept and significant anti-tumor activity, including complete and sustained tumor regression, in a preclinical treatment-resistant model of GIST. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for BLU-285 for the treatment of patients with unresectable, treatment-resistant GIST, and we are currently enrolling patients.

 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES






BLU-285 FOR ADVANCED SYSTEMIC MASTOCYTOSIS (SM)
 







Phase 1



 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES



 

RESEARCH

						 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
						 






Phase 1



BLU-285 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PDGFRα D842V and KIT Exon 17 mutants and is being developed as a highly targeted therapy for SM, a disorder of the mast cells in which a KIT Exon 17 mutation is the primary driver of disease. Advanced forms of SM have significant morbidity related to symptoms from mast cell degranulation and shortened life expectancy due to multi-organ dysfunction/failure from mast cell infiltration and tissue destruction.  More than 94 percent of SM patients display the KIT Exon 17 D816V mutation in their mast cells; there is no effective approved targeted therapy for these patients. In preclinical studies, BLU-285 has demonstrated proof-of-concept and resulted in significant disease control in a mouse mast cell tumor model. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for BLU-285 for treatment of patients with advanced SM, including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage diseases (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and we are currently enrolling patients. To learn more about this clinical trial, please click here.

 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES






BLU-554 FOR ADVANCED HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC)
 







Phase 1



 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES



 

RESEARCH

						 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
						 






Phase 1



BLU-554 is an exquisitely selective and potent kinase inhibitor that we will initially develop for a genomically defined subset of HCC patients. HCC is the most prevalent form of liver cancer and is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. BLU-554 targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), while sparing other members of the FGFR family and showing little to no inhibition of all other kinases. Aberrant signaling of FGFR4 is a key driver in up to 30 percent of HCC, and BLU-554 has shown significant anti-tumor activity, including complete and sustained tumor regression, in preclinical models of HCC. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for BLU-554 for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC, and we are currently enrolling patients. To learn more about this clinical trial, please click here.

 







Phase 1



 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES






BLU-667 FOR RET MUTATIONS,FUSIONS, AND PREDICTED RESISTANT MUTANTS
 







Phase 1



 BLUEPRINT MEDICINES



 

RESEARCH

						 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
						 






Phase 1



Our drug candidate BLU-667 is a potent and selective inhibitor of RET mutations, fusions, and predicted resistant mutants. RET fusions are key drivers of multiple cancers, including lung and thyroid cancer, and our research suggests that RET also plays a key role in some colon and breast cancers. By simultaneously targeting the primary driver and predicted resistant mutants that render cancer cells insensitive to treatment with currently approved drugs, our goal is to provide more lasting clinical responses and prevent or delay recurrences of the disease. In preclinical studies, our compounds demonstrated tumor regression in disease models driven by the primary RET fusion and predicted resistance mutants.

Corporate Overview






Blueprint Medicines is developing a new generation of highly selective and potent kinase therapies to dramatically improve the lives of patients with genomically defined diseases.
Our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of the genetic blueprint of cancer and other diseases driven by the abnormal activation of kinases. We believe our ability to identify novel drivers of disease, coupled with our proprietary library of novel and diverse chemical compounds, uniquely enables us to craft kinase therapies against new and difficult-to-drug targets.
 

 
We are boldly advancing a deep pipeline of highly targeted therapies against previously unaddressed drivers of disease. By focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients, we believe we can identify the people most likely to respond to our therapies, resulting in a more efficient clinical development path with a greater likelihood of success and better outcomes for patients.
“By targeting genomic drivers of cancer and other diseases, we believe we can get the right drugs to the right patients, offering them meaningful and lasting responses to treatment.”


We see a substantial opportunity in kinase drug discovery and development to deliver breakthrough medicines that allow patients to live longer with better quality of life and prevent recurrences of disease. Kinases are involved in many hallmarks of tumor biology and are proven cancer drug targets. Currently approved drugs focus on less than 5 percent of known kinases, and the function of most kinases is unknown.
Led by a team of industry innovators with a track record of bringing life-changing drugs to market, we believe Blueprint Medicines has the experience and expertise to deliver on the tremendous untapped potential of kinase therapies to improve patients’ lives.

He began his pharmaceutical career at Schering-Plough Corp., where his research involved studies on recombinant interferons. Nick has been awarded the Japan Prizes for his work on Gleevec. Other awards include the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize, the AACR-Bruce F. Cain Memorial Award and the Charles F. Kettering Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation. He earned a BS in biochemistry and zoology from the University of Leeds, England, and received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Medical Sciences Institute, University of Dundee, Scotland.





Brian Druker, M.D.
Director of the Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute and JELD-WEN Chair of Leukemia Research
Brian is one of our scientific founders and a scientific advisor to the company. He is an internationally respected researcher. Along with our other scientific founders, Nick Lydon, Ph.D., and Charles L. Sawyers, M.D., he was the recipient of the 2009 Lasker-DeBakey Award for Clinical Medical Research for his groundbreaking work with Gleevec® (imatinib), a targeted kinase inhibitor that transformed chronic myeloid leukemia from a fatal cancer into a manageable disease. Currently, Brian serves as the director of the Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute and is the JELD-WEN Chair of Leukemia Research. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Brian conducted the first clinical studies of Gleevec, demonstrating that the drug could effectively return blood cell counts to normal in CML patients, with only minor side effects. Brian is currently focused on developing effective treatments for patients whose leukemia eventually recurs while taking Gleevec. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Medal of Honor from the American Cancer Society and many other awards. Brian received his M.D. from the University of California School of Medicine at San Diego, completed his residency in internal medicine at Washington University in St. Louis and performed his oncology fellowship at Harvard Medical School’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.





Charles L. Sawyers, M.D.
Director, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Charles is one of our scientific founders and a scientific advisor to the company. He is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and director of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Along with our other scientific founders, Nick Lydon, Ph.D., and Brian Druker, M.D., he was the recipient of the 2009 Lasker-DeBakey Award for Clinical Medical Research for his work on Gleevec® (imatinib), including designing the first clinical trial for the targeted kinase inhibitor, which has transformed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from a fatal cancer into a manageable disease. Charles also played a key role in the development of Sprycel (dasatinib), another kinase inhibitor approved to treat CML. His laboratory is currently focused on characterizing signal transduction pathway abnormalities in prostate cancer. He is also building a program of lab-based translational researchers MSKCC as well as institutional infrastructure to enhance the application of genomics tools to clinical trials.

Charles has a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University, an MD from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and completed his postdoctoral studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.





Scott Lowe, Ph.D.
Member of the Cancer Biology and Genetics Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute Cancer Center and Chair of the Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center
Scott is one of our founders and scientific advisors. He is a member of the Cancer Biology and Genetics Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), where he serves as the associate director for Basic Cancer Research. He is also chair of the Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Dr. Lowe’s current research is based on the premise that the path of cancer evolution dictates a tumor’s subsequent response to therapy and creates unique vulnerabilities that represent therapeutic opportunities. His laboratory applies mouse models, RNA interference and cancer genomics in a coordinated effort to gain a more comprehensive understanding of tumor suppressor networks and identify cancer maintenance genes that will be useful therapeutic targets relevant to specific cancer genotypes. His earlier research made important contributions to our understanding of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, as well as the processes of multi-step carcinogenesis, cellular senescence, and tumor-cell drug resistance. Dr. Lowe’s work has been recognized by several awards, including a Sydney Kimmel Foundation Scholar Award, a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar Award, the AACR Outstanding Investigator Award, AACR-NFCR Professorship in Basic Cancer Research, Alfred G. Knudsen Award in Cancer Genetics, and the Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research. He received a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and received his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

					Full Description



Blueprint Medicines Corporation, incorporated on October 14, 2008, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on patients with genomically defined diseases driven by abnormal kinase activation. The Company focuses on crafting drug candidates that provide clinical responses to patients without adequate treatment options. The Company has developed a small molecule drug pipeline in cancer and a genetic disease. The Company's drug candidate, BLU-285, targets KIT, including Exon 17 mutations, and targets PDGFRa, including the D842V mutation. These mutations activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Its drug candidate BLU-554 targets FGFR4, a kinase that is activated in a defined subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the common type of liver cancer.The Company is focused on BLU-285 in an ongoing Phase I clinical trial for defined subsets of patients with GIST and an ongoing Phase I clinical trial for advanced SM. GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract and SM is a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. The Company is engaged in developing BLU-667, a drug candidate that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by mutations or translocations and RET resistant mutants that it predicts will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET is a driver of disease in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cancers of the thyroid, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In addition, the Company has predicted neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) resistant mutants.GIST is a tumor type that depends on continued signaling of a single, active kinase. Most GISTs result from primary mutations in KIT or PDGFRa. Imatinib inhibits KIT primary mutations, however over time, secondary mutations occur elsewhere in the KIT gene that lead to kinase activation despite the presence of imatinib, thereby leading to disease progression. The most common mutation in the PDGFRa gene is D842V, found in frontline unresectable or metastatic GIST patients. The inhibitory potency of BLU-285 and imatinib against PDGFRa D842V was evaluated in an in vitro enzyme activity assay and in a cellular model driven by an activated PDGFRa D842V mutant protein.
