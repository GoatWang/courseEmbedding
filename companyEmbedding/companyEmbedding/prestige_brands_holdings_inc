We are a company of brand builders. We have grown our company by acquiring strong and well-recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies. We believe that these brands were considered non-core under previous ownership and, in most cases, did not benefit from the focus of senior level management, strong brand support or innovation.

Our management has provided our core brands with the marketing support and senior level attention necessary to enhance the brand's market position, expand its distribution and successfully launch line extensions and new products, with the goal of maintaining and enhancing consumer satisfaction.

History[edit]
Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. was established in 1999 to acquire, revitalize, and line extend leading, often neglected but healthy brands that were considered non-core at major consumer products companies. In 2004, MidOcean Partners sold Prestige Brands to GTCH Golder Rauner.[3]
Acquisitions:
The Company acquired Blacksmith Brands' portfolio of 5 brands in 2010.
In December 2011, the Company agreed to purchase 17 brands from GlaxoSmithKline which included BC Powder, Beano, Ecotrin, Fiber Choice, Goody's Powder, Sominex and Tagamet for $660 Million.[4]
In 2013, Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. acquired Care Pharmaceuticals of Bondi Junction, New South Wales Australia, a privately held marketer and distributor of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare brands for children and adults.[5]
In 2014, the Company purchased Hydralyte™ in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia. Hydralyte is the leading oral rehydration product in Australia & New Zealand.[6]
In April 2014, Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Insight Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other over-the-counter healthcare products, for $750 million in cash.[7]
In November 2015, Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DenTek Oral Care Inc. (“DenTek”), a privately-held marketer and distributor of oral care products for $225 million in cash. [8]
In December 2016, Prestige Brands Holdings Inc., home to brands including Monistat, Dramamine and Luden’s, has agreed to buy C.B. Fleet Co. from private-equity firm Gryphon Investors for about $825 million. [9]
Divestitures:
In 2009, Prestige sold its Denorex and Prell brands of shampoo. It has since divested Phazyme (2012); Fiber Choice, PediaCare, New-Skin, and Dermoplast (2016).

This is an effort to maintain a correct and accurate database in order to protect and promote the public health. Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct the violations. Your response should include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations and copies of supporting documentation. If you cannot complete these corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will have completed the corrections. Please be aware that in order for your revised SPL submission to be accepted, a manual override may be required for certain types of errors. If you receive a validation error, or have any questions regarding the contents of this letter, please contact us at edrls@fda.hhs.gov for further assistance. Include the case identification number of 594 -595 on all correspondences. Your reply should be sent to: Tasneem Hussain, Pharm.

Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.                                                                                   Sincerely,/S/Paul Loebach   Cc:       New York District Office [1] See FD&C Act Section 510 (j)(1)(A), 21 CFR Part 207.49 (a) (4)
