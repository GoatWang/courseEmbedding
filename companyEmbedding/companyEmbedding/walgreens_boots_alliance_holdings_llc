Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Operations[edit]
Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
Walgreens has stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced the purchase of competitor Rite Aid for $17.2 billion.[7]
Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides

Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

		Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) Stock Won’t Yield to Amazon	
Walgreens has nothing to fear from the merger, but that doesn't make WBA stock a buy at the moment

Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchase of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) last week sent shockwaves through the market, and several sectors in particular felt pressure. The obvious losers were the grocery stores that now have to deal with the invading retail giant. But another group that weakened was the pharmacy companies such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).
Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr

Rumors swirled that Amazon would use its new brick-and-mortar locations to get into that business as well. WBA stock was one of the hardest hit, falling 5% the day of the WFM buyout announcement. In fact, Walgreens has had only one up day since, and closed Thursday just 0.5% from its 52-week low.
At this point in time, there have been no indications that Amazon is actually planning on moving into the pharmacy business — it would be far in the future if it did — so I believe any concerns of Walgreens losing business to the retail giant are unwarranted.
However, I do understand why people are dumping their holdings. WBA stock has lagged the market for the last two years, and the Amazon news was merely another reason to head for the hills.
The fact of the matter is that purchasing Whole Foods was the easiest way for Amazon to break into the grocery space, which is something the company had been hinting at for years. Management realized that buying their way into the segment was the best course of action, and I suspect they would do something similar if they decided to move into pharmacy as well.
Unlike in grocery, the pharmacy business involves regulations and relationships with pharmacy benefit management companies. Deciding one day to sell pharmaceuticals isn’t exactly realistic.
I don’t believe Walgreens has anything to fear from the Amazon/Whole Foods merger, but the chart does tell a different story as it has been underperforming both recently and for years.

There is also the unknown of how the potential Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) buyout will play out now that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the final say on whether it gets approved.
In a market that has sectors regularly hitting new highs, I would avoid the pharmacy space altogether. However, the decision is based on a whole lot more than just Amazon.

	This calculation is based on 225,424,994 shares of Common Stock outstanding (as reported by the Issuer in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016), reflecting the number of shares of Common
	Stock outstanding as of March 16, 2016 adjusted to give effect to the issuance of 22,696,912 shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of Warrant 1.







	This Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D (this 

	Amendment No. 3

	) amends and supplements
	the Schedule 13D (the 

	Schedule 13D

	) relating to the common stock, $0.01 par value per share (

	Common Stock

	), of AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the 

	Issuer

	),
	originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	SEC

	) on April 9, 2014, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed on January 16, 2015 and Amendment No. 2 thereto filed on January 25,
	2016. Terms used but not defined in this Amendment No. 3 have the respective meanings given to such terms in the original Schedule 13D, as previously amended.


	 






	Item 2

	.





	Identity and Background

	.





	Item 2 is amended and supplemented as follows:


	This Amendment No. 3 is being filed by: (i) Walgreens Boots Alliance Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (

	WBA
	Holdings

	) (f/k/a WAB Holdings LLC); (ii) Walgreens Pharmacy Strategies, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (

	WPS

	); (iii) Bond Drug Company of Illinois, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company
	(

	Bond Drug

	); (iv) Walgreen Eastern Co., Inc., a New York corporation (

	WEC

	); (v) Walgreen Arizona Drug Co., an Arizona corporation (

	WADC

	); (vi) Walgreen Hastings Co., a Nebraska
	corporation (

	WHC

	); (vii) Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation (

	Walgreen

	); (viii) WBA Investments, Inc., a Delaware corporation (

	WBA Investments

	); and (ix) Walgreens Boots
	Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (

	WBA

	). WBA Holdings, WPS, Bond Drug, WEC, WADC, WHC, Walgreen, WBA Investments and WBA are collectively referred to as the 

	Reporting Persons

	.


	WBA Holdings was formed solely for the purpose of investing in the Issuer. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock reported as beneficially owned by any
	Reporting Person in this Schedule 13D (including shares received upon the exercise in full of Warrant 1) are held by WBA Holdings. In addition, WBA Holdings is the holder of Warrant 2 (as defined in the Schedule 13D) as of the filing of this
	Amendment No. 3. WBA Holdings is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA Investments. WBA Investments is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA. WBA, together with its subsidiaries, including the Reporting Persons, is a global
	pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise.


	In connection with the completion of an internal reorganization of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of
	WBA (the internal reorganization) subsequent to the filing of Amendment No. 2, all of the outstanding ownership interests of WBA Holdings were distributed up from WPS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA, to WBA, and WBA
	contributed such ownership interests to WBA Investments, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA. As a result of the completion of the internal reorganization, each of WPS, Bond Drug, WEC, WADC, WHC and Walgreen do not beneficially own any of the
	shares of Common Stock or Warrants held by WBA Holdings as of the filing of this Amendment No. 3 and, accordingly, will not be Reporting Persons in future amendments to this Schedule 13D. WPS is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Bond Drug.
	Bond Drug is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WEC. WEC is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WADC. WADC is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WHC. WHC is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreen. Walgreen is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary
	of WBA.


	The principal business office of each of the Reporting Persons is: c/o Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois
	60015.


	Attached as Annex A hereto and incorporated herein by reference is a list containing the (a) name, (b) residence or business address,
	(c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted, and (d) citizenship, in each case, of each director and executive
	officer of the Reporting Persons, as applicable.


	During the last five years, each Reporting Person and, to the knowledge of such Reporting Person, each
	person listed in Annex A with respect to such Reporting Person, has not been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) and has not been a party to a civil proceeding of any judicial or administrative
	body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding of
	any violation with respect to such laws.


	 






	Item 3

	.







	Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

	.





	Item 3 is amended and supplemented as
	follows:


	On March 18, 2016, WBA Holdings exercised Warrant 1 in full, resulting in the acquisition from the Issuer of 22,696,912 shares of Common
	Stock for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $1,168,891,000. Such shares of Common Stock were acquired with cash contributed to WBA Holdings by WBA, on behalf of WBA Investments. Such funds were available from cash on WBAs balance
	sheet.









	Item 4

	.







	Purpose of Transaction

	.





	Item 4 is amended and supplemented as follows:


	On March 18, 2016, WBA Holdings exercised Warrant 1 in full, resulting in the acquisition from the Issuer of 22,696,912 shares of Common Stock for an
	aggregate exercise price of approximately $1,168,891,000. The shares of Common Stock reported by WBA Holdings, WBA Investments and WBA in this Schedule 13D are held by WBA Holdings and are comprised of Initial Open Market Shares as defined in the
	Framework Agreement and the shares issued upon the exercise of Warrant 1. WBA Holdings is also the holder of Warrant 2.


	Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
	Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act), WBA Holdings would be permitted to increase its ownership level up to 25% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock prior to May 1, 2018 without making a further filing
	under the HSR Act. However, no decisions have been made regarding future transactions, if any, or their timing. Those determinations will depend upon various factors described in the original Schedule 13D, including market conditions and other
	factors.


	Upon the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 and related holding company reorganization, each of Walgreen and
	Alliance Boots GmbH became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA. In addition, the LLC Agreement of WBA Holdings was amended and restated in March 2016 to reflect customary arrangements for a wholly-owned subsidiary of WBA. Accordingly, the caption
	The Transaction Rights Agreement and WAB Holdings LLC Agreement and the disclosure in the first seven paragraphs thereunder (primarily relating to matters applicable or relevant only if the Second Step Transaction was not completed) in
	the original Schedule 13D are hereby deleted.


	Ms. Ornella Barra, Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive, Global Wholesale and
	International Retail of WBA, was appointed to, and serves as, a member of the Issuers Board of Directors pursuant to the Initial Designation Right. Ms. Barra succeeded Gregory D. Wasson, the former President and Chief Executive of
	Walgreen, as the designee pursuant to the Initial Designation Right following Mr. Wassons retirement from Walgreen in January 2015.


	 






	Item 5

	.





	Interest in Securities of the Issuer

	.





	Item 5 is hereby amended by adding the following:


	(a) and (b). The ownership percentages set forth below are based on 225,424,994 shares of Common Stock outstanding, as reported by the Issuer in its
	Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016, reflecting the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 16, 2016 adjusted to give effect to the issuance of 22,696,912 shares of Common Stock issued upon the
	exercise of Warrant 1. WBA Holdings may be deemed to beneficially own 34,157,955 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 15.15% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, as of the filing of this Amendment No. 3.


	By virtue of relationships reported in Item 2, each of WBA Investments and WBA may be deemed to share the power to vote or direct to vote or to direct
	the voting of, and to dispose of or to direct the disposition of and, accordingly, may be deemed to beneficially own the 34,157,955 shares of Common Stock held by WBA Holdings, representing approximately 15.15% of the total number of shares of
	Common Stock outstanding, as of the filing of this Amendment No. 3.


	As a result of the completion of the internal reorganization, each of WPS, Bond
	Drug, WEC, WADC, WHC and Walgreen no longer beneficially own any shares of Common Stock of the Issuer as of the filing of this Amendment No. 3.


	Neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission by any Reporting Person (other than WBA Holdings)
	that it is the beneficial owner of any shares of Common Stock for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed.


	(c), (d) and (e). The information set forth in the third paragraph of Item 2 of this Amendment No. 3 is incorporated herein by reference. On
	March 18, 2016, WBA Holdings acquired 22,696,912 shares of Common Stock from the Issuer for $51.50 per share ($1,168,891,000 aggregate exercise price) upon the exercise in full of Warrant 1. With respect to each Reporting Person, such Reporting
	Person and, to the knowledge of such Reporting Person, the persons listed in Annex A hereto with respect to such Reporting Person, have not otherwise effected any transaction in shares of Common Stock in the past 60 days.


	Other than WBA Holdings, WBA Investments and WBA and the persons listed in Annex A hereto with respect thereto, no other person is known to have the right to
	receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock covered by this Schedule 13D.

About us




			Walgreens Boots Alliance is the first global pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. Our purpose is to help people across the world lead healthier and happier lives.

Walgreens Boots Alliance was created through the combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in December 2014. This transaction brought together two leading companies with iconic brands, complementary geographic footprints, shared values and a heritage of trusted healthcare services through pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care, dating back more than 100 years.

Walgreens Boots Alliance is the largest retail pharmacy, health and daily living destination across the USA and Europe. Together with its equity method investments, Walgreens Boots Alliance has a presence in more than 25* countries and employs more than 400,000* people. The company is a global leader in pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing retail with over 13,200* stores in 11* countries as well as one of the largest global pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution networks, with over 390* distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000** pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year in more than 20* countries. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the world’s largest purchasers of prescription drugs and many other health and wellbeing products.

The Company’s size, scale, and expertise will help us to expand the supply, and address the rising cost of, prescription drugs in the USA and worldwide.

The Company has:
 

unmatched supply chain and procurement expertise, offering customers innovative solutions and optimal efficiencies
a portfolio of retail and business brands, including Walgreens, Duane Reade, Boots and Alliance Healthcare, as well as increasingly global health and beauty product brands, such as No7, Botanics, Liz Earle and Soap & Glory
diversified and robust profit pools across the USA, Europe and key emerging markets
a unique platform for growth in developed and emerging markets

 
By leveraging these advantages and opportunities, as well as the full benefit of our best practices and expertise, Walgreens Boots Alliance will be positioned to create substantial incremental efficiency, synergy and growth opportunities.

The creation of Walgreens Boots Alliance provides an opportunity to further accelerate the development of a fully integrated, global platform for the future to provide innovative ways to address health and wellness challenges. Our Company is well positioned to expand customer offerings in existing markets and become the health and wellbeing partner of choice in emerging markets. 

Walgreens Boots Alliance ranks No. 1 in the Food and Drug Stores industry of Fortune magazine’s 2017 list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. This is the 24th consecutive year that Walgreens Boots Alliance or its predecessor company, Walgreen Co., have been named to the list.

* As of 31 August 2016, using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen.
**For 12 months ending 31 August 2016, using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen.

Walgreen was a Chicago pharmacist with a dream. In 1901, he went from drugstore employee to employer when he bought the place and become his own boss. But, he wasn’t content with just one location. Expansion and a mission to revolutionize the pharmacy were on his mind. Within 25 years, there were 100 store locations in Chicago. Fast-forward to today, and Walgreens now employs 240,000 people and tallies 8,678 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Guam. And just as successful on the expansion front, Walgreens has continued to develop the neighborhood pharmacy with its ever-evolving website. There, instead of going to the store, customers can manage and refill prescriptions online—a development that has helped Walgreens earn the 36th ranking on the Internet Retailer 500.Is it time to re-stock the supply of everyday items at your home?

Walgreen was a Chicago pharmacist with a dream. In 1901, he went from drugstore employee to employer when he bought the place and become his own boss. But, he wasn’t content with just one location. Expansion and a mission to revolutionize the pharmacy were on his mind. Within 25 years, there were 100 store locations in Chicago. Fast-forward to today, and Walgreens now employs 240,000 people and tallies 8,678 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Guam.

There, instead of going to the store, customers can manage and refill prescriptions online—a development that has helped Walgreens earn the 36th ranking on the Internet Retailer 500.Is it time to re-stock the supply of everyday items at your home?

There, instead of going to the store, customers can manage and refill prescriptions online—a development that has helped Walgreens earn the 36th ranking on the Internet Retailer 500.Is it time to re-stock the supply of everyday items at your home?

The Walgreen Company (simply Walgreens, or sometimes archaically Walgreen) is an American company which operates[2] as the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the United States behind CVS Health. It specializes in filling prescriptions, health and wellness products, health information, and photo services.[3] As of August 31, 2016, the company operated 8,175 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1901. The Walgreens headquarters office is in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois.
In 2014, the company agreed to purchase the remaining 55% of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own to form a global business. Under the terms of the purchase, the two companies merged to form a new holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., on December 31, 2014. Walgreens became a subsidiary of the new company, which retains its Deerfield headquarters and trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol WBA.[4]

History[edit]
Company history[edit]




Early "Walgreen Drugs" sign still in use in San Antonio, Texas


Walgreens began in 1901, with a drug store on the corner of Bowen Ave and Cottage Grove in Chicago, owned by Galesburg native Charles R. Walgreen, Sr.[5] By 1913, Walgreens had grown to four stores on Chicago's South Side. It opened its fifth in 1915, and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of alcohol prohibition, the 1920s was a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.[6]
In 1922, the company introduced a malted milkshake, which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid-1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000. Walgreens had expanded into Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.
By 1930, it had 397 stores with annual sales of US$4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.[7] The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression did not greatly affect the company. In 1934, Walgreens was operating in 30 states with 601 stores.
After Charles Walgreen, Sr., died in 1939, his son Charles R. Walgreen took over the chain until his retirement. The Charles R. Walgreen years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles "Cork" R. Walgreen III took over after Walgreen Jr.'s retirement in the early 1950s and modernized the company by switching to barcode scanning. The Walgreen family was not involved in senior management of the company for a short time following Walgreen III's retirement. In 1986, it acquired the MediMart chain from Stop & Shop.[8] In 1995, Kevin P. Walgreen was made a vice-president and promoted to Senior Vice President - Store Operations in 2006.[9]

On July 12, 2006, David Bernauer stepped down as CEO of Walgreens, replaced by company president Jeff Rein. Holding degrees in accounting and pharmacy from the University of Arizona, Rein was a pharmacist, store manager, district manager, and treasurer prior to being named Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Greg Wasson, former President of Walgreens Health Services, was named President and Chief Operations Officer.
On October 10, 2008, Rein abruptly quit as CEO, replaced by Alan G. McNally as Chairman and Acting CEO.[10]
On January 26, 2009, Gregory Wasson was named CEO, effective February 1, 2009.[11]
21st-century expansion[edit]




A neon-lit store on Canal Street in New Orleans

March 24, 2011: Walgreens acquired Drugstore.com for $409 million. Drugstore.com, in turn, owned Beauty.com. In 2013 Beauty.com was named by Internet Retailer Magazine in its Top 100 online retail sites list.[17][18]
April 30, 2011: Walgreens operated 8,169 stores; it had expanded into Guam and Puerto Rico.[citation needed]

July 5, 2012: Walgreens entered into an agreement to acquire Mid-South drug store chain operating under the USA Drug, Super D Drug, May's Drug, Med-X, and Drug Warehouse banners. The deal was expected to be finalized by September 1, 2012.[21]
September 10, 2013: Walgreens announced it acquired Kerr Drug.[22]
August 6, 2014: Walgreens exercised its option to purchase the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots. The combined company is known as the Walgreens Boots Alliance and is headquartered in Chicago.[23][24]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire its rival Rite Aid for $9 per share, a deal valued at $9.4 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal will result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[25] In response to being able to receive approval, Walgreens said that it would be willing to divest up to 1,000 stores to win regulatory approval for its Rite Aid purchase.[26] Walgreens and Rite Aid, combined, own approximately 200 million square feet of retail space in addition to 21 million square feet of office and warehouse space. The two chains operate 12,900 stores in the United States. Walgreens operates 13,100 stores across 11 countries. Walgreens CEO has stated that there is potentially over $1 billion in savings to be reaped from the merger through synergies.[27] On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 Million USD for antitrust reasons.[28] In January 2017, Walgreens reached a deal to lower the price of the acquisition from $9.4 to $6.8-$7.4 billion and delayed the closing by six months.[29] On June 29, 2017, Walgreens announced that it would drop its original plan to acquire Rite Aid due to resistance from federal regulators, and would instead buy about half of Rite Aid's existing stores for $5.18 billion in cash. [30]Under the terms of the agreement, Walgreens will acquire 2,186 stores, 3 distribution centers, and other Rite Aid inventory[31]. The stores are expected to be converted from Rite Aid stores into Walgreens stores, making Walgreens the largest drug-store chain by number of locations in the U.S. with over 10,200 stores.[32] The company also agreed to pay Rite Aid a $325 million fee for ending the earlier merger agreements.[33] The new deal is expected to close within the next 6 months, pending regulatory approval. [34]


July 28, 2016, Walgreens announced it would shut down Drugstore.com, as well as Beauty.com, in order to focus on its own Walgreens.com website.[35]

Contributions to popular culture[edit]
Walgreens claims credit for the popularization of the malted milkshake (or at least its version of the malted milkshake), invented by Ivar "Pop" Coulson in 1922,[36] although milkshakes and malted milk had been around for some time before. This development coincided with the invention of the electric blender in the same year.
In November 2010, Walgreens filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Wegmans supermarket chain, claiming the "W" in the Wegman's logo is too similar to Walgreens'.[37] The lawsuit was settled in April 2011, with Wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its "W" logo by June 2012, although the supermarket retains the right to use the “Wegmans” name in script.[38] According to Jo Natale, Wegmans director of media relations, “The cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end.”[39]
The logo for the Washington Nationals baseball team is similar to the Walgreens "W";[40] to date, Walgreens never challenged the Nationals' use of their "W" in a lawsuit.
Corporate operations[edit]
Walgreens has its corporate headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois.[41][42] As of 2009, Walgreens employed 5,200 people at its headquarters.[43]
In 1987, Walgreens employed about 1,100 people at its headquarters, which was at the time in an unincorporated area on the west side of Deerfield.[44][45] As of 2000, headquarters was still in an unincorporated area in West Deerfield Township.[46]
In the summer of 2014, a corporate relocation to Switzerland was considered as part of a merger with Alliance Boots, a European drugstore chain.[47] This drew controversy as many consumers felt that it was an attempt at tax inversion. On August 5, 2014, Walgreens announced that they would not be relocating their headquarters.
Store model[edit]




A Walgreens on Rt.1 South, Saugus, Massachusetts.


Walgreens stores were originally connected to local groceries. In Chicago, their flagship market, they teamed up with either Eagle Food Centers or Dominick's Finer Foods, usually with a "walkthru" to the adjoining store and often sharing personnel. This concept was instated to compete with the popular dual store format used by chief competitor Jewel-Osco/Albertsons-Sav-On. They eventually ended the relationship with Eagle and focused primarily on a connection to the Dominick's stores. PharmX-Rexall filled the vacated Walgreen locations joined to Eagle stores.




A Walgreens "corner drugstore", located in a Marriott street-level retail space, on the corner of a heavily trafficked intersection in Washington, D.C


In its 2009 business model, Walgreens are freestanding corner stores, with the entrance on the street with the most traffic flow, figuratively making it a "corner drugstore" similar to how many independent pharmacies evolved. Some stores have a drive-through pharmacy.[48]
The store management team usually includes a Store Manager (MGR), an Executive Assistant Manager (EXA), and at least one Assistant Manager (MGT). In 2009, Walgreens introduced the Store Team Lead (STL), or "non-management keyholder", position in many of its stores. In 2012, Walgreens announced that they would be phasing out the MGT, EXA, and STL positions for the Assistant Store Manager Trainee (ASM-T), Assistant Store Manager (ASM), and Shift Leader (SFL) positions, respectively. The new management structure will implement a new structure and payscale that will more closely resemble their competitors to reflect the industry standard.
Disability inclusion initiative[edit]
In 2002, Walgreens senior vice president of supply chain and logistics Randy Lewis began a program aimed at providing opportunity to the disabled to work side by side with typical workers. The result was the development and opening of two distribution centers whose staff is approximately 40% disabled. The model was so successful that other companies such as Clarks Companies NA, Glaxo Smith Kline, Best Buy, and Costco have either examined it or placed it under consideration.[49]
Related ventures[edit]




Wag's menu logo circa 1985


Walgreens used to own Sanborns, one of the largest pharmacy and department store chains in Mexico. Walgreens purchased Sanborns from Frank Sanborn in 1946 and sold it to Grupo Carso in 1982.[50]
In the 1980s, Walgreens owned and operated a chain of casual family restaurants/pancake houses called Wag's, an attempt to compete with Woolworth's lunch counters. The Wag's restaurants were very similar in concept to Denny's, IHOP, and Golden Bear. At the highpoint, it had over 100 locations. Walgreens sold most of these to Marriott Corp. in 1988[51] and by 1991, the chain was out of business.
Consumer record[edit]
December 2012, A judge ordered Walgreens to pay $16.57 million to settle a lawsuit. The claim was that over 600 stores were illegally dumping hazardous waste and unlawfully disposing of customer records containing confidential medical information.[52]
Prescriptions[edit]




A Walgreens in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, which opened in 2006.


As of June 2008, Walgreens "agreed to stop altering prescriptions without physician approval as part of a multi-state agreement to settle allegations of improper billing," reported the Knoxville News Sentinel:[53][54]

Walgreens was accused of switching the dosage forms on three medications commonly prescribed for Medicaid patients without doctor approvals in order to boost profits. This resulted in Medicaid programs nationwide paying much more for the medications than they normally would have, according to a press release by the [Tennessee] attorney general's office. Walgreen Co. agreed to comply with state and federal laws on the matter, plus pay $35 million to the federal government, 42 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

"The compliance agreement will be in effect for five years. Walgreens did not admit liability, as part of the settlement," reported the Chicago Sun-Times.[55]
The Walgreens website invited users to write reviews of some OTC products such as vitamins and nutritionals but did not invite users to write reviews of the corresponding Walgreens-branded products. A recent revision of the Walgreens website has added the ability to review any product it sells.
Allegations of discrimination[edit]
In March 2008, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that alleged the company discriminated against African-Americans for $24 million.[56] The settlement was split between the 10,000 African-American employees of the company.[56] In the agreement, Walgreens avoided any admission of guilt.

The decree, one of the largest monetary settlements in a race case by the EEOC, provides for the payment of over $24 million to a class of thousands of African American workers and orders comprehensive injunctive relief designed to improve the company's promotion and store assignment practices.

In September 2011, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which claimed that a store improperly terminated a worker with diabetes for eating a package of the store's food while working to stop a hypoglycemia attack.[57]
Medicaid[edit]
Also, in 2008, Walgreens "agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S., 42 states and Puerto Rico for overcharging state Medicaid programs by filling prescriptions with more expensive dosage forms of ranitidine, a generic form of Zantac and fluoxetine, which is a generic form of Prozac."[58]
In 2009, Walgreens threatened to leave the Medicaid program, the state and federal partnership to provide health insurance coverage to the poor, in Delaware, over reimbursement rates. Walgreens was the largest pharmacy chain in the state and the only chain to make such a threat.[59] The state of Delaware and Walgreens reached an agreement on payment rates and the crisis was averted.[60]
In 2010, Walgreens stopped accepting Medicaid in Washington state, leaving its one million Medicaid recipients unable to get their prescriptions filled at these 121 stores.[61]
On April 20, 2012, the U.S. [Department of Justice] announced, that Walgreens agreed to pay $7.9 million in settlement. The fine relates to allegations of violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act regarding beneficiaries of federal health care programs.[62]
Express Scripts[edit]
In 2011, Walgreens announced it would end its relationship with Express Scripts,[63] a prescription benefits manager. A coalition of minority groups, led by Al Sharpton's National Action Network,[64] sent letters urging CEO Gregory Wasson to reconsider. Groups sending letters were National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference,[65] the Congress of Racial Equality,[66] Hispanic Leadership Fund[67] and others. On July 19, 2012, Walgreens and Express Scripts announced a multi-year pharmacy network agreement that includes rates and terms under which Walgreens would participate in the broadest Express Scripts retail pharmacy network available to new and existing clients as of September 15, 2012.
Use of proprietary drugs[edit]
Walgreens was named in a lawsuit by the Union Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund in the Northern District Court of Illinois in January 2012. The suit alleges Walgreens and Par Pharmaceuticals violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act[68] "at least two widespread schemes to overcharge" for generic drugs.[58]

The lawsuit alleges drugstore chain Walgreen and generic pharmaceutical maker Par established a partnership in which Par manufactured and/or marketed generic versions of antacid Zantac and antidepressant Prozac in dosage forms that weren't subject to private and governmental reimbursement limitations.
It further said Walgreen purchased those dosage forms from par at a cost substantially higher than the widely prescribed dosage forms, and then "systematically and unlawfully filled its customers' prescriptions with Par's more expensive products, rather than the inexpensive dosage forms that were prescribed by physicians."

Distribution of oxycodone[edit]
In September 2012, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of endangering public safety and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, FL a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is "an imminent danger to the public safety." All DEA licensees "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients," said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper."
The Jupiter, Florida distribution center which opened in 2001 is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the single largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said. Over the past three years, its market share has increased, and 52 Walgreens are among the top 100 oxycodone purchasers in the state, the DEA said.[69]
In 2013, United States Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said Walgreens committed "an unprecedented number" of record-keeping and dispensing violations." Walgreens was fined $80 million. At the time, the largest fine in the history of the Controlled Substances Act[70]
Sale of tobacco[edit]
In common with other US pharmacies (a major exception is CVS Pharmacy), Walgreens stocks tobacco products for sale to the public. Some campaigners in the USA advocate the removal of tobacco from pharmacies due to the health risks associated with smoking and the apparent contradiction of selling cigarettes alongside smoking cessation products and asthma medication.[71] Walgreens and other pharmacies who continue to sell tobacco products have been subject to criticism, and attempts have been made to introduce regional bans on the practice, which has taken place in the City and County of San Francisco.[72][73]
Walgreens defends its tobacco sales policy by reasoning that through selling tobacco in its outlets, it is more readily able to offer to customers advice and products for quitting smoking.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Operations[edit]
Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
Walgreens has stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced the purchase of competitor Rite Aid for $17.2 billion.[7]
Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides

Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

The Walgreen Company (simply Walgreens, or sometimes archaically Walgreen) is an American company which operates[2] as the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the United States behind CVS Health. It specializes in filling prescriptions, health and wellness products, health information, and photo services.[3] As of August 31, 2016, the company operated 8,175 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1901. The Walgreens headquarters office is in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois.
In 2014, the company agreed to purchase the remaining 55% of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own to form a global business. Under the terms of the purchase, the two companies merged to form a new holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., on December 31, 2014. Walgreens became a subsidiary of the new company, which retains its Deerfield headquarters and trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol WBA.[4]

Early "Walgreen Drugs" sign still in use in San Antonio, Texas


Walgreens began in 1901, with a drug store on the corner of Bowen Ave and Cottage Grove in Chicago, owned by Galesburg native Charles R. Walgreen, Sr.[5] By 1913, Walgreens had grown to four stores on Chicago's South Side. It opened its fifth in 1915, and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of alcohol prohibition, the 1920s was a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.[6]
In 1922, the company introduced a malted milkshake, which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid-1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000. Walgreens had expanded into Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.
By 1930, it had 397 stores with annual sales of US$4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.[7] The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression did not greatly affect the company. In 1934, Walgreens was operating in 30 states with 601 stores.
After Charles Walgreen, Sr., died in 1939, his son Charles R. Walgreen took over the chain until his retirement. The Charles R. Walgreen years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles "Cork" R. Walgreen III took over after Walgreen Jr.'s retirement in the early 1950s and modernized the company by switching to barcode scanning. The Walgreen family was not involved in senior management of the company for a short time following Walgreen III's retirement. In 1986, it acquired the MediMart chain from Stop & Shop.[8] In 1995, Kevin P. Walgreen was made a vice-president and promoted to Senior Vice President - Store Operations in 2006.[9]

On July 12, 2006, David Bernauer stepped down as CEO of Walgreens, replaced by company president Jeff Rein. Holding degrees in accounting and pharmacy from the University of Arizona, Rein was a pharmacist, store manager, district manager, and treasurer prior to being named Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Greg Wasson, former President of Walgreens Health Services, was named President and Chief Operations Officer.
On October 10, 2008, Rein abruptly quit as CEO, replaced by Alan G. McNally as Chairman and Acting CEO.[10]
On January 26, 2009, Gregory Wasson was named CEO, effective February 1, 2009.[11]
21st-century expansion[edit]




A neon-lit store on Canal Street in New Orleans

February 17, 2010: Walgreens announced plans to acquire New York City-area chain Duane Reade for $1.075 billion, including debt.[16] Walgreens continues to operate in the New York City metropolitan area as Duane Reade; its stores near existing Walgreens were closed.[citation needed]
March 24, 2011: Walgreens acquired Drugstore.com for $409 million. Drugstore.com, in turn, owned Beauty.com. In 2013 Beauty.com was named by Internet Retailer Magazine in its Top 100 online retail sites list.[17][18]
April 30, 2011: Walgreens operated 8,169 stores; it had expanded into Guam and Puerto Rico.[citation needed]
August 18, 2011: Walgreens introduced its "Nice!" store brand of food and household products. Fully rolled out in 2012, the Nice! brand replaced a variety of existing Walgreens store brands such as Deerfield Farms, Cafe W, and others.[19]
June 19, 2012: Walgreens paid $6.7bn for a 45% interest in Alliance Boots.[20]
July 5, 2012: Walgreens entered into an agreement to acquire Mid-South drug store chain operating under the USA Drug, Super D Drug, May's Drug, Med-X, and Drug Warehouse banners. The deal was expected to be finalized by September 1, 2012.[21]
September 10, 2013: Walgreens announced it acquired Kerr Drug.[22]
August 6, 2014: Walgreens exercised its option to purchase the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots. The combined company is known as the Walgreens Boots Alliance and is headquartered in Chicago.[23][24]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire its rival Rite Aid for $9 per share, a deal valued at $9.4 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal will result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[25] In response to being able to receive approval, Walgreens said that it would be willing to divest up to 1,000 stores to win regulatory approval for its Rite Aid purchase.[26] Walgreens and Rite Aid, combined, own approximately 200 million square feet of retail space in addition to 21 million square feet of office and warehouse space. The two chains operate 12,900 stores in the United States. Walgreens operates 13,100 stores across 11 countries. Walgreens CEO has stated that there is potentially over $1 billion in savings to be reaped from the merger through synergies.[27] On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 Million USD for antitrust reasons.[28] In January 2017, Walgreens reached a deal to lower the price of the acquisition from $9.4 to $6.8-$7.4 billion and delayed the closing by six months.[29] On June 29, 2017, Walgreens announced that it would drop its original plan to acquire Rite Aid due to resistance from federal regulators, and would instead buy about half of Rite Aid's existing stores for $5.18 billion in cash. [30]Under the terms of the agreement, Walgreens will acquire 2,186 stores, 3 distribution centers, and other Rite Aid inventory[31]. The stores are expected to be converted from Rite Aid stores into Walgreens stores, making Walgreens the largest drug-store chain by number of locations in the U.S. with over 10,200 stores.[32] The company also agreed to pay Rite Aid a $325 million fee for ending the earlier merger agreements.[33] The new deal is expected to close within the next 6 months, pending regulatory approval. [34]


July 28, 2016, Walgreens announced it would shut down Drugstore.com, as well as Beauty.com, in order to focus on its own Walgreens.com website.[35]

Contributions to popular culture[edit]
Walgreens claims credit for the popularization of the malted milkshake (or at least its version of the malted milkshake), invented by Ivar "Pop" Coulson in 1922,[36] although milkshakes and malted milk had been around for some time before. This development coincided with the invention of the electric blender in the same year.
In November 2010, Walgreens filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Wegmans supermarket chain, claiming the "W" in the Wegman's logo is too similar to Walgreens'.[37] The lawsuit was settled in April 2011, with Wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its "W" logo by June 2012, although the supermarket retains the right to use the “Wegmans” name in script.[38] According to Jo Natale, Wegmans director of media relations, “The cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end.”[39]
The logo for the Washington Nationals baseball team is similar to the Walgreens "W";[40] to date, Walgreens never challenged the Nationals' use of their "W" in a lawsuit.
Corporate operations[edit]
Walgreens has its corporate headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois.[41][42] As of 2009, Walgreens employed 5,200 people at its headquarters.[43]
In 1987, Walgreens employed about 1,100 people at its headquarters, which was at the time in an unincorporated area on the west side of Deerfield.[44][45] As of 2000, headquarters was still in an unincorporated area in West Deerfield Township.[46]
In the summer of 2014, a corporate relocation to Switzerland was considered as part of a merger with Alliance Boots, a European drugstore chain.[47] This drew controversy as many consumers felt that it was an attempt at tax inversion. On August 5, 2014, Walgreens announced that they would not be relocating their headquarters.
Store model[edit]




A Walgreens on Rt.1 South, Saugus, Massachusetts.


Walgreens stores were originally connected to local groceries. In Chicago, their flagship market, they teamed up with either Eagle Food Centers or Dominick's Finer Foods, usually with a "walkthru" to the adjoining store and often sharing personnel. This concept was instated to compete with the popular dual store format used by chief competitor Jewel-Osco/Albertsons-Sav-On. They eventually ended the relationship with Eagle and focused primarily on a connection to the Dominick's stores. PharmX-Rexall filled the vacated Walgreen locations joined to Eagle stores.




A Walgreens "corner drugstore", located in a Marriott street-level retail space, on the corner of a heavily trafficked intersection in Washington, D.C


In its 2009 business model, Walgreens are freestanding corner stores, with the entrance on the street with the most traffic flow, figuratively making it a "corner drugstore" similar to how many independent pharmacies evolved. Some stores have a drive-through pharmacy.[48]
The store management team usually includes a Store Manager (MGR), an Executive Assistant Manager (EXA), and at least one Assistant Manager (MGT). In 2009, Walgreens introduced the Store Team Lead (STL), or "non-management keyholder", position in many of its stores. In 2012, Walgreens announced that they would be phasing out the MGT, EXA, and STL positions for the Assistant Store Manager Trainee (ASM-T), Assistant Store Manager (ASM), and Shift Leader (SFL) positions, respectively. The new management structure will implement a new structure and payscale that will more closely resemble their competitors to reflect the industry standard.
Disability inclusion initiative[edit]
In 2002, Walgreens senior vice president of supply chain and logistics Randy Lewis began a program aimed at providing opportunity to the disabled to work side by side with typical workers. The result was the development and opening of two distribution centers whose staff is approximately 40% disabled. The model was so successful that other companies such as Clarks Companies NA, Glaxo Smith Kline, Best Buy, and Costco have either examined it or placed it under consideration.[49]
Related ventures[edit]




Wag's menu logo circa 1985


Walgreens used to own Sanborns, one of the largest pharmacy and department store chains in Mexico. Walgreens purchased Sanborns from Frank Sanborn in 1946 and sold it to Grupo Carso in 1982.[50]
In the 1980s, Walgreens owned and operated a chain of casual family restaurants/pancake houses called Wag's, an attempt to compete with Woolworth's lunch counters. The Wag's restaurants were very similar in concept to Denny's, IHOP, and Golden Bear. At the highpoint, it had over 100 locations. Walgreens sold most of these to Marriott Corp. in 1988[51] and by 1991, the chain was out of business.
Consumer record[edit]
December 2012, A judge ordered Walgreens to pay $16.57 million to settle a lawsuit. The claim was that over 600 stores were illegally dumping hazardous waste and unlawfully disposing of customer records containing confidential medical information.[52]
Prescriptions[edit]




A Walgreens in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, which opened in 2006.


As of June 2008, Walgreens "agreed to stop altering prescriptions without physician approval as part of a multi-state agreement to settle allegations of improper billing," reported the Knoxville News Sentinel:[53][54]

Walgreens was accused of switching the dosage forms on three medications commonly prescribed for Medicaid patients without doctor approvals in order to boost profits. This resulted in Medicaid programs nationwide paying much more for the medications than they normally would have, according to a press release by the [Tennessee] attorney general's office. Walgreen Co. agreed to comply with state and federal laws on the matter, plus pay $35 million to the federal government, 42 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

"The compliance agreement will be in effect for five years. Walgreens did not admit liability, as part of the settlement," reported the Chicago Sun-Times.[55]
The Walgreens website invited users to write reviews of some OTC products such as vitamins and nutritionals but did not invite users to write reviews of the corresponding Walgreens-branded products. A recent revision of the Walgreens website has added the ability to review any product it sells.
Allegations of discrimination[edit]
In March 2008, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that alleged the company discriminated against African-Americans for $24 million.[56] The settlement was split between the 10,000 African-American employees of the company.[56] In the agreement, Walgreens avoided any admission of guilt.

The decree, one of the largest monetary settlements in a race case by the EEOC, provides for the payment of over $24 million to a class of thousands of African American workers and orders comprehensive injunctive relief designed to improve the company's promotion and store assignment practices.

In September 2011, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which claimed that a store improperly terminated a worker with diabetes for eating a package of the store's food while working to stop a hypoglycemia attack.[57]
Medicaid[edit]
Also, in 2008, Walgreens "agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S., 42 states and Puerto Rico for overcharging state Medicaid programs by filling prescriptions with more expensive dosage forms of ranitidine, a generic form of Zantac and fluoxetine, which is a generic form of Prozac."[58]
In 2009, Walgreens threatened to leave the Medicaid program, the state and federal partnership to provide health insurance coverage to the poor, in Delaware, over reimbursement rates. Walgreens was the largest pharmacy chain in the state and the only chain to make such a threat.[59] The state of Delaware and Walgreens reached an agreement on payment rates and the crisis was averted.[60]
In 2010, Walgreens stopped accepting Medicaid in Washington state, leaving its one million Medicaid recipients unable to get their prescriptions filled at these 121 stores.[61]
On April 20, 2012, the U.S. [Department of Justice] announced, that Walgreens agreed to pay $7.9 million in settlement. The fine relates to allegations of violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act regarding beneficiaries of federal health care programs.[62]
Express Scripts[edit]
In 2011, Walgreens announced it would end its relationship with Express Scripts,[63] a prescription benefits manager. A coalition of minority groups, led by Al Sharpton's National Action Network,[64] sent letters urging CEO Gregory Wasson to reconsider. Groups sending letters were National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference,[65] the Congress of Racial Equality,[66] Hispanic Leadership Fund[67] and others. On July 19, 2012, Walgreens and Express Scripts announced a multi-year pharmacy network agreement that includes rates and terms under which Walgreens would participate in the broadest Express Scripts retail pharmacy network available to new and existing clients as of September 15, 2012.
Use of proprietary drugs[edit]
Walgreens was named in a lawsuit by the Union Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund in the Northern District Court of Illinois in January 2012. The suit alleges Walgreens and Par Pharmaceuticals violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act[68] "at least two widespread schemes to overcharge" for generic drugs.[58]

The lawsuit alleges drugstore chain Walgreen and generic pharmaceutical maker Par established a partnership in which Par manufactured and/or marketed generic versions of antacid Zantac and antidepressant Prozac in dosage forms that weren't subject to private and governmental reimbursement limitations.
It further said Walgreen purchased those dosage forms from par at a cost substantially higher than the widely prescribed dosage forms, and then "systematically and unlawfully filled its customers' prescriptions with Par's more expensive products, rather than the inexpensive dosage forms that were prescribed by physicians."

Distribution of oxycodone[edit]
In September 2012, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of endangering public safety and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, FL a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is "an imminent danger to the public safety." All DEA licensees "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients," said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper."
The Jupiter, Florida distribution center which opened in 2001 is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the single largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said. Over the past three years, its market share has increased, and 52 Walgreens are among the top 100 oxycodone purchasers in the state, the DEA said.[69]
In 2013, United States Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said Walgreens committed "an unprecedented number" of record-keeping and dispensing violations." Walgreens was fined $80 million. At the time, the largest fine in the history of the Controlled Substances Act[70]
Sale of tobacco[edit]
In common with other US pharmacies (a major exception is CVS Pharmacy), Walgreens stocks tobacco products for sale to the public. Some campaigners in the USA advocate the removal of tobacco from pharmacies due to the health risks associated with smoking and the apparent contradiction of selling cigarettes alongside smoking cessation products and asthma medication.[71] Walgreens and other pharmacies who continue to sell tobacco products have been subject to criticism, and attempts have been made to introduce regional bans on the practice, which has taken place in the City and County of San Francisco.[72][73]
Walgreens defends its tobacco sales policy by reasoning that through selling tobacco in its outlets, it is more readily able to offer to customers advice and products for quitting smoking.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Operations[edit]
Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
Walgreens has stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced the purchase of competitor Rite Aid for $17.2 billion.[7]
Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

The Walgreen Company (simply Walgreens, or sometimes archaically Walgreen) is an American company which operates[2] as the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the United States behind CVS Health. It specializes in filling prescriptions, health and wellness products, health information, and photo services.[3] As of August 31, 2016, the company operated 8,175 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1901. The Walgreens headquarters office is in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois.
In 2014, the company agreed to purchase the remaining 55% of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own to form a global business. Under the terms of the purchase, the two companies merged to form a new holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., on December 31, 2014. Walgreens became a subsidiary of the new company, which retains its Deerfield headquarters and trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol WBA.[4]

History[edit]
Company history[edit]




Early "Walgreen Drugs" sign still in use in San Antonio, Texas


Walgreens began in 1901, with a drug store on the corner of Bowen Ave and Cottage Grove in Chicago, owned by Galesburg native Charles R. Walgreen, Sr.[5] By 1913, Walgreens had grown to four stores on Chicago's South Side. It opened its fifth in 1915, and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of alcohol prohibition, the 1920s was a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.[6]
In 1922, the company introduced a malted milkshake, which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid-1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000. Walgreens had expanded into Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.
By 1930, it had 397 stores with annual sales of US$4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.[7] The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression did not greatly affect the company. In 1934, Walgreens was operating in 30 states with 601 stores.
After Charles Walgreen, Sr., died in 1939, his son Charles R. Walgreen took over the chain until his retirement. The Charles R. Walgreen years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles "Cork" R. Walgreen III took over after Walgreen Jr.'s retirement in the early 1950s and modernized the company by switching to barcode scanning. The Walgreen family was not involved in senior management of the company for a short time following Walgreen III's retirement. In 1986, it acquired the MediMart chain from Stop & Shop.[8] In 1995, Kevin P. Walgreen was made a vice-president and promoted to Senior Vice President - Store Operations in 2006.[9]




Walgreens logo until 2006.


On July 12, 2006, David Bernauer stepped down as CEO of Walgreens, replaced by company president Jeff Rein. Holding degrees in accounting and pharmacy from the University of Arizona, Rein was a pharmacist, store manager, district manager, and treasurer prior to being named Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Greg Wasson, former President of Walgreens Health Services, was named President and Chief Operations Officer.
On October 10, 2008, Rein abruptly quit as CEO, replaced by Alan G. McNally as Chairman and Acting CEO.[10]
On January 26, 2009, Gregory Wasson was named CEO, effective February 1, 2009.[11]

August 6, 2014: Walgreens exercised its option to purchase the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots. The combined company is known as the Walgreens Boots Alliance and is headquartered in Chicago.[23][24]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire its rival Rite Aid for $9 per share, a deal valued at $9.4 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal will result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[25] In response to being able to receive approval, Walgreens said that it would be willing to divest up to 1,000 stores to win regulatory approval for its Rite Aid purchase.[26] Walgreens and Rite Aid, combined, own approximately 200 million square feet of retail space in addition to 21 million square feet of office and warehouse space. The two chains operate 12,900 stores in the United States. Walgreens operates 13,100 stores across 11 countries. Walgreens CEO has stated that there is potentially over $1 billion in savings to be reaped from the merger through synergies.[27] On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 Million USD for antitrust reasons.[28] In January 2017, Walgreens reached a deal to lower the price of the acquisition from $9.4 to $6.8-$7.4 billion and delayed the closing by six months.[29] On June 29, 2017, Walgreens announced that it would drop its original plan to acquire Rite Aid due to resistance from federal regulators, and would instead buy about half of Rite Aid's existing stores for $5.18 billion in cash. [30]Under the terms of the agreement, Walgreens will acquire 2,186 stores, 3 distribution centers, and other Rite Aid inventory[31]. The stores are expected to be converted from Rite Aid stores into Walgreens stores, making Walgreens the largest drug-store chain by number of locations in the U.S. with over 10,200 stores.[32] The company also agreed to pay Rite Aid a $325 million fee for ending the earlier merger agreements.[33] The new deal is expected to close within the next 6 months, pending regulatory approval. [34]


July 28, 2016, Walgreens announced it would shut down Drugstore.com, as well as Beauty.com, in order to focus on its own Walgreens.com website.[35]

Contributions to popular culture[edit]
Walgreens claims credit for the popularization of the malted milkshake (or at least its version of the malted milkshake), invented by Ivar "Pop" Coulson in 1922,[36] although milkshakes and malted milk had been around for some time before. This development coincided with the invention of the electric blender in the same year.
In November 2010, Walgreens filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Wegmans supermarket chain, claiming the "W" in the Wegman's logo is too similar to Walgreens'.[37] The lawsuit was settled in April 2011, with Wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its "W" logo by June 2012, although the supermarket retains the right to use the “Wegmans” name in script.[38] According to Jo Natale, Wegmans director of media relations, “The cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end.”[39]
The logo for the Washington Nationals baseball team is similar to the Walgreens "W";[40] to date, Walgreens never challenged the Nationals' use of their "W" in a lawsuit.
Corporate operations[edit]
Walgreens has its corporate headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois.[41][42] As of 2009, Walgreens employed 5,200 people at its headquarters.[43]
In 1987, Walgreens employed about 1,100 people at its headquarters, which was at the time in an unincorporated area on the west side of Deerfield.[44][45] As of 2000, headquarters was still in an unincorporated area in West Deerfield Township.[46]
In the summer of 2014, a corporate relocation to Switzerland was considered as part of a merger with Alliance Boots, a European drugstore chain.[47] This drew controversy as many consumers felt that it was an attempt at tax inversion. On August 5, 2014, Walgreens announced that they would not be relocating their headquarters.
Store model[edit]




A Walgreens on Rt.1 South, Saugus, Massachusetts.


Walgreens stores were originally connected to local groceries. In Chicago, their flagship market, they teamed up with either Eagle Food Centers or Dominick's Finer Foods, usually with a "walkthru" to the adjoining store and often sharing personnel. This concept was instated to compete with the popular dual store format used by chief competitor Jewel-Osco/Albertsons-Sav-On. They eventually ended the relationship with Eagle and focused primarily on a connection to the Dominick's stores. PharmX-Rexall filled the vacated Walgreen locations joined to Eagle stores.




A Walgreens "corner drugstore", located in a Marriott street-level retail space, on the corner of a heavily trafficked intersection in Washington, D.C


In its 2009 business model, Walgreens are freestanding corner stores, with the entrance on the street with the most traffic flow, figuratively making it a "corner drugstore" similar to how many independent pharmacies evolved. Some stores have a drive-through pharmacy.[48]
The store management team usually includes a Store Manager (MGR), an Executive Assistant Manager (EXA), and at least one Assistant Manager (MGT). In 2009, Walgreens introduced the Store Team Lead (STL), or "non-management keyholder", position in many of its stores. In 2012, Walgreens announced that they would be phasing out the MGT, EXA, and STL positions for the Assistant Store Manager Trainee (ASM-T), Assistant Store Manager (ASM), and Shift Leader (SFL) positions, respectively. The new management structure will implement a new structure and payscale that will more closely resemble their competitors to reflect the industry standard.
Disability inclusion initiative[edit]
In 2002, Walgreens senior vice president of supply chain and logistics Randy Lewis began a program aimed at providing opportunity to the disabled to work side by side with typical workers. The result was the development and opening of two distribution centers whose staff is approximately 40% disabled. The model was so successful that other companies such as Clarks Companies NA, Glaxo Smith Kline, Best Buy, and Costco have either examined it or placed it under consideration.[49]
Related ventures[edit]




Wag's menu logo circa 1985


Walgreens used to own Sanborns, one of the largest pharmacy and department store chains in Mexico. Walgreens purchased Sanborns from Frank Sanborn in 1946 and sold it to Grupo Carso in 1982.[50]
In the 1980s, Walgreens owned and operated a chain of casual family restaurants/pancake houses called Wag's, an attempt to compete with Woolworth's lunch counters. The Wag's restaurants were very similar in concept to Denny's, IHOP, and Golden Bear. At the highpoint, it had over 100 locations. Walgreens sold most of these to Marriott Corp. in 1988[51] and by 1991, the chain was out of business.
Consumer record[edit]
December 2012, A judge ordered Walgreens to pay $16.57 million to settle a lawsuit. The claim was that over 600 stores were illegally dumping hazardous waste and unlawfully disposing of customer records containing confidential medical information.[52]
Prescriptions[edit]




A Walgreens in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, which opened in 2006.


As of June 2008, Walgreens "agreed to stop altering prescriptions without physician approval as part of a multi-state agreement to settle allegations of improper billing," reported the Knoxville News Sentinel:[53][54]

Walgreens was accused of switching the dosage forms on three medications commonly prescribed for Medicaid patients without doctor approvals in order to boost profits. This resulted in Medicaid programs nationwide paying much more for the medications than they normally would have, according to a press release by the [Tennessee] attorney general's office. Walgreen Co. agreed to comply with state and federal laws on the matter, plus pay $35 million to the federal government, 42 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

"The compliance agreement will be in effect for five years. Walgreens did not admit liability, as part of the settlement," reported the Chicago Sun-Times.[55]
The Walgreens website invited users to write reviews of some OTC products such as vitamins and nutritionals but did not invite users to write reviews of the corresponding Walgreens-branded products. A recent revision of the Walgreens website has added the ability to review any product it sells.
Allegations of discrimination[edit]
In March 2008, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that alleged the company discriminated against African-Americans for $24 million.[56] The settlement was split between the 10,000 African-American employees of the company.[56] In the agreement, Walgreens avoided any admission of guilt.

The decree, one of the largest monetary settlements in a race case by the EEOC, provides for the payment of over $24 million to a class of thousands of African American workers and orders comprehensive injunctive relief designed to improve the company's promotion and store assignment practices.

In September 2011, Walgreens settled a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which claimed that a store improperly terminated a worker with diabetes for eating a package of the store's food while working to stop a hypoglycemia attack.[57]
Medicaid[edit]
Also, in 2008, Walgreens "agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S., 42 states and Puerto Rico for overcharging state Medicaid programs by filling prescriptions with more expensive dosage forms of ranitidine, a generic form of Zantac and fluoxetine, which is a generic form of Prozac."[58]
In 2009, Walgreens threatened to leave the Medicaid program, the state and federal partnership to provide health insurance coverage to the poor, in Delaware, over reimbursement rates. Walgreens was the largest pharmacy chain in the state and the only chain to make such a threat.[59] The state of Delaware and Walgreens reached an agreement on payment rates and the crisis was averted.[60]
In 2010, Walgreens stopped accepting Medicaid in Washington state, leaving its one million Medicaid recipients unable to get their prescriptions filled at these 121 stores.[61]
On April 20, 2012, the U.S. [Department of Justice] announced, that Walgreens agreed to pay $7.9 million in settlement. The fine relates to allegations of violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act regarding beneficiaries of federal health care programs.[62]
Express Scripts[edit]
In 2011, Walgreens announced it would end its relationship with Express Scripts,[63] a prescription benefits manager. A coalition of minority groups, led by Al Sharpton's National Action Network,[64] sent letters urging CEO Gregory Wasson to reconsider. Groups sending letters were National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference,[65] the Congress of Racial Equality,[66] Hispanic Leadership Fund[67] and others. On July 19, 2012, Walgreens and Express Scripts announced a multi-year pharmacy network agreement that includes rates and terms under which Walgreens would participate in the broadest Express Scripts retail pharmacy network available to new and existing clients as of September 15, 2012.
Use of proprietary drugs[edit]
Walgreens was named in a lawsuit by the Union Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund in the Northern District Court of Illinois in January 2012. The suit alleges Walgreens and Par Pharmaceuticals violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act[68] "at least two widespread schemes to overcharge" for generic drugs.[58]

The lawsuit alleges drugstore chain Walgreen and generic pharmaceutical maker Par established a partnership in which Par manufactured and/or marketed generic versions of antacid Zantac and antidepressant Prozac in dosage forms that weren't subject to private and governmental reimbursement limitations.
It further said Walgreen purchased those dosage forms from par at a cost substantially higher than the widely prescribed dosage forms, and then "systematically and unlawfully filled its customers' prescriptions with Par's more expensive products, rather than the inexpensive dosage forms that were prescribed by physicians."

Distribution of oxycodone[edit]
In September 2012, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of endangering public safety and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, FL a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is "an imminent danger to the public safety." All DEA licensees "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients," said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper."
The Jupiter, Florida distribution center which opened in 2001 is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the single largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said. Over the past three years, its market share has increased, and 52 Walgreens are among the top 100 oxycodone purchasers in the state, the DEA said.[69]
In 2013, United States Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said Walgreens committed "an unprecedented number" of record-keeping and dispensing violations." Walgreens was fined $80 million. At the time, the largest fine in the history of the Controlled Substances Act[70]
Sale of tobacco[edit]
In common with other US pharmacies (a major exception is CVS Pharmacy), Walgreens stocks tobacco products for sale to the public. Some campaigners in the USA advocate the removal of tobacco from pharmacies due to the health risks associated with smoking and the apparent contradiction of selling cigarettes alongside smoking cessation products and asthma medication.[71] Walgreens and other pharmacies who continue to sell tobacco products have been subject to criticism, and attempts have been made to introduce regional bans on the practice, which has taken place in the City and County of San Francisco.[72][73]
Walgreens defends its tobacco sales policy by reasoning that through selling tobacco in its outlets, it is more readily able to offer to customers advice and products for quitting smoking.

There are more than 400 minor care health clinics across the country located right inside Walgreens retail locations. They offer flu shots, drug testing and other minor care procedures. An office visit at Walgreens Take Care Clinic costs $80-$90. The prices for various treatments, procedures and testing are not included and will vary, depending on what the physician orders. 

If you're wondering how much are flu shots at Walgreens, they're about $32 per dose for ages 2 and over. There are also other flu shot alternatives at Walgreens – like the FluMist spray and FluZone. For more information, see Flu Shots at Walgreens. 

Walgreens sells over-the-counter drug testing kits that can be used at home or sent off to a manufacturer's lab for the results. Prices vary, depending on the type of test you choose - from $8 to $140. 
 Walgreens Photo Services

Prints and enlargements at Walgreens start at just $.12 each. They offer discounts on print orders up to 50% off and also have regular coupons available for their photo services as well. They also have coupons and discounts for greeting cards, print gifts, Photo gift orders, and other specialty photo products. 

Passport photos at Walgreens cost $11.99 per set and are available for same day pickup at most locations. To find out more about Walgreens Passport Photos, see How Much Are Passport Photos at Walmart?
 Other Walgreens Services

Most Walgreens locations sell full stamp booklets only. Be sure to call in advance to see if your local store is one of them. 

Walgreens carries a wide range of gift cards for department stores, restaurants and online retailers. The selection may vary between stores. They also sell select gift cards online and offer free shipping on gift card orders over $25. 
What Walgreens Coupons Exist?

Stock up on household staples and wellness items and save money with Walgreens promo codes. Most Walgreens coupon codes are for discounts on specific services, like Walgreens photo lab. During the holidays, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Walgreens will feature discounts for holiday decor, gifts, toys, Christmas card and a whole array of personalized photo gifts. You may also find Walgreens discounts on specific brands, like Revlon, L’Oreal or Huggies.

 About Walgreens

Walgreens started out as a small family owned corner pharmacy on the South Side of Chicago in 1901.Charles R. Walgreen Sr. mixed and marketed his own brand of drugs at the pharmacy to ensure quality and low prices for his customers.  By 1919, Walgreens had expanded to include a chain of 20 stores. During Prohibition when many merchants were losing money on the alcohol band, Walgreens was having great financial success because prescription whiskey was still legal – and they were the only stores that carried it. 

By 1930, Walgreens boasted nearly 400 stores across four states and annual sales of over $4 million. Over the years, the Walgreens empire continued to grow as the company changed hands within the family many times. By the 1950s, Walgreens revolutionized the way consumers shopped by introducing barcode scanning and self-serve checkout lines. 

Between 1984 and 1994, Walgreens opened a staggering 1,000 additional stores. In 1999, the company launched their website and online pharmacy and celebrated the opening of their 3,000th store the next year. Today, the Walgreens Empire includes 8,206 stores across the US. The Walgreens brand also operates several well-known Internet pharmacy brands, such as Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
