Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

This firm’s lawyers do not have peer reviews.


*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Testimonials or endorsements in any review do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Pelham attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline
Find out whether an attorney has ever been disciplined.
