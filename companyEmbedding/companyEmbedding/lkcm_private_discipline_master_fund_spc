 FORT WORTH, Texas -- Luther King Capital Management Corporation
announced today that an affiliated investment partnership, LKCM Private
Discipline Master Fund, SPC, has made a competing proposal to the Board
of Directors of Industrial Distribution Group, Inc. (IDG) to acquire all
outstanding shares of IDG common stock at a purchase price of $11.70 per
share in cash. The proposal represents a 13.6% premium to the $10.30 per
share cash offer of Platinum Equity and its affiliates previously
accepted by IDG.

 LKCM believes that its proposal will maximize value for IDG
stockholders, and it has requested to meet with IDG's Board of
Directors as soon as possible to discuss the proposal.

 The text of the letter sent to IDG's Board of Directors
follows:

 April 4, 2008


Richard M. Seigel
Chairman of the Board of Directors
Industrial Distribution Group, Inc.
950 East Paces Ferry Road

Suite 1575
Atlanta, Georgia 30326

c/o W. Randy Eaddy, Esq.
Kilpatrick Stockton LLP
1001 West Fourth Street
Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101
 Dear Mr. Seigel:

 As you are aware, LKCM Private Discipline Master Fund, SPC and its
affiliates ("LKCM" or "we") beneficially own
approximately 14.9% of the outstanding common stock of Industrial
Distribution Group, Inc. ("IDG"). On behalf of LKCM, I am
pleased to submit this proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of IDG
common stock in a transaction that provides IDG stockholders with value
that is superior to the proposed transaction with Platinum Equity and
its affiliates ("Platinum").

 We propose to acquire all outstanding shares of IDG common stock at
a price of $11.70 per share in cash. Subject to satisfactory completion
of due diligence, we would execute a definitive agreement covering our
proposal. We would be willing to execute a definitive agreement in
substantially the same form as IDG's agreement with Platinum, and
thus do not anticipate any delay in negotiations. No closing conditions,
other than those required for the Platinum transaction, would be
necessary to consummate our proposed transaction with IDG. Our proposal
will not be subject to a financing condition.

 We are prepared to commence due diligence expeditiously, assuming
that we are granted full access to IDG due diligence materials and
receive cooperation from IDG management. As contemplated by the
agreement for the Platinum transaction, we are willing to execute an
appropriate confidentiality agreement in connection with any proprietary
information we may receive from IDG.

 We are enthusiastic about a transaction with IDG and believe that
our proposal will enable the Board of Directors to maximize value for
IDG stockholders.

 We would like to meet with the Board of Directors as soon as
possible to discuss our superior proposal. You may contact us at (817)
332-3235. We look forward to your prompt response.

 Sincerely,

 /s/ J. Bryan King


J. Bryan King, CFA
LKCM Private Discipline Master Fund, SPC

OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY
