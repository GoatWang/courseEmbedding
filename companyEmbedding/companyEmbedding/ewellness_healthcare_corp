DID YOU KNOW?For current and responsible information about lymphedema and its treatment, the National Lymphedema Network (NLN) is an invaluable resource. This highly respected non-profit organization has assembled an expert Medical Advisory Committee which composes Position Papers to guide patients and professionals in making sound medical decisions.





Available Hand Compression Garment ManufacturersBSN JobstFarrow MedicalJuzoLympheDIVAsLympheDUDEsMediSolarisSolideaSelect a manufacturer for available products.

Compression Gauntlets & Gloves
At Lymphedema Products, we carry an extensive line of compression gloves for the control of swelling and discomfort in the hand(s). Options range from the somewhat ordinary (Solidea Active Massage Gauntlet, or various versions of the Mediven Harmony Gauntlet, by Medi), to the striking (Juzo Soft Print series; LympheDIVAs and LympheDUDEs gauntlets or gloves). Whatever your style inclination, or your medical need, you're sure to find a glove/gauntlet to meet your specific needs. Gloves provide coverage for the entire hand and thumb, with cutouts for the fingertips. Gauntlets tend to provide coverage from the wrist to the knuckles, with a cutout for the thumb.
Options include a range of products featuring different types of coverage. These high-quality therapeutic products feature a variety of materials, including specialized fabrics, and careful construction techniques. For example, at the eye-catching end of the spectrum we offer gloves and gauntlets by LympheDIVAs and LympheDUDEs. These items feature bright, colorful fabrics in fanciful prints, such as "cyborg," "inked," "peacock," or "kraken." You'll definitely make a fashion statement whenever you wear these bold, exciting prints.
But there's more to these fabrics than mere visual appeal. These fun fabrics also breathe and allow for 360 degrees of stretch, providing greater comfort and range of motion. With moisture-wicking technology built into the fabric, your skin will stay cooler longer when wearing these medical-grade compression garments. Seamless knit construction means these gloves fit like a second skin. Wear them to reduce lymphedema on your doctor's advice, or simply don a pair to help improve athletic performance and reduce muscle fatigue.

Home / Bandages







•























DID YOU KNOW?Lymphedema bandages are referred to as short stretch because when compared to a traditional ace bandage, they only stretch an additional 50% of their length. A typical ace bandage can stretch up to an additional 300% of its length. Short stretch bandages contain no rubber threads so they generate comfortable, safer pressures. Because short stretch bandages do not contain rubber, they do not create any of the typical constriction problems associated with highly elastic bandages.





Available Bandage CategoriesShort StretchMedium StretchStockinettesFinger and Toe WrapsFoam AffixingPaddingStrapping/BracingAdhesiveSelect a category for available products.

Compression Bandage and Wrap Options
Compression bandages are the most simple and foundational form of passive lymphedema control. Bandages have been used for centuries to protect and promote wound healing. But our modern compression bandages are a far cry from the strips of linen employed by healers in centuries past. Our bandages capitalize on the availability of a broad range of modern, high-tech materials and closures to ensure a snug fit, cleanliness, convenience, effectiveness, and enhances lymphatic drainage. With our products, your body can heal naturally.
Options range from ultra-simple (short-stretch compression bandages in 100% cotton) to more complex (such as our NuStim wrap, which features a nylon/Lycra blend in the outer layer, and a patented inner foam layer; or SuperWrap, which has a multi-directional elasticity and adjustable compression that's "non-migratory" - meaning it stays put with minimal fuss). You'll find everything from classic gauze bandages to fabrics with one-way stretch and self-adhesion in our collection.
Remember the old days when spiked metal clamps had to hold elasticized bandages together? These days, most bandages feature reusable velcro closures and/or self-adhering properties to help keep bandages firmly in place with little to no slippage. Most fabrics are cool, comfortable, and breathable. Some are even washable. Due to the minimal risk of allergies, many bandages are also latex-free.
We offer anatomically designed bandages and wraps for various areas of the body, including fingers, toes, feet, hands, and legs. Stockinettes, for example, come in seamless tubular designs that grip your calf, ankle, and foot, providing a comfortable, breathable, shape-retaining under-layer that's easy on the skin, while allowing additional layering of compression wear, as needed.
Choose from our many diverse bandages to achieve the perfect blend of hypo-allergenicity, flexibility, compression, wearability, durability, and affordability. Let the healing begin!

DID YOU KNOW?Many surgical techniques designed to treat/cure lymphedema have been attempted by well-intentioned doctors throughout the world. Currently no surgical method is recommended. Patients should be extremely cautious about purported surgical solutions and should always contact a Certified Lymphedema Therapist to discuss safe and effective therapy options.

Compression Gauntlets & Gloves
At Lymphedema Products, we carry an extensive line of compression gloves for the control of swelling and discomfort in the hand(s). Options range from the somewhat ordinary (Solidea Active Massage Gauntlet, or various versions of the Mediven Harmony Gauntlet, by Medi), to the striking (Juzo Soft Print series; LympheDIVAs and LympheDUDEs gauntlets or gloves). Whatever your style inclination, or your medical need, you're sure to find a glove/gauntlet to meet your specific needs. Gloves provide coverage for the entire hand and thumb, with cutouts for the fingertips. Gauntlets tend to provide coverage from the wrist to the knuckles, with a cutout for the thumb.
Options include a range of products featuring different types of coverage. These high-quality therapeutic products feature a variety of materials, including specialized fabrics, and careful construction techniques. For example, at the eye-catching end of the spectrum we offer gloves and gauntlets by LympheDIVAs and LympheDUDEs. These items feature bright, colorful fabrics in fanciful prints, such as "cyborg," "inked," "peacock," or "kraken." You'll definitely make a fashion statement whenever you wear these bold, exciting prints.
But there's more to these fabrics than mere visual appeal. These fun fabrics also breathe and allow for 360 degrees of stretch, providing greater comfort and range of motion. With moisture-wicking technology built into the fabric, your skin will stay cooler longer when wearing these medical-grade compression garments. Seamless knit construction means these gloves fit like a second skin. Wear them to reduce lymphedema on your doctor's advice, or simply don a pair to help improve athletic performance and reduce muscle fatigue.

Available Knee-High Compression Garment ManufacturersBSN JobstJuzoMediSigvarisSolarisSelect a manufacturer for available products.

Compression Knee-Highs
We stock a wide range of medical-grade knee high compression garments, from trusted manufacturer, BSN Jobst. Options run the gamut from casual and active wear stockings for both men and women, to sheer support hose for women. Other items are designed to address specific concerns, such as ulcer prevention or treatment, or the formation of potentially dangerous embolisms.
Some of these stockings are easy on the budget, getting the job done with little fuss, for an affordable price. Others focus on comfort, while emphasizing style and visual appeal. Jobst Ultrasheer Medical Legwear in Diamond Pattern, is an example of this happy marriage between function and fashion. Available in two color choices, these stockings are lightweight and attractive for everyday or office wear, while still supplying medical-grade compression. With these stylish stockings, it's unlikely anyone will suspect you're wearing compression hosiery.
BSN Jobst also carries various selections for men, including forMen Medical Legwear. Available in several colors, and three grades of medical compression, these knee-high stockings are appropriate for dress or everyday wear. Worn under slacks, it's unlikely anyone will ever suspect that these fashionable sock-like garments are actually working to help prevent fatigue and prevent fluid accumulation. Choose from open-toe or closed-toe stockings.
For weekend warriors who desire a slight edge, we offer Jobst ActiveWear stockings. These energizing athletic socks help massage the muscles of the calves and ankles, to enhance circulation and help reduce inappropriate fluid accumulation. Available in a range of medical grade compression levels.

DID YOU KNOW?Elastic garments follow a classification system according to strength of pressure. Compression Class (CCL) is a European system that standardizes compression, allowing therapists and patients obtain garments of a given compression regardless of brand. The United States does not have its own system so the European system is used instead.

See the APP for iOS devices on the following link: Phzio on the App Store The PHZIO app will dramatically increase the ability of Physical Therapy Practices to engage with and treat patients using the PHZIO Telehealth Platform, while patents will be given significantly greater flexibility for engaging with their Physical Therapist.Any patient with a modern iOS or Android device (iPhone, iPad, Android phone or tablet) will be able to get a physical therapy treatment anywhere they are while being monitoring in real-time by a PT. This will vastly increase the population of treatable patients that can use the PHZIO solution. It is currently estimated that there are approximately 190 million smartphone users within the US.eWellness will initially rollout the solution within California, New York and Virginia, with plans to expand nationally over the next 3-6 months.Further, eWellness will also seek to engage with the "At-Home" Physical Therapy treatment market. This market involves physical therapy practitioners treating patients in their home instead of a clinic. The "At-Home" market model when combined with PHZIO offers patients and practitioners a means to receive and deliver PT services without having to leave work during normal business hours. Patients will be able to get physical therapy services at almost any hour of the day. A model that is not currently employed within traditional clinical settings.Mr. Darwin Fogt, CEO said "We are excited to introduce this new PHZIO App. This tool can revolutionize how physical therapy is delivered while tapping into the scale and reach of an Uber-style business model.About eWellnesseWellness Healthcare Corporation (  OTCQB :  EWLL ) is the first physical therapy telehealth company to offer insurance reimbursable real-time distance monitored treatments. Our business model is to license our PHZIO ("PHZIO") platform to any physical therapy ("PT") clinic in the U.S. and or have large-scale employers use our PHZIO platform as a fully PT monitored corporate wellness program. The Company's PHZIO home physical therapy exercise platform has been designed to disrupt the $30 billion physical therapy and the $8 billion corporate wellness industries. PHZIO re-defines the way physical therapy can be delivered. PHZIO is the first real-time remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy platform for home use. Due to the real-time patient monitoring feature, the PHZIO platform is insurance reimbursable by payers such as: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.The PHZIO Solution: A New Physical Therapy Delivery SystemSaaS technology platform solution for providers bundling rehabilitation  services and employer wellness programs;  First real-time remote monitored 1-to-many physical therapy  treatment platform for home use;  Ability for physical therapists to observe multiple patients  simultaneously in real-time;  Solves what has been a structural problem and limitation in  post-acute care practice growth; and  Allows PT practices to generate increased revenues due to  higher adherence and compliance rates.http://www.ewellnesshealth.com/ http://phzio.com/Safe Harbor Statement"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) regarding us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We will not receive any net proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock
being registered for resale by the Selling Stockholders named in this
prospectus.

We may, however, receive proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common
stock upon the exercise of the Warrants.

If all of the outstanding Warrants were exercised for cash at an exercise price
of approximately $0.35 per share (subject to adjustment), we could receive up to
a total of approximately $483,417. However, the holders of Warrants are only
obligated to exercise such warrants for cash if the underlying Warrant Shares
have been registered for resale under a current registration statement declared
effective by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and there can
be no guarantee they will exercise any Warrants.

We intend to use any proceeds we may receive from the cash exercise of the
Warrants for working capital and other general corporate purposes. There is no
assurance that any or all of the Warrants will ever be exercised or that
additional shares underlying the Warrants will be registered for resale.


To date, we have not identified any other program that is designed to provide
Distance Monitored Physical Therapy Telemedicine Program that has been
specifically designed to help prevent pre-diabetic patients from becoming
diabetic. Although we compete against typical brick and mortar physical therapy
practices, they are limited significantly by the number of patients that can be
seen in an 8 hour shift and do not offer any telemedicine products. The national
average is approximately 16 patients per day per Physical Therapist (“PT”) or PT
assistant (“PTA”). Once we launch our DMpt services, our PTs and PTAs are
anticipated to be as high as 137 patients per day. We anticipate being able to
deliver up to 850% more patient volume per PT and PTA. Additionally, existing
telemedicine physical therapy businesses do create and sell exercise videos, but
such business is not insurance reimbursable and there is little patient
engagement. Accordingly, we believe that we are first-to-market with the
innovative service and program we seek to provide.


Company Description
eWellness was incorporated in Nevada in May 2013. Following a share exchange we
completed in April 2014, pursuant to which eWellness Corporation, a Nevada
corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary, we abandoned our prior business
plan and we are now pursuing eWellness Corporation’s historical


 businesses and
proposed businesses. Our historical business and operations will continue
independently. eWellness is an early-stage Los Angeles based medical technology
company that combines digital physical therapy with progressive in-home exercise
programs that includes active real-time monitoring and assessment by physical
therapists. Our services are provisioned through our Distance Monitored Physical
Therapy (DMpt) Program utilizing our proprietary WWW.PHZIO.COM telemedicine
platform initially to pre-diabetic, cardiac and health challenged patients,
through contracted physician practices and healthcare systems and in-office
visits. Based on today’s insurance landscape, our main revenue source shall come
from a combination of in-office and telemedicine visits. Amid ongoing challenges
and changes within the healthcare industry, telemedicine is emerging as an
increasingly attractive tool for delivering quality medical services.

As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have one patient who is fully
monitored on our WWW.PHZIO.COM platform with limited insurance reimbursement to
date; however, our WWW.PHZIO.COM platform is fully operational, we have
completed an 8-week patient in-house study in Los Angeles and as of April 29,
2015 we are provisioning our WWW.PHZIO.COM program to patients in Los Angeles
through a cooperation agreement with Evolution Physical Therapy (“EPT”).

To date, we have not identified any other program that is designed to provide
insurance reimbursable Distance Monitored Physical Therapy Telemedicine that has
been specifically designed to help prevent pre-diabetic patients from becoming
diabetic and therefore believe that once adequately funded, we will be the first
to market with our specific innovative service and program. Our program combines
in-office direct-contact physical therapy evaluations, re-evaluations and
physical performance testing with an on-line telemedicine exercise program. This
business model allows us to bill for traditional in-office patient visits and
when insurance companies allow, for our telemedicine exercise program sessions
too. We also intend to offer to enroll our patients in a no-cost online healthy
living nutrition and meal planning platform to be developed in the second
quarter of 2015.

Assuming we receive sufficient financing to do so, we intend to start servicing
patients in the second fiscal quarter of 2015 in the Los Angeles metropolitan
area, when we also anticipate rolling out our WWW.PHZIO.COM platform. As an
innovator of certain services, we are aware that the proposed DMpt services will
be launched in an industry with deeply established and regulated billing
approaches. For this reason, we designed a business model to succeed in the
current billing environment by anticipating that the only reimbursement
available to us for the next three years will be generated by using procedures
and codes that insurance providers currently accept, even though we believe
insurance companies will start providing more telemedicine reimbursement prior
to such time given its benefits. Currently, depending on each patient’s
insurance coverage, existing codes cover up to 14 in-office visits and/or up to
24 remotely monitored physical therapy sessions during our six-month program.
Today, some insurance companies do not reimburse for any physical therapy
sessions, whether or not they are monitored, and none of the insurance companies
within our patient base provide codes that reimburse non-monitored physical
therapy sessions. Our plans and goals factor in these non-reimbursed sessions as
part of the overall Cost of Goods Sold (COGS); we still believe that we can earn
revenues and generate profit based solely on the services for which insurance
companies currently provide reimbursement. In light of current insurance
practices, we configured four separate reimbursement plans designed to maximize
the needs of today’s patient base. Our DMpt system is currently configured to
deliver a six-month therapy program with at least three sessions per week using
a combination of 78 remote monitored and/or remote non-monitored therapy
sessions and 6 to 26 in-office visits (number of office visits depend on
insurance coverage). This assures us that we will be able to deliver a
consistent service to the patients and achieve our internal operating goals
without any innovation in the insurance industry codes. While the current,
somewhat archaic, reimbursement standards do not reimburse for some aspects of
our six month program, based upon feedback from industry leaders, we believe
that the regulatory and insurance environment is trending towards a payment
structure that will be more favorable to remote monitored and non-monitored
programs within the telemedicine sphere, although there can be no guarantee such
trend will be realized. Part of our current plan is to compile six months of
compelling patient outcomes in the form of a clinical study, to submit to the
insurance agencies to encourage the trend towards remote-services based
reimbursement and enhance our reimbursement opportunities. Regardless, our
business model suggests that we will be able to generate revenues and sustain a
profitable business; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to
generate any revenues or realize any profits, as we have yet to launch any of
our services. If the insurance industry recognizes the advantages telemedicine
can provide to patients, medical professionals and insurance companies, and then
more readily provides reimbursement for same, we will stand to earn significant
more revenues.
                                                                           
Our Distance Monitored Physical Therapy (“DMpt”) program, including: design,
testing, exercise intervention, follow-up, and exercise demonstration, has been
developed by accomplished Los Angeles based physical therapist Darwin Fogt. Mr.
Fogt has extensive experience and education working with diverse populations
from professional athletes to morbidly obese. He understands the most beneficial
exercise prescription to achieve optimal results and has had great success in
motivating all patient types to stay consistent in working toward their goals.
Additionally, his methods have proven effective and safe as he demonstrates
exercises with attention to proper form to avoid injury. Mr. Fogt has
established himself as a national leader in his field and has successfully
implemented progressive solutions to delivering physical therapy: he has
consulted with and been published by numerous national publications including
Runner’s World, Men’s Health, Men’s Journal, and various Physical Therapy
specific magazines; his 13 plus years of experience include rehabilitating the
general population, as well as professional athletes, Olympic gold medalists,
and celebrities. He has bridged the gap between physical therapy and fitness by
opening EPT, which uses licensed physical therapists to teach high intensity
circuit training fitness classes. He also founded one of the first exclusive
prenatal and postnatal physical therapy clinic in the country. Mr. Fogt is a
leader in advancing the profession to incorporate research-based methods and
focus on, not only rehabilitation but also wellness, functional fitness,
performance, and prevention. He is able to recognize that the national
healthcare structure (federal and private insurance) is moving toward a model of
prevention and that the physical therapy profession will take a larger role in
providing wellness services to patients.
