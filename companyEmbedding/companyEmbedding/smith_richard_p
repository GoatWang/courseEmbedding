Richard P. Smith













                    
                    Richard P. Smith is an award winning outdoor writer and photographer living in the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan who has been hunting whitetail deer and black bear for almost 50 years. The author/photographer is a recognized expert on whitetail deer and black bear behavior and biology as well as hunting these popular big game animals. He has interviewed the top bear biologists in the country and accompanied them in the field on their research. A number of the books he's written and DVDs he's produced have been about deer and black bear.Over the past year, Smith has spent countless hours filming whitetail deer behavior with a high definition video camera and has captured some unique clips of deer eating mushrooms, a doe nursing her fawn, velvet shedding, bucks fighting, buck and doe breeding activity, the reaction of a buck losing his antlers and much, much more.Richard’s book,the 4th Edition of Deer Hunting, won the first place award in the book division from the Michigan Outdoor Writers Association in 2013.One of his more prestigious honors was receipt of the coveted Ben East Prize for 1997 from the Michigan United Conservation Clubs for conservation journalism about bear management. He also received the Outdoor Journalist of the Year Award from the Flint, Michigan Chapter of Safari Club International the same year.Smith is a nationally recognized writer, photographer and speaker who has written 26 books and thousands of magazine articles, specializing in all types of wildlife, but especially whitetail deer and black bear. He contributes regularly to Michigan Sportsman Magazine, Woods-N-Water News and Michigan Outdoor News. He's a field editor for Bear Hunters Online, Bear Hunting Magazine and Michigan Hooks & Bullets. His writing and photography appear regularly in national magazines including Deer & Deer Hunting, Buckmasters, North American Whitetail, Outdoor Life, Bowhunter and National Wildlife.During recent years, the videographer has completed two popular DVDs. One is titled Field Judging Black Bears, a subject he's an expert on, and the second is Walking With Whitetails, both of which are available from Amazon.During the spring of 2002, Richard bagged a huge black bear in Saskatchewan with a .45 caliber Knight Super Disc Muzzleloader that is the second highest scoring black bear in national muzzleloading records maintained by the Longhunter Society. The bruin's skull officially measures 21 14/16, also qualifying for a spot in Boone and Crockett Records. He was hunting out of Lone Wolf Camp operated by Brian and Shelly MacDonald when he got the trophy bear. A full mount of the animal is on display at a Cabela's Store in Hamburg, Pennsylvania that opened in 2003.Richard's biggest whitetail bucks have been bagged in Saskatchewan, too, while hunting with Proudfoot Creek Outfitters. He shot a 13-point nontypical that had a gross score of 171 3/8 while hunting out of that camp during the fall of 2010.He is the second person in Michigan to collect a CBM Grand Slam. To complete such a feat, a hunter must shoot deer, bear, elk and turkey that qualify for listing in state records maintained by Commemorative Bucks of Michigan (CBM). It took Smith a lifetime of hunting in the state to achieve the goal. His slam was completed on November 3, 2000 when he bagged a turkey that qualified for CBM records.The head mount of a snarling black bear that Smith shot with bow and arrow during 1974 plays a prominent role in the movie "Escanaba In Da Moonlight." The movie was filmed in and near Escanaba, Michigan during 2000 and began showing in Michigan theaters during February of 2001 and is now available on DVD and video. A screen-filling image of the bear head appears near the beginning of the movie as well as in a number of later scenes as it hangs on the hunting camp wall depicted in the film.

I have no words to describe my experience. I needed a double tooth extraction and I've never been more impressed. First of all the amazing lady at the front desk called my insurance to make sure they covered the procedure. Then she made me an appointment and even called me when they want a cancellation to see it I wanted the spot. The dentist and his tech were phenomenal. I felt so well taken care of! I wasn't a walking check. I was a patient who needed excellent care and I got that and more. He made sure I felt no pain at all. He was so courteous and so senitive to my needs. I was in excellent hands. I recommend them to anyone who is tired of feeling like a money bag and low quality customer care. I promise you won't be disappointed. Honestly I fail you understand the negative reviews. The amazing care started as soon as I walked in and all the way to the very end as they waved goodbye. God bless them all. Midlands Dental Group - Timber RidgeFilip B. ratedI broke my back molar in half less than 24 hrs before we were leaving on a week's vacation and knew that I was in trouble the minute it happened. By this time on a Friday, my regular dental office was closed...as apparently a large majority are on Friday afternoons in Omaha. I made multiple calls and Timber Ridge Dental Group on Fort Street was able to squeeze me in and get a temporary crown in place.They were booked but realized the urgency of my situation and thankfully helped me out. I would have had a miserable vacation in San Francisco had it not been for this office. Thank you for the wonderful staff that helped me through this! They were nothing but accommodating, helpful and professional with my initial appointment and second appointment to set the permanent crown.Newell, Brian D, DDSisabel001 ratedHighly recommend this dentist office.  The girls on the front desk are so cheery and personable. They always made me feel very comfortable. Rates are very reasonable.Very patient with all my questions, courteous in explanations. I knew before hand what was going to be done, how much it would cost and what it would entail. There was no guesswork about any of the procedures!i had three teeth extracted by Dr. Newell with no nitrous and did not even feel a thing. Had a horrible experience at another dentist office, so when I came here I was very afraid but they fully earned my trust. They are very  conscience of your comfort level. Dr. Newell is really so skilled, and was very concerned about my comfort.McManigal Family DentistryR A. ratedThis is the best office in Omaha !The staff is so caring, the Office Manager is extremely nice and helped us feel comfortable she explained the procedures and even went over the treatment plan before we left  she  told me when I'm ready to start fixing my teeth to call and make the appointment at no time was she pushy as the other review had said  In fact my husband was shocked when he read the review by another patient thinking they were out of their minds and not use to change! The Doctor is caring and went over everything with us he spent plenty of time answering all questions and did not rush us The staff made our Family feel comfortable. We highly recommend this office!! Farm Bureau Financial Services Ron Randallrideumcowgirl ratedRon Randall &amp;amp; his Farm Bureau staff are goldenRon cares about his clients.  He isn't just an agent.  He becomes an ally who will go to bat for you for getting your premiums reduced, claims reconsidered, and coverage extended.  He has even gone in &amp; reviewed our coverage and rates &amp; submitted paperwork to get us the best discount available without even bringing it to our attention.  He is as thoughtful and forthright an agent as you will ever find.  And his staff are very friendly, helpful, and caring as well.  He attracts positive people.  I would recommend this agency to anyone who is looking for a change.  You won't be disappointed.Midlands Dental Group - Timber RidgePatta H. ratedI recently received a flyer for Timber Ridge Dental on Fort Street. Having had a toothache for several days, I decided to give them a try. I hate going to the dentist, but was very pleasentlysurprised by my experience at Timber Ridge. The office is a very nice, clean office. Staff is top notch, starting with the staff at the front desk, the dental assistant and the Dr. I saw. They took care of my problem and have earned my trust. I have set up another appointment with this office for a check up. No more toothaches for me....this office is great!Horizon Dental Centercris10k ratedWonderful! My first visit was ...Wonderful! My first visit was an emergency.  I was able to get right in.  Dr Penly was great.  He explained everything he was doing and took his time with me.  Unfortunatly, through no fault of Dr. Penly, I was having trouble with the procedure that was done.  I called the emergency line on a Sunday morning.  My page was answered in a timely manner by Dr. Sheldon and he helped me out in an extremely friendly manner even though I called on a Sunday.  This is going to be my new dentist office now!! I have already recommened them to several people!American Family Insurance - Ken Rolf Agency, Inc.Rick W. ratedKen is a very friendly businessman. He made me feel like I had known him for a long time. I felt very comfortable sitting and visiting  with him about my insurance needs. He made the policies I was interested in very plan and was upfront with costs. I am happy that my wife and I are now a part of American Family. The switch was very easy from our previous insurance provider. I would highly recommend getting to know Ken if you are looking for an insurance alternative.Fitzgerald Richard D DDSCarl S. ratedI had been told that my teeth were hopeless before coming to Dr. Fitzgerald for an extraction.  He pulled the tooth painlessly, but took extra time to show me how to take care of my teeth and keep them for a long time.  That was ten years ago.  My mouth was a mess.    He did not rush me.  He understood my very limited finances.  His staff are like friends.  I'm proud of my smile now!I wish I'd found him when I was young, but he really has helped me!Midlands Dental Group - Timber RidgeHayden M. ratedI felt that i was treated very well by all of the staff. Dr. mcConnell was very sweet and explained everything to me very nicely. Shem ade me feel very safe and at ease as well. Fronk desk staff was very professional and sweet. I enjoyed my experience considering what i had done. I would like to thank everybody for making my first experience an easy one and not traumatic one. ive never had to have surgery for my mouthDid You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books
