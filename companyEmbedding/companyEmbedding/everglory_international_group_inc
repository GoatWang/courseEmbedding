▌Quality Control System
Principle of quality of Ever-Glory :       
99 + ( -1 ) = 0 
Ever-Glory’s staff always pursues excellence based on client’s requirement.
“99+(-1)=0” means zero tolerance for imperfections = milestone of the whole group’s QES management.
Ever-Glory pays close attention to every detail concerning quality to meet high standards required by our clients, suppliers and employees
1.  Professional training and guidance from the Inspection and Quarantine Bureau

2. Client/ Apparel Category Evaluation
Before finalizing client orders, Ever-Glory will meet with clients to understand their business requirements and ensure that not only do we have the right product range, but also that the potential client fits the desired profile of companies we seek to do business with.
3. Assessment of Suppliers (fabrics and garment factories)
Before purchasing,  Ever-Glory QA department assesses the quality control abilities of suppliers,  conveys the client’s requirement to suppliers and sends out merchandisers to  follow up and check their production processes. Ever-Glory QA department  performs an annual audit every year to ensure quality, chemical safety and  social compliance meets client’s requirements.
4.  Fabric and trim quality control
a) During fabric and trim  production, Ever-Glory always sends QC to mills and factories to monitor and  instruct their production to ensure quality and delivery.
b) After bulk fabric and  trims are ready, they will be sent to Ever-Glory’s FAB/ACC warehouse for  inspection. Based on 4 point system standard, warehouse does 100% inspection of  all shell fabric and performs random check for lining and trims.

c) merchandising team will  also send bulk fabric and trims to Ever-Glory’s in-house laboratory to test  their interior quality like physical & chemical points based on individual  client request.

d) Once Warehouse and  laboratory test passed, results will be input into ERP system. At which point  fabric/trim can be released to factory for apparel bulk production. If test  fail, fabric and trims will be returned to mills for repair or replacement.

5. Quality control system in garment factory
a) PP meeting: Before bulk  production for each order, Ever-Glory’s merchandiser, factory QC, workshop  leader, technician and supervisor of the sewing team will attend PP meeting to  decide technical procedure, inspection standards, key processing points and  other details. In this meeting, everybody will learn and discuss all details  about this product so that everybody can have the same understanding about the  quality request and workmanship clearly to avoid any potential mistakes.      
 b) 100% Cutting Piece inspection: After  cutting, all pieces must be inspected & numbered. All defective pieces must  be replaced!
c) First garment comes out  from sewing line: This garment will not only be inspected by factory QC, but  also sent to Ever-Glory head office and checked by merchandiser and technician.  Then factory will collect all data together to improve bulk.
d) Inline inspection in sewing lines: There is  always an inspector in each sewing line to inspect the inline product 100%
e) There are also  inspection supervisors in workshops to supervise workmanship and monitor  quality always.
f) First garment that comes  out from finishing department: This garment will also not only be inspected by  factory QC but also sent to Ever-Glory head office and checked by merchandisers  and technicians to ensure finishing and packaging are correct.
g) Inspection in finishing  department: There are always inspectors in each finishing process to ensure  100% inspection for each step such as ironing, buttoning, bar-tacking and so  on.
h) Final inspection in garment  factory: Factory has a final inspection team to do 100% inspection before  packing. This is to ensure every product packed is up to individual  client’s  standards.
6. Quality control from Ever-Glory head office
a) Each order, Ever-Glory will send garment QC  to factory to monitor and instruct their production, give factory support and  training when necessary. Once any mistake happens, QC will report to Ever-Glory  merchandiser in a timely manner. At the same time they will assist factory to  solve those technical problems.
b) When factory finished  bulk, Ever-Glory will also send Final Inspection team to do a random check  based on AQL 1.5-4.0 according to individual client’s request). Once final  inspection passed, factory can arrange shipment accordingly. Otherwise factory  must repair and re-inspect the bulk.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.
