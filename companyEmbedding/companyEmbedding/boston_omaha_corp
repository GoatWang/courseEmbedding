Privacy Policy

BOSTON OMAHA CORPORATIONPRIVACY POLICY1. Acceptance of BOC’s Privacy Policy. With respect to information submitted or collected on the Boston Omaha Corporation (“BOC”) website (the “Site”), you accept BOC’s privacy policy as set forth herein (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy does not pertain to, and BOC is not responsible for the privacy practices of, any third party websites to which the BOC Site hyperlinks. Certain areas of the BOC Site may be subject to additional privacy related provisions, links to which will be posted in those areas.2. Activity Logging. When you use the BOC Site, which may be hosted in part or its entirety by a third party, the BOC Site will collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of “cookies” or your “IP address”) about your activities. BOC uses this activity information (the “Activity Information”) for internal purposes such as to administer the BOC Site, improve the BOC Site, and help BOC understand how the BOC Site is being used including the demographics and “clickstreams” of its visitors. “Cookies” are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the BOC Site. You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits, but in that case, some portions of the BOC Site may not operate properly. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.3. Personally Identifiable Information. The BOC Site is designed so that you may generally browse it without providing any Personally Identifiable Information (defined below). Certain areas of the BOC Site, however, may require or allow the voluntarily submission of Personally Identifiable Information (for example, registration to receive BOC shareholder materials). BOC uses your Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes for which it was submitted by you to BOC and for BOC to send you publications and invitations that may be of interest to you. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3, BOC does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties. “Personally Identifiable Information” means information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, such as your name, physical or electronic mail address, and telephone number; provided, however, that Personally Identifiable Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons and does not include the Activity Information.4. Removal of Personally Identifiable Information. BOC will use reasonable efforts to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our then current BOC Site at any time upon your written request to contact@bostonomaha.com. Such removal of Personally Identifiable Information will not ensure the permanent removal of such Personally Identifiable Information from the BOC Site. For example, such Personally Identifiable Information may remain in BOC’s archival or backup copies of the BOC Site.5. Additional Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information. BOC may share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, including affiliated firms and third parties performing services for or on behalf of BOC. Such services may include communications, database, event management, hosting, mailing, and marketing services. Additionally, BOC cannot fully ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, BOC may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may circumvent BOC’s security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or an error may occur in the administration of the BOC Site. In the unlikely event that BOC needs to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, BOC may, and you authorize BOC to, disclose any information about you to government officials as permitted by applicable law.6. Miscellaneous Privacy Terms. BOC has implemented and follows appropriate technical measures to protect against the risks of unauthorized access to, erroneous disclosure of, and unlawful interception of Personally Identifiable Information. You should know, however, that BOC cannot fully eliminate such risks. BOC hopes this Privacy Policy clarifies BOC’s procedures regarding its collection, use and disclosure of your information including Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time, BOC may modify this Privacy Policy. Such modifications will be effective on the date that BOC posts the modified statement to the BOC Site. Questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy may be submitted to contact@bostonomaha.com.

Privacy Policy

BOSTON OMAHA CORPORATIONPRIVACY POLICY1. Acceptance of BOC’s Privacy Policy. With respect to information submitted or collected on the Boston Omaha Corporation (“BOC”) website (the “Site”), you accept BOC’s privacy policy as set forth herein (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy does not pertain to, and BOC is not responsible for the privacy practices of, any third party websites to which the BOC Site hyperlinks. Certain areas of the BOC Site may be subject to additional privacy related provisions, links to which will be posted in those areas.2. Activity Logging. When you use the BOC Site, which may be hosted in part or its entirety by a third party, the BOC Site will collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of “cookies” or your “IP address”) about your activities. BOC uses this activity information (the “Activity Information”) for internal purposes such as to administer the BOC Site, improve the BOC Site, and help BOC understand how the BOC Site is being used including the demographics and “clickstreams” of its visitors. “Cookies” are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the BOC Site. You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits, but in that case, some portions of the BOC Site may not operate properly. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.3. Personally Identifiable Information. The BOC Site is designed so that you may generally browse it without providing any Personally Identifiable Information (defined below). Certain areas of the BOC Site, however, may require or allow the voluntarily submission of Personally Identifiable Information (for example, registration to receive BOC shareholder materials). BOC uses your Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes for which it was submitted by you to BOC and for BOC to send you publications and invitations that may be of interest to you. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3, BOC does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties. “Personally Identifiable Information” means information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, such as your name, physical or electronic mail address, and telephone number; provided, however, that Personally Identifiable Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons and does not include the Activity Information.4. Removal of Personally Identifiable Information. BOC will use reasonable efforts to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our then current BOC Site at any time upon your written request to contact@bostonomaha.com. Such removal of Personally Identifiable Information will not ensure the permanent removal of such Personally Identifiable Information from the BOC Site. For example, such Personally Identifiable Information may remain in BOC’s archival or backup copies of the BOC Site.5. Additional Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information. BOC may share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, including affiliated firms and third parties performing services for or on behalf of BOC. Such services may include communications, database, event management, hosting, mailing, and marketing services. Additionally, BOC cannot fully ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, BOC may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may circumvent BOC’s security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or an error may occur in the administration of the BOC Site. In the unlikely event that BOC needs to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, BOC may, and you authorize BOC to, disclose any information about you to government officials as permitted by applicable law.6. Miscellaneous Privacy Terms. BOC has implemented and follows appropriate technical measures to protect against the risks of unauthorized access to, erroneous disclosure of, and unlawful interception of Personally Identifiable Information. You should know, however, that BOC cannot fully eliminate such risks. BOC hopes this Privacy Policy clarifies BOC’s procedures regarding its collection, use and disclosure of your information including Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time, BOC may modify this Privacy Policy. Such modifications will be effective on the date that BOC posts the modified statement to the BOC Site. Questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy may be submitted to contact@bostonomaha.com.
