QUARTERLY LETTER

2nd Quarter 2017 — Investment Strategy Review

“The first rule of fishing is fish where the fish are.  ” 

                                        
                                          — Charles T. Munger




The U.S. stock market continued to advance during the second quarter as the major indices posted a series of record highs. Investors have somehow ignored the wacky political atmosphere and focused on the bullish combination of resilient corporate earnings and low interest rates. The S&P 500 index closed out the first half with a gain of 8.2%. Daily trading action has been eerily calm given the overall background.  We are not forecasting a correction, but the post-election Trump bump was fueled by the promise of major tax reform, which appears impossible anytime soon. Furthermore, the Fed has begun to raise rates and price/earnings multiples are expensive, making it difficult to intellectualize a significant rally ahead. 
As you know, Mercer Capital emphasizes value. When the shares of superior businesses are cheap, we do not stress about the macro picture. Our primary concern is that the massive liquidity created by the world's central banks has encouraged risky investment practices and bloated valuations across most asset classes. For example, Argentina, a nation that has defaulted seven times in the past 200 years, just issued a bond maturing in 100 years. The $2.75 billion offering was gobbled up by supposedly rational institutional investors. Does anyone ever think about return of capital? We are also troubled by speculative behavior that is a byproduct of the serene stock market rally. A recent phenomenon is the popularity of trading strategies revolving around the CBOE volatility index - otherwise known as the VIX. Let's not get bogged down in the complex details, but suffice it to say that certain aspects of the practice are reminiscent of the portfolio insurance hedging blamed for the depth of the 1987 crash. Please be advised - our intent here is to inform, not alarm.
Charlie Munger's comment above sums up the present investment situation, particularly in the U.S., where there isn't much worth fishing for. We'll keep trolling for value, but new ideas are scarce. Our ideal asset is an equity stake in a dominant, well-managed business that can be held for a long time. Investors could be witnessing an evolutionary turning point for business in general. Technology is disrupting business models and many successful enterprises are facing what may become a less profitable future. Everyone is talking about the extraordinary growth of Amazon and the toll this is taking on traditional retailing, but technological change is impacting a wide variety of industries. It is tough, in fact, to think of a business that can easily raise prices. Some even believe that the power of brands will be less influential in the future. All of this is going to impact how we evaluate not just potential investments, but also current holdings.
Amazon's cash offer to acquire Whole Foods Market has investors wondering what Jeff Bezos is up to this time. The company has travelled a vast distance from a simple online vendor of books. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Buffett and Munger marveled at Amazon's metamorphosis and Bezos's genius, admitting that it was an unforced error not to invest in the shares. As noted recently by the Wall Street Journal, a $10,000 purchase of AMZN at the time of the initial public offering in 1997 would be worth $4.9 million today. This is a gain of 36% compounded annually, which is 155 times the return of the S&P 500 index. However, it was not an easy ride. The stock has tumbled at least 20% during 16 of the past 20 years and more than 40% in almost half of these selloffs. Investors still have nightmares about Amazon's 95% collapse when the late 1990s dot.com bubble deflated. It would have taken incredible fortitude to hang on. There are several valuable lessons to be learned. First - a winning equity investment requires both complete confidence in the strength of the underlying business and patience bordering on stubbornness. Second - do not worry that you missed it. The stock market's manic-depressive personality provides plenty of opportunities to buy low.
Thanks for your encouragement and support. We hope that you have an enjoyable summer.

Mercer Capital Advisers, Inc. — Investment Philosophy






Contact Us | Directions













INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

Mercer Capital's philosophy has been strongly influenced by legendary investors
   such as Warren  Buffett, Ben Graham, and John Templeton. Our job is the rational allocation of investment capital. Investments are chosen on the basis of value, not popularity.






 Our first objective is the preservation of capital. Investments must have an attractive “margin of
   safety.”

 Independent thinking is critical. Conventional wisdom is often wrong on Wall Street. The best 
   long-term investment opportunities tend to be discovered in out-of-favor situations.

 Investor psychology exerts a powerful force on the financial markets. Markets are susceptible to
   manic changes of mood. We try to profit from these swings between fear and greed.

 Investments are focused on our best ideas. We are patient and disciplined. Like baseball great Ted
   Williams, we wait for a fat pitch.

 We stay within our circle of competence and invest only in companies that operate businesses we
   understand.

 The ideal equity investment is a business franchise, a company with a durable competitive 
   advantage.

 Management should respect shareholders and deploy capital wisely. We prefer modest, team
   oriented CEO's, not empire builders.

 We are disciplined about value. Our goal is to buy superior businesses at reasonable prices. Investing
   at a discount to fair value enhances the margin of safety.


 Attractive businesses earn high returns on invested capital. We follow the axiom
   of Charles Munger, who observed that: “The real money is made in great businesses
   which can earn very high returns on
   capital over a long, long period of time.”


 We try to be as tax efficient as possible. Portfolio turnover is low.

What are analysts saying about Colgate-Palmolive Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Colgate-Palmolive Company stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Colgate has outperformed the broader sector over the past six months. The company has been witnessing enhanced margins for a while now, driven by cost-savings from the funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program. Also, better pricing and emerging market growth have boosted performance amid a tough macro environment. This was evident from the earnings beat reported in first-quarter 2017. Further, Colgate-Palmolive’s growth strategy has been largely guided by innovation and in-store implementation, enabling it to capture market share across all reagions and categories. However, the company's sales trend remains soft due to currency woes. Management expects adverse currency and a tough global environment to impact 2017 results, as reflected by its outlook. Nonetheless, organic sales are expected to improve sequentially throughout the year. Also, Colgate’s shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy." (7/4/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Late Tues. (5/16), the NY Post reported that CL Chair/CEO Ian Cook recently told investors he would consider selling the company for $100/share (~19.5x EV/EBITDA). While we have no knowledge of any potential M&A or the specific accuracy of this report, this strikes us as a reasonable price (for both a potential buyer and for CL as sellers). We view JNJ as the most likely acquirer, followed by ULVR and KHC/3G. Valuation remains nearly full, reit. $76 PT, Hold. CL CEO/Chairman Ian Cook reportedly would consider selling for $100/share: Late Tuesday, the NY Post reported the Ian Cook, Colgate’s Chairman and CEO, recently signaled he would be open to selling the company… for $100/share", while at a meeting with institutional investors. The Post further noted recent speculation the CL is being stalked by" Unilever and pointed to activist Nelson Peltz’s stake in P&G as a potential spark for sector consolidation." (5/17/2017)
3. B. Riley analysts commented, "Colgate (CL) reported 4Q16 EPS of $0.75 vs. $0.73, in line with consensus and $0.01 below our estimate.  Op. profit of $1,038MM (+2% YoY) fell short of consensus of $1,071MM.  Organic sales were +1.5% (+4.6% exp.), with organic volume -1%'this was only the second quarter since 2002 with an organic volume decline for CL.  Volume was impacted by the India demonetization and a distributor issue in Africa/ Eurasia; organic volume was up in only one of the six segments.  CL expects organic sales +4% in 2017, and cut EPS guidance from up double-digits to up low-single digits, due to FX and lower category growth rates.  We are lowering our 2017E/2018E EPS by $0.20 each to $2.90/$3.20 and our PT from $78.00 to $74.00, based on 23x 2018E EPS of $3.20.  While 3% EPS growth in 2017 looks achievable (even conservative), we are concerned by how much marketing investment, and competitive 'catching up,' is implied.  If interest rates go higher in 2017, staples stocks may have a tough time outperforming, but we view Procter & Gamble (PG; Buy; $106.00 PT) as more attractive than CL, because PG's organic sales growth is driving higher toward 3%, while CL's has been decelerating.  As the gap continues to narrow between CL's and PG's organic sales growth rates, we think investors will become increasingly attracted to PG.  The two stocks' valuations are similar on EV-to-EBITDA."

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
