Triangle Petroleum: Facing A Critical Deadline - Triangle Petroleum Corporation (NYSEMKT:TPLM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Triangle Petroleum: Facing A Critical DeadlineMay.30.16 | About: Triangle Petroleum (TPLM) Richard Zeits Oil & gas, commodities, long/short equity, research analystMarketplaceZeits OIL ANALYTICSSummaryWith no restructuring support agreement with creditors secured so far, Triangle is running out of time.The concern is reinforced by Triangle’s disclosure of a failed negotiation with its largest investor.A free fall filing cannot be ruled out.

 Important note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article. I wrote in my April 18 note with regard to the outlook for a Triangle Petroleum (NYSEMKT:TPLM) balance sheet restructuring: Can a reorganization at TUSA be avoided at this point? While a hope always exists, there is not a single tangible sign or argument that I personally can find in support of such a scenario. As one can see from the Chapter 11 filing by Energy XXI (NASDAQ:OTC:EXXI) this week, a reorganization in the current commodity price environment can be devastating for junior stake holder classes as it effectively locks in asset valuations based on the current extremely low commodity prices, curtailing any upside from a potential cyclical recovery. While Triangle Petroleum Corporation has not released any statement regarding the results of its restructuring effort, there are multiple signs that the outcome may indeed be unfavorable to the existing TPLM shareholders. Triangle faces an important deadline on May 31, 2016. In the absence of a restructuring support agreement by that date, a risk of a free fall filing is high. The May 31, 2016 Deadline As a reminder, Triangle Petroleum Corporation has a holding company structure, with the majority of the company's borrowings being at the operating subsidiary level. Triangle Petroleum USA, or "TUSA," the E&P subsidiary, has two debt components:
  $350 million first lien credit agreement; ~$416 million in principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes.  The holding company has $141 million of 5% convertible notes (as of October 31, 2015; including $21 million of accrued interest). 

 (Source: Triangle Petroleum Corporation, December 2015) On April 28, 2016, TUSA received notice from the administrative agent under its credit agreement that the borrowing base under the agreement had been redetermined and reduced to $225 million from $350 million, effective as of April 28, 2016. As of April 28, TUSA had $347.5 million of outstanding borrowings and $2.5 million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility, or $125 million in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. Under the agreement, TUSA had 10 days after the notification to elect to cure the borrowing base deficiency. Triangle stated in its disclosure that "TUSA expects to elect to repay the borrowing base deficiency in three equal monthly installments, the first payment of which is due by May 31, 2016." As of April 28, TUSA had cash on hand of approximately $152 million. While theoretically TUSA may elect to pay the first installment on May 31, a more likely scenario is a comprehensive restructuring agreement. In the absence of such agreement, Triangle may have to consider a "free fall" filing for protection under Chapter 11 to preserve precious liquidity in the system. Restructuring Discussions with NGP End Without Result On May 23, Triangle disclosed that it had engaged into discussions with its major shareholder, NGP Triangle Holdings, LLC ("NGP"), in connection with a potential consensual restructuring or recapitalization of Triangle. Specifically, Triangle stated in its 8-K filing:
 …by this filing we disclose that (i) the Company engaged in discussions with NGP with respect to the terms of the Potential Restructuring and (ii) such discussions terminated without the parties reaching agreement. Discussions between NGP and the Company may resume at any time, and the Company undertakes no obligation to disclose the existence or nature of such discussions until an agreement has been reached between the parties. While it is difficult to discern the "bid and ask" in these negotiations, the disclosure does not sound particularly encouraging from the holding company investor perspective. The Outlook Is Worrisome The borrowing base redetermination, which reduced the borrowing base to just $225 million, indicates that the first lien lenders assigned a relatively low value to the company's proved reserves. Even though oil prices have been moving higher, one can easily envision a scenario where, in the event of a reorganization under Chapter 11, both the TUSA first lien credit agreement and TUSA senior unsecured notes would be deemed impaired claim classes, which likely puts the TUSA unsecured noteholders into a position of significant control. While there is always a hope that a "prepack" restructuring agreement would be achieved whereby the holding company, Triangle Petroleum Corporation, receives some distribution under the restructuring plan, there are several signs that such a scenario is not particularly probable. First, Triangle appears to be giving up the fight for a recovery of its investment in RockPile, the completion services operating subsidiary. In a recent press release, RockPile announced that "after conducting an extensive evaluation, Triangle and RockPile have mutually agreed to pursue strategic alternatives that would allow both companies to separately and independently execute on their business strategies and operational plans." My interpretation is that Triangle may have elected to "turn the keys over" to RockPile lenders. Second, NGP disclosed sales of ~234,000 TPLM shares that took place on May 24 and May 25, at prices of approximately $0.22 and $0.23 per share. While the sold shares represent a small percentage of the total holdings by NGP, the disclosure reinforces the concern with regard to the outcome for TPLM shareholders.
