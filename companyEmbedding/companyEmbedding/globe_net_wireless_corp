					Full Description



Globe Net Wireless Corp., incorporated on September 4, 2009, is a shell company. The Company is a development-stage company engaged in the development of a telecommunication business to provide Internet and related services to both consumers and businesses in under serviced or unserviced areas at real broadband speeds through its wireless technology. The Company has developed a mobile text marketing platform, TextPro Connect IQ, which will be used in the open source application programming interface (API) ecosystems. The Company is engaged in the development and testing of a second API application known as Swappit for its application incubator business.The Company's TextPro Connect IQ is a single, unified, Web-based system allowing customers to create campaigns that utilize a range of marketing tools, including mobile coupons, short message service (SMS) marketing, Quick Response (QR) codes, mobile keywords, Mobile splash pages, surveys, voting, polls, e-mail marketing and social media status updates. Additionally, business and event planners have the ability to offer text reminders. The Company utilizes a software as a service (SAAS) model for TextPro Connect IQ.The Company's Swappit is a person to person online swapping platform. Users download the application and then set their criteria, which will allow Swappit to find a potential swapping match. The criteria will be based on how long the user is willing to trade for in days or weeks, the distance the user is willing to travel to trade in kilometers or miles, item category and price level, then a picture of the items. Once all the parameters have been entered by the user, then the Swappit application will then search through its database of users to find a potential swapping match and allow the user to decide if they want to proceed with a swap or wait and search for more items. Once a match is found what the user desires they arrange to meet the other user and complete the swap.The Company is developing a system to deliver high-speed Internet service wirelessly to rural subscribers. As of August 31, 2016, the Company focused on developing a technology that will broadcast an omni-directional wireless signal with a radius of up to approximately 20 miles using 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum. Its Internet and wireless connectivity systems will transmit high-speed Internet service wirelessly over the 600 MHz to 800 MHz spectrum, 700 MHz being the optimal band, at speeds as high as 20 megabits per second (Mbps) download and four Mbps upload. The signal will be transmitted from an omni-directional antenna mounted on an elevated structure, such as a transmission or communications tower. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had not generated any revenues.

Analysis of Financing Scenarios

After deduction of $23,000 for estimated offering expenses including legal and
registration fees, accounting and auditing, electronic filing and printing, and
transfer agent, the net proceeds from this offering may be as much as $227,000,
assuming all 5,000,000 shares are sold. However, there can be no assurance that
any of these shares will be sold. Globe Net will use the proceeds to (1) pay for
the annual costs of being a public reporting company, (2) develop Internet and
wireless connectivity systems and develop its website, (3) identify and
establish supply contracts with equipment suppliers and service providers, (4)
identify and obtain required licenses and permits, (5) market rural internet
service packages to potential users, (6) train staff and technicians, (7) set up
transmitting locations, and (8) sign up a minimum of 100 subscribers to its
residential and commercial service packages.

Even if the offering is fully subscribed for, Globe Net may not have sufficient
funds to cover its anticipated costs during the next 12 months and Globe Net may
have to raise additional funds either from equity offerings, debt offerings, or
revenue generation.

If only a portion of the offering is completed, the funds will be allocated as
set out above in the Use of Proceeds table.
 
The projected expenditures shown above are only estimates or approximations and
do not represent a firm commitment by Globe Net. To the extent that the proposed
expenditures are insufficient for the purposes indicated, supplemental amounts
required may be drawn from other categories of estimated expenditures, if
available. Conversely, any amounts not expended as proposed will be used for
general working capital. Globe Net will amend the registration statement by
post-effective amendment if there are any material changes to the use of
proceeds as described above.

Working capital is the cost related to operating Globe Net’s office. It is
comprised of telephone service, mail, stationery, administrative salaries,
accounting, acquisition of office equipment and supplies estimated at a minimum
of $20,000 for one year. Also, costs of being a public reporting company include
the additional cost of preparing and filing reports with the SEC, which Globe
Net has estimated at a minimum of $32,000 for the next 12 months.

Globe Net will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock
being offered by the selling stockholders. If Globe Net fails to sell sufficient
shares of common stock to cover the expenses of this offering, Globe Net will
use existing working capital to pay all offering expenses.


Almost all rural internet service providers who currently offer wireless
Internet to rural areas use either standard Wi-Fi (802.11b) or satellite
technology.

Wi-Fi / 802.11b

802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000. 802.11b has a maximum raw
data rate of 11 Mbps, with average throughput of about 4.5Mbps. 802.11b devices
suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4GHz band. When
implemented as a rural Internet solution, the path between the transmission
tower and the receiving equipment must be in direct line-of-sight or
better. Obstructions, such as trees or snow, can cause connection
problems. Wi-Fi services typically offer speeds of up to 2.5Mbps download and
1.0Mbps upload. Prices can be relatively low, but speed, reliability, and
availability are all common issues.

Satellite

Satellite Internet service is available in even the remotest locations. However,
satellite also requires a completely clear line-of-sight between the dish and
the satellite for the system to work. In addition to the signal being
susceptible to absorption and scattering by moisture, it is similarly impacted
by the presence of trees and other vegetation in the path of the signal. Most
consumer satellite systems operate above 2 GHz making them sensitive to even
minor obstructions such as cloudy skies, heavy rain, or leaves on the receiving
dish. Typical satellite services offer speeds of up to 1.0Mbps download and
256kbps upload. Pricing can be quite high, and problems such as low speeds,
inconsistent connections, and high latency are common

For most major providers, bringing internet service to these remote locations is
simply an unprofitable proposition either because there are not enough potential
customers or because it is too costly to justify expansion of their network in
the area. Some competitors of Globe Net include Omnicity Corp., a public company
located in Rushville, Indiana, and Machlink Corporation, a private company
located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The GNW System offers faster Internet speeds than what some competing companies
are currently offering to their rural subscribers. While higher download speeds
are immediately obvious to most internet users (i.e. loading pages faster,
downloading content faster), faster upload speeds achievable through the use of
the GNW System will appeal to commercial and business users as information can
be sent from the location faster. This is a definite advantage for organizations
running servers that often transmit information (i.e. medical, governmental) or,
transmit large amounts of information (i.e. file server, content provider).

Some people still regard higher Internet speed as a luxury, only good for
loading web pages faster or downloading the latest music videos quicker.
However, having faster Internet provides many more advantages not only for
consumers but for businesses as well.

Increased Productivity – Users can retrieve large documents, research
information, and send and receive email quicker. Rural business employees do not
need to go on trips to other locations for meetings. Instead, they can join web
conferences, allowing businesses save time that would otherwise be spent on
several days of travel as well as on money for flights, hotels, meals, and
rental cars.

Increased Flexibility – Broadband Internet makes working at home possible. Users
can remotely connect to their office computers and perform tasks as if they were
in that office. This makes it possible for employees in remote areas to work as
part of a larger office environment without the expense of traveling to and from
work.

Internet Telephony – Rural users really take advantage of Voice-Over-IP (VoIP)
for their telephone service. In areas were cellular phone coverage is
non-existent or unreliable and land-line service is only partially available,
VoIP is a good solution. Plus, with typically lower monthly and long distance
fees, VoIP users can realize substantial cost savings. VoIP will not work well
with satellite Internet because of the high latency inherent in that technology.

Expanded Communications – Many people use programs like Skype and Google Chat to
video conference or voice chat with family members and friends. Businesses use
web conferencing to have meetings or real-time collaboration software to work on
team-centric projects. Educational establishments are using it to reach out to
students who cannot attend classes physically or post videos of lectures for
students to download and review at a later time. All of these applications
require high-speed access.
 
Multimedia Entertainment – Faster Internet delivers better multimedia
entertainment. Without real broadband connectivity, viewing videos or
downloading music is not a satisfying experience. In fact, some services will
not even work without a fast enough Internet connection.

Also, with the GNW System, Globe Net can bring the Internet to areas where Wi-Fi
service cannot reach simply because the GNW System is not as susceptible to the
pitfalls that affect the other technologies and will not be prone to these
interference problems.

Line-of-Sight - Wi-Fi relies on having direct line-of-sight between the
transmission tower and the receiving antenna, leaving many locations
unserviceable. For example, with trees or other vegetation in the signal path
between the source and receiver, Wi-Fi service would not work. Satellite
Internet requires a clear line-of-sight between the receiving dish and the
orbiting satellite, so inclement weather such as snow or heavy rain or even
cloudy skies, can adversely affect the service. The GNW System’s lower operating
frequency will allows its signal to pass through buildings, trees and other
obstacles, thereby reaching locations Wi-Fi simply cannot “see”.

Interference - Wi-Fi operates at 2.4GHz. Other devices operating at this
frequency, like microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, and cordless
telephones will interfere with a Wi-Fi signal. Satellite systems are prone to
rain fade (degradation during heavy precipitation) and occasional brief periods
of solar interference in mid-March and late September, when the sun lines up
with the satellite for a few minutes each day. Rain fade and solar interference
affect all satellite links from time to time, not just Internet systems.


Company Description
Globe Net is a Nevada company and was incorporated on September 4, 2009. Globe
Net is a startup company engaged in the development of proprietary wireless
broadband technology for the purpose of becoming a rural internet service
provider (RISP). Globe Net is a “shell” company as defined by the SEC


 as a
result of only having nominal operations and nominal assets. Globe Net is an
“emerging growth company” under the federal securities laws and will be subject
to reduced public company reporting requirements.
 
Globe Net’s mission is to provide rural communities with high-speed internet
connectivity at speeds equal or better than existing competing services. Through
the use of its Internet and wireless connectivity systems, Globe Net will try to
provide internet and related services to both consumers and businesses in
currently under serviced or unserviceable areas at real broadband speeds. Globe
Net plans to offer for sale its GNW Systems to residents and businesses located
in under-serviced or non-serviced rural areas worldwide with the initial focus
on North America and China. As of the effective date of this prospectus Globe 
Net has not conducted any business operations nor generated any revenues.

Since September 2009, Globe Net has had its executive head office at 2302-3
Pacific Plaza, 410 Des Voeux Road West, Hong Kong. The telephone number at this
office is (852) 37-55-8010. Our website: www.globenetwireless.com.
