										Michael Slade is a trial lawyer with a broad commercial and appellate litigation practice. His cases involve all types of complex commercial litigation, including products liability, professional liability, consumer fraud, labor and employment law, trade secrets, and construction related matters. Michael also has extensive experience and a proven track record of success in high-stakes bankruptcy litigation. Michael's recent clients have included Boeing, Citadel, Navistar, Motorola, United Airlines, and Winston & Strawn LLP. 
Representative Matters
Represented Boeing in a series of matters arising out of the Sea Launch venture. In 2016, after six years of litigation in four countries, Boeing won summary judgment as plaintiff against three companies controlled by the Russian and Ukrainian governments. The total judgment in Boeing’s favor, entered May 12, 2016, exceeded $500 million. In addition, following summary judgment, Boeing won a bench trial against U.S. affiliates of the Russian entity on its claim that the U.S. entities were alter egos of the Russian affiliates, equally liable for the judgment entered in Boeing’s favor. See The Boeing Company v. KB Yuzhnoye et al., 2016 WL 2851297 (C.D. Cal. May 13, 2016). These victories were recognized by The American Lawyer as the Transatlantic Litigation matters of the year for 2016.
Represented Winston & Strawn LLP in $1.6 billion legal malpractice case arising out of Winston's representation of hedge fund. Secured a dismissal with prejudice. Peterson v. Winston & Strawn, 2012 WL 4892758 (N.D. Ill. 2012), aff'd 729 F.3d 750 (7th Cir. 2013).

Teza Technologies, 2010 WL 3560520 (Ill. Cir. Ct. 2010).
Represented Navistar in a breach of contract case filed by Ford Motor Company, where Ford sought over $1 billion in damages.  After two years of litigation, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement. In a joint press release, the parties stated that as part of the settlement, Ford made a cash payment to Navistar, and Navistar also acquired additional equity in certain joint ventures between the companies.

Liab. Litig, 328 F. Supp. 2d 791 (N.D. Ohio 2004).
Represented numerous firm clients on a wide range of employment law issues. Michael has drafted scores of restrictive covenants and litigated many matters involving non-competition and non-solicitation agreements, most of which also involved theft of trade secrets allegations.  See, e.g., Safety-Kleen Systems v. McGinn, 233 F. Supp. 2d 121 (D. Mass. 2002).  He has also represented companies in discrimination, retaliation, and whistleblower cases.  See, e.g., In re UAL Corp., 2008 WL 450457 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.

New Illinois Supreme Court Decision Requires Detailed Analysis of Restrictive Covenants
			Many employment lawyers believe that Illinois courts are generally hostile to employer-employee non-compete agreements. Outcomes in Illinois restrictive covenant cases have long been unpredictable, highly dependent on the equities, and heavily influenced by the quality of advocacy.
