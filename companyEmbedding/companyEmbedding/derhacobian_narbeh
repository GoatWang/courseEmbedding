Narbeh Derhacobian
Thank you, Leanne. Welcome to everyone joining us today. As highlighted in our press release today, I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter.
With the revenue at high end upper guidance, operating expenses below guidance where it was below guidance enabling us to be well on track to achieve our target at EBITDA breakeven and by middle of the year.
Entering the second quarter, we're excited to see a strong backlog and bookings in our business driven by design wins that are ramping into production across our customer base.
Additionally, we had another strong quarter of new design wins, in which we secured over 90 design wins totaling an annual revenue runway potential of $5 million. Of course, assuming design wins reaching full production and it's always subject to market conditions. This continued momentum of new opportunities should help to secure our expected growth in the second half of 2017 and into 2018.
From an end market perspective, approximately 40% of the design wins were secured in the industrial market, while consumer markets represented approximately 20% of the wins.
Notable design wins included a high volume smart lighting application as well as wins for communication modules in personal computing devices and a high-volume smartphone application.

I had also indicated previously that we started an initiative to focus on large tier 1 ODMs to secure high-volume revenue opportunities for our products. And I'm happy to indicate that in Q1 2017, we secured design wins with several such customers in computing and communication end markets.
These customers are utilizing multiple Adesto products across different applications demonstrating the increasing content and the breath of opportunities we have across our client base.
As a direct result of our focus on diversifying and expanding our customer base over two-thirds of the design wins in the first quarter with new customers.
Another key initiative for us has been to further diversify our business beyond our stronghold in the industrial market into markets where the duration from design win to production shorter and represents higher volume opportunities.
In the first quarter, we had success along these lines as well. Of the top 10 design wins secured in the first quarter ranked by annual dollar value, approximately half are in consumer market and the other half in computing.
One of our biggest assets is our large and top tier customer base. We supply our customers in a variety of ways including direct, through distribution, fulfillment houses and through contract manufacturers.
Hence, as I indicated previously, it's not a trivial task to trace accurately design win conversion wins into production. The last several quarters, we have put forth efforts to identify cases where we can clearly track design wins through the channel and into mass production with the end customers. And I'd like to share this data with you.
Looking at the design wins in 2016 that could be traced clearly in the channel and into production, we can say that approximately two-thirds of them have started to ramp into production. Some are early in their production and some have ramped as expected.
As we progress through the year, additional design wins was also beginning ramping into production, layering onto this growing pipeline of revenue generating designs. This is encouraging as it validates our investment and focus on expanding our base to support our growth profile as evidenced by our expectations for the second quarter.
In terms of our top 20 revenue customers in the first quarter, the revenue breakdown by end market consisted of 42% from industrial market, 39% from consumer market and the remaining 19% is spread across communication, medical, automotive and computing. Examples of applications that are currently in volume production at these customers includes, smart meters as our largest customer, universal remotes, personal tracking devices, streaming TV and media player and many others.
With that, let me take a few minutes to talk about some of our product families in more detail. In the first quarter, we taped out our 65nm version of our 32Mb DataFlash family. This is a follow up tape out at 65-nanometer, as we taped out at 64Mb DataFlash last year as we communicated to you. This is a cost reduction initiative for our DataFlash family.
We will be sampling these products with our leading industrial customers for the rest of the year and into 2018. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make progress sampling our AT35 DataFlash products that are designed specifically for the Asia smart meter market. As I've mentioned previously, this is product family that offers limited feature set, alternative targeting China smart meter customers and is more suitable for the cost-conscious metering and industrial markets, such as the ones in China.
We continue to monitor market demand for DataFlash to see the need for densities beyond 32 and 64Mb at advance notes and will roll out those efforts into our planning when appropriate. We have close working relationships with our metering and industrial customers and always align our development efforts with our partners' product roadmaps. Turning to our Fusion family, we continue to generate increasing revenue and interest for this product. As I mentioned last quarter, this product family had experienced a rapid ramping shipments becoming one of our fasted growing lines.

As many of you know, our existing portfolio are Fusion Flash products range from 256Kb to 4Mb. In order to expand these offerings, we have focused our development efforts on additional densities starting with 8Mb, 16Mb and 32Mb. which we expect to tape out in the fourth quarter. We expect to sample these additional densities in mid-2018. Looking at our EcoXip product family, we also continue to make solid progress on our development and sampling activities. Engineering samples of our 32Mb device have been provided to our early customers and partners.
The broader rollup of this product will occur in the fourth quarter and in 2018. We have started design activity of 128Mb EcoXip and expect to tape out this product this quarter. The 64Mb version of the EcoXip will be taped out later this year.
By mid-2018, we believe we should have 32Mb, 64Mb and 128Mb versions of the EcoXip in various levels of silicon sampling and hopefully in production with some of our early partners. Our EcoXip products can be deployed in many types of IoT and embedded devices, including wearables, medical monitors, POS controllers, sensors and beacons.
Leading MCU and system-on-chip customers such as NXP/Qualcomm are among the early designing customers. Industry leaders believe that as Soc and MCUs move to 28nm and below, embedding non-volatile memory functionality becomes extremely expensive.
EcoXip offers an ideal solution for such cases where performance, cost and power characteristics of an EcoXip device, as a System-in-Package becomes an attractive alternative to today's solutions.
Last quarter, we also taped-out a version of our Mavriq family designed for the camera module per plan. This is 128Kb serial non-volatile memory device, that's ideally suited for this growing market.
We believe this is a very large market opportunity for Adesto and we'll be actively engaged with customers and contract manufacturers to assess their specific needs, while also furthering seeding the market.
This opportunity becomes even more attractive as the density requirements increase in the coming years because the Mavriq platform-base devices are more cost effective than alternative EEProm which are used today. We continue to work toward securing design wins for this application and expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters. Lastly, in terms of Standard Serial Flash product family, we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various high-volume opportunities for notebooks and tablets as well as consumer end markets.
During the first quarter, we secured notable design wins for high-volume smart lighting applications with a leading SoC company. This particular design win is ramping into production this year. We have also secured design wins in a wearables application with a global navigation and variable technology company.
As many of you recall, we began increasing our investment activity around this product group in the third quarter of 2016, as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher unit volumes and faster ramping opportunities, to further diversify our customer base and revenue.
Since that time, we have made notable progress with customers as well as expansion of our product offerings across densities. These products have helped drive additional revenue opportunities near term, as the result of the shorter design cycles, by also broadening our footprint with customers.
As I mentioned last quarter, we anticipate revenue contribution from these products to approach approximately 15% exiting the year which will represents a significant underlying growth rate for this time.
In summary, we look to the second quarter, the combination of design wins ramping into production and continued traction with new products is driving our expectation for strong growth, with revenue projected to grow 25% year-over-year.

Entering Q2, we have record bookings and backlogs and we're seeing this trend continue as we progress through the quarter. This sets the stage for continued momentum across our end markets and product families in the second half of this year.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Ron to review the first quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our second quarter outlook. Ron?
Ron Shelton
Thanks, Narbeh and thanks, everyone, for joining today. Revenue in the first quarter, ended March 31, 2017, was 11.3 million and that was at the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of approximately 11.1% from the 10.2 million in the first quarter of last year and it was down seasonally 8.3% from $12.3 million last quarter.
Gross margin in the first quarter was 49.1% as compared to 49.1% in the first quarter of 2016 and 50.6% last quarter. Gross margins continue to remain at the high end of our long term model and reflect the fact that the market continues to embrace the value added differentiated solutions we provide. The slight decline sequentially in gross margin was due to primary to product mix and the impacted of fixed costs on a lower revenue base.
We continue to expect gross margins to remain near 50%, but, on a quarter to quarter basis, they may fluctuate approximately 100 to 200 basis points. Longer term gross margins will continue to be supported by new products with higher value added content, continued cost reduction initiatives and migration to lower process notes. In addition, we continue to experience a favorable pricing and competitive environment and anticipated pricing pressure in 2017 will remain subdued.
GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $8.1 million as compared to $6.3 million in the prior year quarter and that quarter included a gain of $2 million from a settlement with the former foundry supplier.
GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $7.8 million. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.0 million as compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $6.7 million in the prior quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP OPEX to remain relatively flat when compared to 2016.
Now, looking at first quarter non-GAAP OPEX in more detail, R&D expenses were $3 million as compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $3 million in the prior quarter.
We continue to focus our resources on several market opportunities that we believe can have a more near term revenue contribution and that's resulted in lower R&D expenditures.
Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $2.2 million as compared to $2.2 million in the year ago period and $2.3 million last quarter. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $1.8 million as compared to $1.3 million in the year ago quarter and $1.3 million last quarter. Stock base comp in the first quarter was $824,000, amortization of intangible assets was $309,000 and depreciation in amortization was $304,000.
Accounting for these items, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was a loss of $1.1 million, as compared to a loss of 1.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 and a loss of $111,000 last quarter.
GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $2.8 million or $0.18 per share, as compared to a net loss of $1.5 million or $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $1.7 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.
First quarter non-GAAP net loss was $1.6 million, so $0.10 per share, as compared to net loss of $2.4 million or $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $0.6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Share count used to compute the fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP net loss was 15.6 million shares.

In terms of balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $17.5 million in cash. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.3 million, that's down from $5.2 million last quarter. Our inventory metrics have continued to improve over last year and this quarter exceeded our targeted turns of 4X. Accounts receivable was $6.1 million, that represents a DSO of approximately every 48 days.
Now, with respect to guidance for the second quarter of 2017, we currently expect to achieve a record revenue level ranging between $12.8 million to $13.1 million.
At the midpoint, this implies year over year revenue growth of 25%. Gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between 48% and 50%. GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $8.3 million and $8.5 million and non-GAAP operating expenses between $7.1 million and $7.3 million.
Stock base comp in the second quarter will be approximately $900,000, amortization of intangible assets will be approximately $300,000 and depreciation and amortization will be approximately $400,000. Weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 15.8 million shares in the second quarter.
So, before opening the call of questions, I'd like to summarize my comments and operating objectives. First, we continue to control operating expenses and demonstrate leverage in our operating model. Second, we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter by 25% over the prior year period and set a new quarterly record. Third, we're on track to achieve our target of EBITDA breakeven by the middle of the year. Fourth, we have direct access to additional working capital exceeded with our recently filed shelf offering which has been declared effective by the SEC. And lastly, we remain focus on winning more designs and new customers in the months ahead.
With that, we'll open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Gary Mobley of Benchmark. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congrats on a strong quarter and a strong guide. A question about the pricing environment, I think it's been pretty well documented that some of your more commodity or competitors or comparables over in Taiwan had been raising prices and experiencing tight supply. And it's also my understanding that you guys have preterm and pricing schedules with customers. So, how has this overall pricing environment impacted you? Is it a situation where your ASPs are falling slower than expected or is it helping your design win traction as an alternative to these commodity memories since it might be more price comparable?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Hi, Gary. It's Narbeh. It's more -- the effect for us is more of the latter. So, as I mentioned previously, when we do engage with our customer on applications with specific solutions. The alternative for the customer is always to go the commodity route. And of course, we have to offer enough value with our solutions and ask a premium over the commodity that is just enough so the economics make sense for the customer.
So, when prices are firming up on commodity devices with the types of more in securing design wins which is good for us because as you know, this become more sticky design wins. The effect we're seeing today in terms of more immediate guides on where we ended up the quarter, like you said, is in part negotiating with the customers in the past and this recent price stability with the commodity supplier is not really affecting us that much.
Gary Mobley
Okay. As it relates to the supply environment or tight supply environment or Flash, are you affected at all by perhaps some extremely utilization rates with some of your foundry partners?
Narbeh Derhacobian
That's always a concern. Obviously, when you have supply tightening the market and you know, we've seen this before and we work very closely with our suppliers at various level and just to ensure that, you know, we can deliver to the customers. So, we're aware of it and just like any of the other memory suppliers are and we're on top of it. And right now, we're not seeing any major concerns from that part.

Gary Mobley
Okay. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my question, guys.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Suji Desilva of ROTH Capital. Your line is open.
Suji Desilva
Hi, Narbeh, hi, Ron. Congratulations on the strong results and guidance here. So, as we look at 2017's growth, we would be expecting, do you think it comes more from the consumer side, more from the industrial side or is it fairly balanced out or is there seasonality there?
Narbeh Derhacobian
You mean for the rest of the year?
Suji Desilva
Correct.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Well, I tell you, it's broad-based for us. I think we've seen -- you know, for example, we've seen some of our leading returning customers basically ramping into productions. Again, these are all the design wins that we piled up and we've been talking about on different conference calls and conferences, you know, they are beginning to ramp into production and you know, the industrial always has a longer lead time on consumer. So, I think that's the effects we're seeing. We don't see any particular market segment standing out either in a positive or a negative way.
Suji Desilva
Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then, the new products that are coming online to help you grow with EcoXip and others, are they on schedule to track to production versus where you expect it three months ago, are any coming in sooner or any perhaps getting put out a little bit? That color would be helpful.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Well, everything is on schedule. You know, we're aware. You know, the products that we taped out in the first quarter and are sampling with the early customers and I shed some color as what to expect for the rest of the year from new products tape-outs today in the call. So far, everything is on schedule.
Suji Desilva
Okay. And then a quick question for Ron. Ron, the headcount kind of expectation the end of year versus now, are you expecting to grow that count much or is that something that's relatively in place now?
Ron Shelton
You know, for the most part in place, there might be one or two ads here or there but it's effectively in place.
Suji Desilva
Okay. Two last questions. One on the China meter market. Is that one that you think has a good kind of ramp opportunity in the second half because of the potential volumes there? Is that something that comes in slowly? Any thoughts there would be helpful.
Narbeh Derhacobian
No, I wouldn't -- I -- yes. I think it's like any industrial market, it will be a slow ramp. And if we have a key milestone outside what I just talked about, we will basically communicate that. But right now, we're just seeing an increased level of sampling activity for the various industrial markets, metering being just one of them in Asia.
Suji Desilva
Okay. And then just one last clarification. Lighting, is that going to be an industrial category or a consumer category or a mix of both?
Narbeh Derhacobian
We put that in the consumer space.
Suji Desilva
Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Once again, congratulations.
Ron Shelton
Thanks, Suji.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer
Yes. Thanks, guys. And I'll add my congratulation as well. Maybe a follow up first to an earlier question. Would you be able to compare the revenue contribution from Fusion Flash, you know you have CBRam today and then maybe where you expect that kind of mix to look or what you expect it to look like exiting this year? Just to kind of give us an idea of the relative -- maybe what relative growth rates are.
Ron Shelton
Yes. Hey, Rick. This is Ron. You know, today and historically DataFlash has been about 80% of the revenue and I guess as we go through the year, you know, Narbeh talked about in his earlier comments that the standard Flash products may exit the year at 15 or around 15% of overall revenue. And Fusion will come up as we go through the year. So, I would expect DataFlash to probably come down closer to 80% and with the balance split between standard serial Flash and Fusion.

This year, CBRam or -- and EcoXip aren't a material contributor to revenue and those will start to ramp sometime in 2018.
Rick Schafer
Okay. Thanks. And then, speaking of CBRam, I mean, when we would look out toward earlier '18 or when you expect it to start ramping, where do you see initial traction being the strongest there, you know, if you're talking about and end market, like industrial or consumer PC elsewhere?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes. So, again, I would focus more on the product families, right. So, if I look the Mavriq which is I think what you're referring to, the Mavriq family, our main focus especially with this new camera module specific product that we taped-out is the camera module market. Obviously, we've been getting qualified sampling with some contract manufacturers, as I mentioned in that area, just to seed the market. And right now, we're engaged with all the top tier camera module manufacturers, showcasing what we have today and also letting them know what's the new camera module specific product which is about to -- we should have samples of that late in the year.
So, once we have a design win, I would be able to shed more color on that but our focus is going to be there in terms of the camera module market in 2018.
Rick Schafer
Got it. Thanks, guys. That's it for me.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill
Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and I echo the congratulations. So, a question on the EcoXip product. Can you talk a little bit about the -- you know, the ASP for the product and the density for the product, you know, relative to the Fusion family? I would assume it would have higher ASPs potentially, maybe if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Sure. So, first, in terms of density, there is the first EcoXip product that we produced, we have samples again, either a 32Mb. And you're right, typically, the EcoXip products are targeting higher density applications. So -- and I mentioned, we're taping out the 128-megabyte version of the EcoXip this quarter. And really, the way we decide what to tape out when is really the engagement with lead high volume customers to understand timing of when they are releasing their SoCs of MCUs to intercept with that.
In terms of ASPs, naturally, they are higher than the Fusion because, first of all, just with the memory. So, it's a bigger die, a discrete higher density, higher ASP. But also, more importantly, the business model of EcoXip is slightly different than the Fusion. The Fusion typically is sold as component package device. We some opportunities that we sell Fusion as a Known Good Die. But in the case of EcoXip, the equation is reverse. So, we'd be selling that more in terms of Known Good Dies as a system in package applications.
And so, as such, the cost of the package and the -- you know, the final test is not a part of the product. So, average ASPs, I would say, you know, it's -- you're looking above $0.50, $0.60. Again, it depends on the customers and volumes and so forth. Whereas, Fusion family on the average ASPs, you're looking at, you know, less than -- you know, close to half or less than that.
Rajvindra Gill
All right. That's helpful. And we talk a little bit about -- you know, on the Fusion Flash business. In the last quarter, you said that you had shipped about 20 million Fusion Flash units and you expect that to double in 2017. Are we still on track there and can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific demand drivers for the Fusion Flash product this year? Has the design mix been changing for you?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes. So, the main driver again is vastly operated connected devices like Bluetooth and so forth. In terms of being on track for the half year, the answer is yes. If I look at volume shipment quarter Q1 of '17 versus '16, we're up significantly over last year for this quarter. So, we're on track for -- to hit the numbers that we talked about in 2017.

Rajvindra Gill
And the last question for me, Ron, in terms of the balance sheet, how do we think about deleveraging? I think in the past you had said that you were -- you know, there's a goal to pay down the debt. How do we think about debt repayment and going forward? Thank you.
Ron Shelton
Sure. So, the terms that's amotizing right now is amortizing about a million seven a quarter. So, you know, from -- we talked about getting EBITDA positive in the middle of this year you take that combined with, you know, growing revenues, growing profitability, you know, managing working capital well, we have enough capital today to service debt and run the business.
Rajvindra Gill
Thank you.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from Orin Hirschman of AIGH Investment Partners. Your line is open.
Orin Hirschman
Hi. How are you?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Hi, Orin. How are you?
Orin Hirschman
Good. Okay. I'm good. I'll ask you two question for now. One is, you had mentioned in the passing of the NXP, what you are working on with NXP, with Qualcomm. Is that -- were you referring to reference designs or were you referring to actually the first early design wins? Sorry, I wasn't clear on that.
Narbeh Derhacobian
So, we talked about this. In fact, there was a press release on this as well, the joint press release with NXP. So, it's a design win for EcoXip product. And again, this one, because it's -- really the product is being sold two ways to the customer. In one case, it's going to be as a Known Good Die to be attached within the package with MCUs and the second case, it would be a part of reference designs. So, it's a combination of what you just mentioned.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. But that first design was what you were -- design win was what you were referring to?
Narbeh Derhacobian
No. So, what -- in case of the EcoXip, the customer has to incorporate basically the interface to be able to take full advantage of the EcoXip inside their SOC or MCUs.
Orin Hirschman
Okay.
Narbeh Derhacobian
So, in the case of several customers and actually being one of them, they have done that.
Orin Hirschman
Okay.
Narbeh Derhacobian
In fact, we designed the part in collaboration with several competing customers like NXP.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. And just going back to the camera modules, were you actually in - even if its very small volumes today or are you actually in the commercial module?
Narbeh Derhacobian
No, we're not. So, what we did is we were able to showcase the benefits of the Mavriq platform with a large contract manufacturer in the camera module. And together, we went to bid on a camera module business of a large Chinese camera module maker. What happened is the camera module marker decided to go with a different contract manufacturer. So, we, Adesto, lost that opportunity. But what it ended up happening is we realized it's a huge opportunity and the Mavriq platform is ideally suited for this application today and where it's going two, three, four years down the road. So, we put a concerted effort to design solutions specific for that end market.
And since then, this was about a year ago, we've been engaged with other contract manufacturers as well as module makers to kind of prepare them for this new product that we'll be releasing end of the year.
Orin Hirschman
And is the driver there the module maker or is the driver the actual end customer that makes what's in the handset?
Narbeh Derhacobian
For -- the first one is the module maker. Benefits is -- can't come to the module maker, the contract manufacturer or the end camera user because end of today, we're using the cost of embedding camera modules in gadgets.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Narbeh for any closing remarks.

Narbeh Derhacobian

Narbeh Derhacobian
Thank you, Leanne and welcome to everyone joining us today. I am pleased to report to ended the year with record revenue and gross margin. We achieved our goal of growing second half revenue 15% over the first half, as revenue in the fourth quarter grew approximately 10% sequentially to $12.3 million, as we continued to see a strengthening in orders across our end markets and product families.
Gross margin expanded 500 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter to a record 50.6%. These results reflect an increasing number of design wins ramping into production and are expanding new product revenue, combined with benefits from improved product mix and our continued focus on reducing product cost.
Additionally, we sequentially decreased operating expenses over $1 million in the quarter, which contributed to a significant improvement in EBITDA and earnings per share. These results further validate our ability to achieve our goal of EBITDA breakeven by middle of this year.
I am also pleased to report that Adesto secured a record number of new design wins amounting to 127 in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 280, more than double the design wins secured in 2016.

In terms of total annual revenue run rate potential for our 2016 design wins when reached to full production and as always subject to market conditions and customersâ production timelines, the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a record at $21.2 million, also more than doubling when compared to 2015. Over 70% of 2016 design wins were with new customers, reflecting our efforts to further diversify and expand our customer base and increase our market penetration.
From an end market perspective for the full year approximately 43% of design wins were secured in industrial markets and 31% in consumer, whereas the total dollar value opportunity was approximately 42% industrial and 45% consumer.
Notable design wins included two new Smart Power Meter platforms in China and Japan. In addition, we are seeing significant activity at large tier-1 you want consumer customers with whom we expect to be shipping to production volumes across multiple platforms later this year.
In short, we finished 2016 with a solid momentum that are expect to contribute to our growth in 2017 and beyond. The actual revenue breakdown in the fourth quarter by end market at our top 20 revenue customers consisted of 52% from industrial market, 30% from consumer market and the remaining 19% being spread across communication, medical, automotive and computing.
With that, let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail. Our DataFlash family remains the largest revenue contributor, reflecting our leading position in high volume Smart Meter market. These products are ideally suited for data logging applications such as meters and are also using health and fitness tracking, as well as home automation.
In 2016, we began migrating our DataFlash family, the 1845 [ph] series to 65 nanometer node, with the first product migrated in our 64 megabit DataFlash. We provided early samples of these product in the second half of 2016 and as I've mentioned in the past, the migration to 65 nanometer provides a better cost structure for Adesto and allows us to add new features in the product.
The next product that is targeted to move to 65 nanometer is the 32 megabit DataFlash, which we expect to take part [ph] in the first quarter of this year. During the quarter, we also continue to make progress sampling our 8035 DataFlash product that are designed specifically for the Asia smart meter market. These product family provides a lower-cost alternative with a more constrained feature set, as compared to our Standard DataFlash family and is more suitable for cost conscious metering and industrial market, such as the ones in China.
Turning to our FusionFlash family, we continue to experience increasing revenue growth for this product, which are well-suited for battery-operated consumer devices requiring low power and extended operating life.
As I mentioned last quarter, our FusionFlash device was chosen by Tile, a maker of world's best selling Bluetooth tracker product. These products have been ramping throughout the quarter as expected. This particular customer success story exemplifies the fast ramp to production from design wins, which is why we launched an initiative to focus on consumer IoT markets a year ago.
Itâs also worthwhile to look back at the Fusion family in more detail, because I believe it highlights one of the underlying themes of our company. Back in 2013, we worked with CSR, which is now Qualcomm to understand the issues facing Bluetooth low energy system that run on a battery. We identified the problem in the systems related to commodity flash memory in terms of the ability of these devices to work in a energy constraint environment.
We further discovered that this is not a customer specific issue, but more of a broader Bluetooth low-energy application problem. Our Fusion family was designed to solve this problem. The first samples were available in late 2013, the first design wins occurred in early 2014.

Now if you look at our unit shipment, we shipped less than 2 million units in 2014 and in 2016 we shipped over 20 million units. For 2017 we expect to double unit shipment again as compared to 2016.
As evidence by the rapid ramp in shipments, Fusion has become our fastest-growing product family. I believe this illustrates our company thesis and that the new era of connected devices is striving for optimized memory solutions that address specific problems facing system design wins.
In consumer market these are more rapidly realized, while in industrial markets it takes longer to ramp from design wins.
Now if you look at our EcoXiP product family, you would see similar parallel to the Fusion story. We introduced this product in the second half of 2016 and expect to experience a similar ramping trend over the coming years.
This product family was designed in close collaboration with several leading MCU and system-on-a-chip customers who were facing issues integrating embedded non-volatile memory advanced node for code execution and execute-in place application.
I've mentioned on our last earnings call, we launched this product in September of 2016 and since that time have been receiving strong market acceptance. Early samples of EcoXiP have been provided to customers and have gained validation from leading companies such as NXP, who is supporting the EcoXiP interface in the future MCU product.
We believe the total opportunity for this product family could surpass FusionFlash for a few reasons. First, this product ramp in correlation with platforms and reference designs, which are characteristics of MCU based embedded system.
Today MCUs normally top out at 8 to 16 megabit of internal Flash, but IP based Internet-of-Things devices often need more cost base to support multiple protocol, requiring an external Flash device, as well as extensive internal SRAM. EcoXiP solved this problem by delivering the performance needed for code execution with only one device.
EcoXiP is also packed which features that are ideal for remote battery-operated embedded systems such as concurrent read and write functionality that allows over the air updates more efficiently and with better performance. Our EcoXiP products can be deployed in many types of IoT and embedded devices, including wearables, medical monitors, point of sales controller, sensors and beacons and so on.
The second reason we believe EcoXiP offers a potentially a higher larger revenue opportunity is because this product demands a higher ASP than the Fusion family, as a result of the higher memory density than Fusion by delivering performance and power benefits to the embedded system. So even at the same level of unit, EcoXiP offers a higher return on revenue across broad number of targeted products and applications beyond the consumer market.
Today, the first EcoXiP product is entering the market at 32 megabit, we expect to introduce higher density EcoXiP products later in 2017. For 2017, specifically, we expect the revenue contribution from EcoXiP to be modest, but the expect the ramp to be more significant exiting the year into 2018.
During the quarter we introduced our new Mavriq family which utilizes our CBRAM technology. The Maverick digital security series sets a new milestone for resistive RAM write endurance and features hack-resistant one-time programmable security registers. To date, Adesto is the only company selling resistive RAM discrete memory products, with reliability features that rivals the more mature floating gate technology.
This latest addition to our CBRAM based product offers system designers, low-power operation, excellent endurance and features to enable better security in IoT and other connected devices.
The Mavriq DS series performs read and write operation with up to four times less power than competitive solutions, and the ultra-deep power down mode uses as much as 50% - 50 times less power. These new products also provide over hundred thousand write cycle of endurance across full temperature and voltage range.

Additionally, I mentioned last quarter that our Mavriq product has been qualified on a camera module for smart phones and tablets. As you know, it is a very large market opportunity that we estimate to be 1.5 billion units in 2017 and growing to more than 2 billion units in 2020.
Today, more than half of these markets contain double EEPROM less than 32 kilobit. The trend is for the market to go to, 64 128 and 256 kilobit devices. We believe this opportunity becomes more attractive for Adesto's Mavriq family as the density requirement increase because the CBRAM based EEPROM devices such as Mavriq will become more cost-effective than traditional double EEPROM.
We are currently working to secure design wins for the application at our - the market entry point and we expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters.
Let me take a minute to reiterate our CBRAM started and go forward outlook for this industry-leading devices. First, and as many of you know, Adesto is the first company to successfully commercialize a resistive RAM technology, having shipped millions of production parts to customers. Our Conductive Bridging RAM technology is a breakthrough technology platform that overcomes a critical power barrier needed for IoT edge.
Our CBRAM products are adaptable for broad range of applications from medical devices and appliances, to wearables and smartphone. It enables 10 to 100 times less energy consumption than today's leading memory technologies without sacrificing performance and reliability.
We continue to believe the unit volume for our CBRAM product will be tied to the growth and trajectory of connected devices due to the fact that all end market applications require smart memory, as well as other features that CBRAM offers.
In the past our R&D focus has been to solve some of the most challenging problems that typically prohibit companies from bringing to market solutions based on a new revolutionary technology, such as CBRAM. We believe the most difficult technical challenges in the area are behind us, which helped us contribute to lower R&D spending in the quarter.
Going forward, we are focusing our efforts and resources on seeking near-term revenue opportunities for CBRAM technologies best suited to these application-specific memory solution.
Lastly, in terms of our Standard Serial Flash product family, we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various high volume opportunities in computing and consumer end market.
We are making solid in growth in design wins with Tier 1 ODMs, including opportunities at leading notebook and tablet manufacturers. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on this product group and expect to get volume orders in the first half of 2017 with more meaningful revenues contribution in the second half.
For the full year, we anticipate revenue contribution from this product approach approximately 15% of total revenue, which represent a significant underlying growth rate for the family.
In closing, I believe we have taken proper steps over the past year to strengthen our financial position and balance sheet, while focusing on driving top line revenue. Growth in 2017 will be driven by an increasing number of design wins ramping into production, as well as a higher contribution from new product as we expand our market share of rapidly growing IoT market across a broad number of end market applications.
As we look more specifically in the first quarter, we anticipate our revenue to reflect expected seasonality, primarily from our consumer end market and the second quarter anticipated to return to strong growth and reach a new quarterly revenue record.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Ron to review the fourth quarter financial results in more detail, as well as more details on our first quarter outlook. Ron?

Ron Shelton
Thanks, Narbeh and thanks everyone for attending our call. Revenue in the fourth quarter ended December 31, of 2016 was $12.3 million, thatâs a increase of about 10% from $11.2 million in the third quarter of '16 and a little more than 4% from $11.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a record 50.6%, that's compared to 48.1% in the third quarter of 2016 and 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in our gross margins was due primarily to a favorable product mix from the sale of higher margin products combined with continued focus on reducing product cost.
This quarter represents the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin above our target model of 45%. For 2017 we expect gross margins to remain in the high 40s, but on a quarter-to-quarter basis they may fluctuate 100 to 200 basis points.
Longer term, gross margins will continue to be supported from new products with higher value-added content, further cost reduction initiatives and migrations to the lower process nodes..
In addition, we're currently experiencing a favorable pricing environment and we anticipate the pricing pressure in 2017 will be subdued. GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $7.8 million, that's compared to $8.8 million in the prior quarter and $7 million in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $6.7 million, thatâs compared to $7.7 million last quarter and $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2017 we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain relatively flat when compared to the full year of 2016.
Operating expenses in the quarter were well below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to a $1 million sequential decrease in R&D spending. So looking at fourth quarter non-GAAP OpEx in more detail. As we previously discussed non-GAAP research and development expenses were $3 million, thatâs compared with $4 million in the prior quarter and $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
As Narbeh previously indicated in his comments with some of the key challenges in CBRAM development behind us we are able to realize lower levels of research and development spending during the quarter.
non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $2.3 million, that's compared with $2.5 million last quarter, and $1.9 million in the year ago period. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $1.3 million, that's compared to $1.2 million last quarter, and $1.1 million in the year ago quarter.
Stock based comp in the fourth quarter was $835,000. Amortization of intangible assets was $308,000 and depreciation and amortization was $303,000. Accounting for these items, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was nearly breakeven with a loss of $111,000. That's a significant improvement as compared to a loss of $2 million in the third quarter of 2016 and a loss of $494,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter '16 was $1.7 million or $0.11 per share, thatâs compared to a net loss of $4.1 million or $0.27 per share in third quarter of '16 and a net loss of $3.3 million or $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP net loss was $0.6 million or $0.04 per share, that's compared to a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.19 per share in the third quarter of 2016 and a non-GAAP net loss of $0.9 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Share count used to compete the fourth quarter GAA[ and non-GAAP net loss was 15.3 million shares. In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to show the benefits of an ongoing focus on liquidity ending the quarter with $19.7 million in cash.
As discussed earlier, in addition, the near breakeven and EBITDA we experienced significant benefits from an improved balance sheet metrics. Furthermore, we expect to increase this quarter amendments for a existing credit facility which will further enhance our liquidity.

Inventory the fourth quarter was $5.2 million, that's down from $8 million last quarter and we expected inventory turnover metrics will continue to improve in the coming quarters and we expect to get to our targeted terms models for that better in 2017. Accounts receivable at $6.1 million, that represents a DSO of approximately 40 days.
So a couple of comments before reviewing guidance for the first quarter and opening up for the questions. First I want to inform our investors that we plan to file shelf registration with the SEC in the coming weeks, which will allow us from time to time to offer equity and debt securities under the shelf registration.
We donât have any immediate plans to offer a seller securities under the registration statement, but believe that the matter of good business practice and provides us greater flexibility going forward to have a registration on file.
Now let me turn to guidance, for the first quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to range between $11.1 million to $11.3 million. That reflects expected seasonality primarily related to our consumer end market. Despite the expected seasonality our guidance at the midpoint plays year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 of approximately 10%.
And as Narbeh mentioned, we expect to return to growth and achieve record revenue in the second quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to range between 48% and 50%, and GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $8.3 million $8.5 million with non-GAAP expenses between $7.2 million and $7.4 million.
Stock-based comp in the first quarter will be approximately $850,000. Amortization of intangible assets will be approximately $300,000 and depreciation and amortization will be approximately $300,000. Weighted average shares outstanding are expected be approximately 15.4 million shares for the first quarter.
And lastly, I wan to reiterate that we continue to expect to be â to EBITDA breakeven in the middle of 2017.
So before opening the call to questions, I just wanted to summarize out comments during this call, the accomplishment from last quarter. So, first, we did experienced record quarterly revenue since we've been public and for the first time in our history we had gross margin in excess of 50%. There are sequential decline of 13% non-GAAP operating expenses, which is EBITDA of nearly breakeven.
We had positive cash flow from operations. We saw significant improvements in our working effici3ency.
So with that, we'll open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about your imply guidance for the second quarter in order to achieve record quarterly revenue that implies roughly or at least 10% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.
And so I am wondering about your confidence level in achieving that, what drives it, is it seasonality, is it a couple product cycle ramps, any details that would be helpful?
Ron Shelton
Yes. Hey, Gary. Itâs Ron. Thanks for the question. I think when we talked about seasonality in the first quarter, so thatâs what we're seeing and then the growth in the second quarter you know, then we expect revenue in the second quarter to be higher than that over the fourth quarter, as is driven by a number of thins. I think, one, those customers politically expect â experience some seasonality to start coming back off that in Q2.
There are new design wins that we expect and are ramping into Q2 and there is some new customers that are consuming the ramp, and additional new products. So I think itâs a whole basket of things that are coming together and I think speeds off some of the design wins activity we've seen over the last couple of years. And we're starting to see that to show up in the topline - into that topline.

Gary Mobley
Okay. And with depreciation, amortization running about $3000 per quarter in the likelihood of achieving adjusted EBITDA breakeven in mid-2017 that must assume that were going to see 50% gross margins in Q3 and about 10% revenue growth. Am I reading those variables right?
Ron Shelton
Yeah, I mean, you know, we're going to guide, we mentioned in the call, high 40s in gross margin, we did a little over 50 this quarter and gross margin we expect to see other than that 48%, 49%, 50% range through the quarter. And again, we expect to bounce back in revenue in Q2 higher than Q4 and see growth and we expect to grow through the year.
Gary Mobley
Okay. One last question on the product front, should we think about you know, EcoXiP [ph] being a successor to Fusion and that perhaps in some design wins, Bluetooth for example, you might be going forward with EcoXiP versus Fusion or are we talking about an incremental addressable market opportunity here?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Hi, Gary. Itâs Narbeh. No, its not â EcoXiP is not replacement or its not going to cannibalize the Fusion. They are going after different market opportunities. Fusion we are expecting as I mentioned too actually â we are expecting the unit shipments to double in '17 over '16 and we are planning to introduce new Fusion family product in the second half of the year.
EcoXiP is target more of a companionship for MCUs and kind of them, as you think about it also on a density perspective, EcoXiP tends to be higher density, Fusion tends to be lower density.
So EcoXiP is really designed in a market and applications where large amount of code is needed to make that node intelligence and over the year our data reporting, interaction, executing from the controller or the SoC a far amount importance for that node.
So today, you think about where that market is stated, its either sales by embedded Flash in older or current MCUs and we believe that embedded Flash gets more and more expensive as MCUs are going into more advanced node and more code is needed, as I mentioned in my presentation that ability to support multiple protocols, the size of the memory starts to explode and with the economic stuff embedding starts not make sense, thatâs where EcoXiP release design to bring solutions to the embedded systems.
Gary Mobley
Okayâ¦.
Narbeh Derhacobian
So it will be on incremental, a long answer, but it would be in addition to the growth we starting to see.
Gary Mobley
Okay. Thatâs helpful. Congratulations on a good finish to the year. Thanks, guys.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.
Suji Desilva
Hi, Narbeh. Hi, Ron. My y congratulations on a strong finish to the year. So and the second quarter recovering strongly here, can you dig a little bit deeper and talk whether there's certain end markets that help drives that recovery specifically or whether it's a broad-based feed into the second quarter?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Its not one particular thing, I think if you think about it, one of our â its across the board. So if you look at our big revenue contributor which is DataFlash thatâs coming back out not only just in industrial market, but also â we also DataFlash in consumer market for data logging application.
Fusion will kind of - is very consumer-oriented, so that we had â that impacted in Q1 for the expected seasonality, that also coming back and also I mentioned about some of the Standard Serial products that we introduced in the second half, that we've been getting qualified and computing more kind of a traditional market. We are expecting growth to start to ramp, because that just goes through the normal cycle of qualification with the SoftCons [ph] in Asia. So all that is going to contribute to the growth that we are expected to see in Q2.

Suji Desilva
Okay. Thatâs very helpful color there. And then as we look at the full year '17, we saw in '16 increase after half of a 15% is thatâs the typical linearity we should expect in the given year with '16 - something very anomaly in the â where the year plays out?
Ron Shelton
Hey, Suji. Itâs Ron. I donât â its hard to say whether thatâs typical or not. I think the way we're seeing this year rollout is again its seasonality Q1, its step up in Q2 to the factors that Narbeh reviewed, you know, beyond the Q4 number and then kind of EBITDA breakeven in the middle of the year, so which implies further growth.
You know, whether 15% kind of second-half versus first half is a standard trend, I wouldnât characterize as that.
Suji Desilva
Okay. Just wondered since you now over there. And then lastly are the design wins in the fourth quarter very strong after third quarter 120, is that the new left baseline for what you guys can do on a quarterly basis, i.e. kind of a 500 design win run rate or were there some particular spike happen in the fourth quarter that was worth calling out there?
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes. I was sure, you were going to ask that question. Soâ¦
Suji Desilva
It jumped out of me Narbeh.
Narbeh Derhacobian
So look in the past we've also indicated that there is two things important with design wins, one is the number of design wins, the other one is the dollar â revenue potential of the design wins.
So I've also mentioned this on all the earnings call, whenever we've met with investors, donât be surprised that we come and report a lower numbers for design wins, but the dollar content would be up, because that deliberately focus in some high volume opportunities that â and that really give up higher dollar content design wins and of course those also take more time to bring home.
So to answer your question is, we are expecting high number of design wins, but I think the matrix you want to look at exactly the dollar content that we'd be reporting, thatâs going to be the key, because thatâs a indication of the top line growth for the company.
Suji Desilva
Okay, great. Thanks for that color. Thanks, guys.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Company.
Rajvindra Gill
Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats as well on good results and good execution, thatâs great to see. A question on the ECO chip business â ECO chip business. So Narbeh, you talked about that business growing kind of rapidly, you're seeing a lot of low power, battery-operated products, such as Tile kind to use your usual power memory, what other products can we think of that â that are battery operator or maybe if could characterize design that in terms driving the ECO chip business going forward?
Narbeh Derhacobian
The [indiscernible] really the Fusion family, right, thatâs why we could see the ones that have extend the batter life of their system. The EcoXiP as I mentionedâ¦
Rajvindra Gill
Yes, I am sorry for future products, sorry about that.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes, the EcoXiP was introduced to be really a companion chip to use. So if you think about where MCUs are used in general, you can think about all that, this is why we call that â we're excited about the opportunity because itâs more of a platform design. So the business model for the EcoXiP is the following.
In one model we would be selling the non-good dye [ph] to microcontroller players or system-on-a-chip players and then they would go into their end market. In another model we would be setting into a reference design for that microcontroller ourselves.
So the end markets for EcoXiP is very broad, starting with industrial market, consumer, and communication market as well. For example, one of the areas we see or we looking at an opportunity with EcoXiP with that microcontroller is more of the high and fitness tracker which requires more often intelligence that we see today in some of the business trackers which are out there.

So, my point in pilot - making a pilot between the Fusion and EcoXiP was the following, is that, you know. If we were sitting down, and when Fusion was first interviewed, we would be asking the questions, where is the revenue, where are the design wins, why is the design wins ramping into production in 2014.
So we went from introducing the is used in the product in '13 to having some design wins in '14 and went from 2 million units shipped for the whole of '14 to 20 million in 2016 and 2017 expected to be over 40 million. So my point is that this growth of application specific memory that require design wins and then ramp is unlike your commodity situation where you know end market and you are going â digging based on price and you're ramping.
So we are expecting EcoXiP to experience similarly if not better ramp that we probably saw with Fusion because itâs a more of a platform play, rather than specifically in case of Fusion with the Bluetooth low-energy sort of winter.
Rajvindra Gill
So just going back to Fusion, you're seeing growth of these low power battery-operated products, such as the Tile, what other kind of products are you seeing in the marketplace that are â these IoT connected devices that are battery-operated, they donât need to have very low power and a small footprint compared to traditional delivery services?
Narbeh Derhacobian
So Bluetooth headset, think about Bluetooth and battery, and chances that we are â they are target markets or our current Fusion opportunity. So Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth remote control, as you know remote controls are getting more intelligence, they requiring more codes, Bluetooth speakers. So you know, thatâs the â itâs quite broad where Bluetooth is used in terms of end markets.
Rajvindra Gill
So the other question I have, and I'll hop back in queue, as it is more of a broader question. But, you know, our view is that embedded Flash with microcontroller is going to have difficult in scaling below 20 nanometer and the major microcontroller companies like NXCI [ph] which you have a relationship with, micro chip et cetera are going to seek alternatives to embedded Flash and possibly use your ECO Chip or which does the rewrite cycles concurrently and generate less power.
Can you talk a little bit about the timing of that, the inflection point of that and what's been the conversation like with the microcontrollers players as they start to confirm this reality? Thank you.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Yes. So depending on the microcontroller company, you can see its â there is certain microcontroller players are very successfully are in the market with more â if you think about not at the leading edge of [indiscernible] lagging that, more of a 8k sort of microcontroller that day they are embedded Flash solutions that they use at 130 nanometer, 180 nanometer, even 90 nanometer, 65 nanometer node
Some of the other microcontrollers players which are more focused on 32 bit microcontrollers, they are more â passing more source of IT course in the MCU, all migrating to 28 and below and exactly what you said, it becomes extremely expensive to embed Flash in MCUs at 28 and below node. And those are our target markets.
When they are going to ramp off, we provided samples to some of the players in this space, so there you can see is an SOC. We re expecting to get - from our perspective we are expecting to some modest revenue on EcoXiP in 2017, but the big lump for us is going to start in 2018 and beyond. And I am expecting that will be driven by the events we use also ramping in volume at their end. So I think by extension the ramp for MCUs would be around that product, beyond that product.
Rajvindra Gill
Okay. Great, Thank you. Congrats again.

And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.

Josh Buchalter
Hello. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Rick. Congratulations on to solid end to the year. You know mentioned that there is lower investment in CBRAM that led to the OpEx decline in the fourth quarter.
And I guess I was wondering if you could â and you also mentioned that OpEx should be flat year-over-year in 2017, yes I was wondering if you could talk to maybe how you view investing for growth, while also managing profitability with the EBITDA breakeven and kind of how your thoughts are on OpEx going forward?
Ron Shelton
So we as an innovator, we must invest to grow, in absolute investing R&D to grow and thatâs an absolute month for us. So if you look at the history of CBRAM, when we first took this technology to market years ago, our main goal was first take the technology from research mode and take it to the market, which we did and we were fully expecting that we were going to have issues in the market with the technology that we have to fix.
And over the years one by one our R&D group has not found these challenges and today with the latest introduction of an average [ph] which we made in Q4, we clearly have nothing to or make excuses around how reliable the technologies and how much benefit it brings in the area that it shines which is performance and power over today's solution.
So having said that, that means that trying to solve this technical challenges, which is a big part of our IP by the way, now we do not need to invest as significantly as we have in the past to continue and maintain and bring products to market based on that.
The most expensive part of R&D for any silicon company is the silicon itself, you know, designed especially for us which we are not that - our products are not that leading edge of Moore's law, our design, R&D expenses, our mass R&D expenses are not as much as what you view in some of the microprocessor or SOC companies.
So the most expensive part of R&D for us is that now we are lacking the market opportunity that we see in front of us are going to drive our R&D resources to the direction where we can continue to innovate and yet we can eye on managing the offer.
Josh Buchalter
Thank you. Thatâs helpful. And then, I was hoping you could comment on the competitive environment, we've seen the headline recently that a major NOR Flash player is looking to deemphasize the business and you also mentioned that the pricing environment is been better. So I was hoping if you could just maybe comment on how you're â how itâs looking when you're going up against sockets and how you little bit secured metal pricing?
Ron Shelton
Yes, so that absolutely right. We saw that and in fact, a year ago we were mentioning that the NOR landscape is to going to change, especially the NOR market that we are focusing into, are more low density NOR and showing off â there is one of the major players has announced end up like for low density products which are market where we compete in.
So that and also capacity for [indiscernible] we're seeing that prices are also beginning to firm up in the market and it creates two things for us. So the number one we have a Standard Flash family which directly competes with a standard NOR player.
But more importantly our value added solutions, such as the Fusion and EcoXiP and DataFlash in cases that in the past I mentioned where we do lose an opportunity because you know, the customer believes that the premium that we ask for our products giving us a bit gross margin may not necessarily make economic sense for them. That equation is beginning to fade or more towards us now because prices are also firming up.
So I think itâs a good thing, I also believe that big volume in IoT from a flash perspective is not the IoT that we focus in, the edge of IoT is not the related to NAND flash, its really mid to low density NOR which our populating these connected small node. And I think in general itâs a much more favorable environment for us than previous year.

Josh Buchalter
Thank you. Thatâs helpful. And congratulations again,
Ron Shelton
Thanks, Josh.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Aaron Martin with AIGH Investment Partners.
Aaron Martin
Hi, Ron. Hi, Narbeh. Congratulations on the quarter. Most of my questions have been â most of the question have answered, but a thing I wanted to ask you, within your design wins metrics with IPO, I am helpless, I guess to understand that how that â the time line is in design wins to revenue, there has been tremendous growth obviously in design wins which hasnât shown up in the revenue. So help me understand, when that will transit to revenue growth?
Ron Shelton
Well, I think some of that Aaron its not there â I think some of that has shown up, I think it was the last earnings call when we did look at some of our - kind of 2014 design wins I believe and 2015 design wins.
What we saw two things, number one, we asked the question has customer that it has pulled out the design wins, have they come back and said look, they are not ramping their product, and nothing that was significant in terms of volume and dollar content for us appears, which means the customers have either delayed or they have issues around it.
So I'll give you an example, we have Amgen as a customer, he called the design wins two years ago, and I think we have a very young investor on the callâ¦
Aaron Martin
He is excited as I am.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Okay. And so they had some issues and that particular opportunity that we were going after by the other design wins is software and FDA approval and thatâs been delayed, delayed, delayed.
So thatâs taken over two years and we're seeing nothing in production and not even in our forecast now because of all the delay. On the other hand, company like Tile, went from design wins to production in six months.
Aaron Martin
Maybe thatâs discussion differently, over the last you know, quarter or two would you look at the revenue that came in, when was those design wins based?
Ron Shelton
Hey, Aaron, itâs Ron. Itâs a good question. I think the - some for example, you know, Tile being one would have been within the last year, others that are sitting in there [indiscernible] is our biggest customer could have been over the last two or three years, right.
I mean, so itâs going to vary by each individual customer and each individual program. So I wish I could give you more granularity in terms of when these things hit, but I just donât have that information in front of me.
Narbeh Derhacobian
You know, one of the difficulties we have in answering this, clearly, that percentage is a follow on. We have an existing customer, such as our Smart Meter customers, that took new design wins with their new DataFlash family. If the customer â the customer also buys through distribution, so from us after we secure the design wins, the product is shifted to the distributor and then it goes to the customers and system.
The customer has an existing program already running on the same part number, not in new design wins, so I am designing from years, few years ago that uses the same part number. So from our perspective we're kind of lying and seeing this particular part that we're shipping to the distributor is going to the old design wins or the new design wins.
I mean, we do see fluctuation it could be rising, but it is rising because of old design win is ramping or is it rising because the old design win is buying the range of new design wins and this why we have scenarios where we can actually call it out, we do call it out and in some area it becomes a little bit readiness for us to specifically say that.
Aaron Martin
Okay. I guess thatâs it from me. All the questions have been answered. Congratulations on the tremendous progress.

Narbeh Derhacobian
Thanks, Aaron.
Operator
And I am showing any further questions in the queue. I will like to turn the call back to Narbeh Derhacobian for final remarks.
Narbeh Derhacobian
Thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased with our performance across our business throughout the fourth quarter and we expect definitely through the second half 2016. And we believe our growing base of design wins will continue to drive the growth in 2017. As a reminder, we will be participating e in the upcoming ROTH Capital Conference on March 13 and 14, Dana Point, California. We appreciate your time to join the call today and look forward to providing updates on our next earnings call. Have a great day.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today October 27, 2016.I would know like to turn over the call to Leanne Sievers of Shelton Group investor relations. Leanne, please go ahead.Leanne SieversGood afternoon and welcome to Adesto Technologies' third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I am Leanne Sievers, Executive Vice President of Shelton Group, Adesto's Investor Relations firm. Joining me today are Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto's President and CEO and Ron Shelton, Chief Financial Officer.Before I turn the call over to Narbeh, I would like to remind our listeners that during the course of this conference call, the company will provide financial guidance, projections, comments and other forward-looking statements regarding future market developments, the future financial performance of the company, new products or other matters. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the final prospectus related to our initial public offering and our most recent 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.Also, the company's press release and management statements during this conference call will include discussions and certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures and related GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the company's press release and related current report on Form 8-K, which can be found at the Investor Relations section of Adesto's website at www.adestotech.com. For those of you unable to listen to the entire call at this time, a recording will be available via webcast on the company's website.And now, I will turn the call over to Adesto's President and CEO, Narbeh Derhacobian. Narbeh, please go ahead.Narbeh DerhacobianThank you Leanne and good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. I will begin with a brief overview of our financial results. Then address our design win pipeline on product development efforts that would support our future growth. I will then turn the call over to Ron to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as our fourth quarter guidance before opening the call for questions.Revenue in the third quarter was $11.2 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range of $10.8 million to $11.2 million. Our continued focus on securing design wins has begun to show evidence of success. Additionally, gross margin was 48.1% in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter above our target model of 45%. Also during the quarter, we continued to make notable progress on our design win momentum across our end markets achieving a record 65 design wins in the quarter and bringing our nine-month total to 153.In terms of the total annual revenue run rate potentials for our Q3 design wins, when reached to full production and as always subject to market conditions and customers' production time lines, the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a quarterly record of $5.8 million or $13.3 million for the nine months of 2016. This compares to $9.8 million for all of last year and $7.7 million for the full year 2014. Almost 70% of these third quarter design wins were with new customers reflecting our efforts to further diversify our customer base and increase our market penetration.From an end market perspective, approximately 48% of the third quarter design wins were in industrial markets, 20% in consumer and 17% communications and the remaining 15% in automotive, medical and computing. Similar to the trend we have seen in the past, the consumer market represented the largest portion of the total dollar value opportunity in Q3, at the 64% of the total $3.7 million with industrial representing 15% or approximately $860,000. As I mentioned earlier, our efforts to further expand into the high-volume consumer market is showing evidence of success in our results.We continue to have a growing number of design win ramps into production at leading consumer manufacturers including those for advanced remote controls, wireless beacons, Bluetooth low energy headsets, programmable electronic toys. In industrial market, design wins included new Smart Meter platforms with our leading metering customer as well as instrumentation and industrial control applications. In terms of a breakdown of our third quarter revenue by end market and looking at our top 20 revenue earners, the industrial market represented 45% of the revenue, the consumer market 37% and the remaining 18% being spread across communication, medical, automotive and computing.With that, let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail. Our DataFlash family remains the largest revenue contributor reflecting our leading position in the high volume Smart Meter and other industrial markets. During the quarter, we continued to make progress sampling our latest family of DataFlash products specifically designed for the Smart Meter market in China and are actively engaged with customers. As is expected in industrial markets, it may take some time to ramp these products at the end customers. We are nevertheless very excited about the long term opportunity for this product in China markets as we are seeing more sampling activity.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Narbeh, please go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Leanne, and good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. I will begin with a brief overview of our financial results then address our design win pipeline on product development efforts that would support our future growth. I'll then turn the call over to Ron to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as our fourth quarter guidance before opening the call for questions.Revenue in the third quarter was $11.2 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range of $10.8 to $11.2 million. Our continued focus on securing design wins has begun to show evidence of success. Additionally, gross margins was 48.1% in the quarter, representing the fifth consecutive quarter above our target model of 45%.Read MoreAlso during the quarter, we continued to make notable progress on our design win momentum across our end markets, achieving a record 65 design wins in the quarter and bringing our nine-month total to 153.In terms of the total annual revenue run rate potentials for our Q3 design wins -- when reached to full production, and as always subject to market conditions and customers' production time lines, the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a quarterly record of $5.8 million, or $13.3 million for the nine months of 2016. This compares to $9.8 million for all of last year and $7.7 million for the full year, 2014.Almost 70% of these third quarter design wins were with new customers, reflecting our efforts to further diversify our customer base and increase our market penetration. From an in market perspective, approximately 48% of the third quarter design wins were in industrial markets, 20% in consumer and 17% communications. And the remaining 15% in automotive, medical and computing.Similar to the trend we've seen in the past, the consumer market represented the largest portion of the total dollar value opportunity in Q3, at the 64% of the total, $3.7 million with industrial representing 15% or approximately $860,000. As I mentioned earlier, our efforts to further expand into the high-volume consumer market is showing evidence of success in our results.We continue to have a growing number of design win ramps into production at leading consumer manufacturers including those for advanced remote controls, wireless beacons, Bluetooth low energy headsets, programmable electronic toys. In industrial market design wins included new Smart Meter platforms with our leading metering customer as well as instrumentation and industrial control applications.In terms of a breakdown of our third quarter revenue by in-market and looking at our top 20 revenue earners, the industrial market represented 45% of the revenue, the consumer market 37% and the remaining 18% being spread across communication, medical, automotive and computing.With that, let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail. Our DataFlash family remains the largest revenue contributor, reflecting our leading position in the high volume Smart Meter and other industrial markets.During the quarter, we continued to make progress sampling our latest family of DataFlash products specifically designed for the Smart Meter market in China and are actively engaged with customers. As is expected in industrial markets, it may take some time to ramp these products at the in-customers. We are nevertheless very excited about the long term opportunities for these product in China markets as we are seeing more sampling activity.Turning to our Fusion family, we continue to gain increased traction for this product which are well suited for battery operated consumer devices requiring low power and extended battery life. As we indicated last quarter our Fusion family device was chosen by Tile, a maker of best selling Bluetooth tracker product, the Tile Slim and the Tile Mate. These personal tracking devices help users locate anything within a range of 100 feet by communicating with a Smartphone or any other iOS or android device.Memory can play a key role in determining the usability and lifetime of ultra slim and ultra low power products like Tile products and serve as a perfect example of how Adesto's Fusion Family Memory can play a critical role in improving the power and performance of these connected battery operated devices.We continue to believe that for these edge of IoT notes, application specific memory solutions such as Fusion offer a better alternative than commodity memory devices that were designed for previous eras.We have been talking about our newest family, EcoXiP over the last year. I'm pleased to say that we've formally launched this product on schedule in September. This new executing placed non volatile/ memory replaces expensive energy and efficient architectures and sets a new standard for performance, cost and powerful IoT edge devices.EcoXiP was designed from ground up, in close collaboration with leading microcontroller and system-on-a-chip suppliers, to be the ultimate solution for the main program memory in an intelligence IoT system.And, I've indicated in our September release, we have earned the validation of NXP, who's supporting the EcoXiP interface in their future microcontroller product. We have also been engaged with the entire Eco system from IT suppliers such as Synopsys to standards committees to prepare for the launch of this new device.We are seeing that more companies are recognizing how Adesto's EcoXiP memory enables designers to increase the memory throughput in code execution and system performance, thereby improving the end users' experience. We're currently sampling a 32 megabit EcoXiP device with selected customers, with a family of expanded densities planned for the future.We expect to enter full volume production in the first half of 2017 with the current device. Over the last quarter, we continued to sample Mavriq across many applications such as Bluetooth connected devices -- like, audio headsets, cameras and keyboards -- primarily in WPAN like applications.One such area that we are excited about and have been qualified for is in a camera module for phones and tablets. We expect to make more progress in this end market in the coming quarters.Also, during the quarter our second product in the CBRAM family - Moneta -- was named a finalist for the Internet Product Innovation award at Elektra 2016, which will be held in London, England in December.Products or reference designs nominated for the award were judged not only on the performance day time technical capabilities, but also how product provides true innovation in the application of IoT. We are very pleased with this recognition Adesto is gaining across our product portfolio as customers on industry acknowledge the value we offer.We've spoken about our Standard Serial Flash product family in the previous calls. As I had mentioned, we increased our activity around this product group as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher-unit-volume opportunities and further diversify our customer base and revenue. In the second quarter, we introduced four new Standard Serial Flash products covering densities from 32 meg to 128 megabit, 3-volt and 1.8-volt parts.Over this past quarter, we have gained significant traction with these products in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various opportunities in computing and consumer end markets. We're excited about seeing these prospects progress into design wins as some are higher volume opportunities in Q1 ODMs.Included in the list of new opportunities are leading notebook and tablet manufacturers and we expect to get volume orders in the first half of 2017. I am very pleased with the progress we have made on this product group and expect these products to contribute meaningful revenue in 2017.In closing, as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to maintain our positive momentum and based on the mid-point of our guidance, we are on track to meet our target of growing second half revenue by 15% over the first half.We continue to gain increasing design win momentum and are seeing evidence of our success to target high volume, high dollar value opportunities in consumer markets. I believe our ramping design wins will continue to drive growth in 2017 with additional contribution expected from our standard serial / products as well as our recently introduced EcoXiP.With that, I will now turn the call over to Ron to review the financial results in more detail as well as more details on our fourth quarter outlook.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corp. - CFO, Secretary [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Narbeh. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.I'm going to spend just a few minutes reviewing the actual results for Q3 and then we'll talk a little about guidance for Q4. Revenue in the third quarter was $11.2 million, that's up 9% sequentially when compared to the $10.3 million in second quarter of 2016. And, that's slightly higher than the $11.1 million we reported in - in the third quarter of 2015.Gross margins in the third quarter were 48.1% that compares to 46% last quarter and 45.2% in the same quarter last year. And the increase in margins this quarter is due primarily to the shift in, in product manufacturing to higher margin products. GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $8.8 million. That's compared to $8.7 million in the second quarter, and $6.3 million in the prior year quarter.Costs associated with our CBRAM technology development in the - in the third quarter was about $200,000 higher than our prior forecast. We expect those costs to moderate going forward and as a result, we expect overall operating expenses to trend slightly down in the fourth quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $7.7 million, that's compared to $7.6 million in the second quarter and $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2015.Looking at GAAP OpEx in more detail. R&D expenses were $4.4 million. That's compared to $4.2 million last quarter and $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. And the increase in year-over-year R&D spending reflect primarily, higher spending on our CBRAM technology development efforts.Sales and marketing expenses in the current quarter were $2.9 million. That's compared with $2.8 million in the second quarter and $2.1 million in the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by higher personnel costs as we fully staffed our sales and marketing groups.G&A expenses this quarter were $1.6 million.That's down slightly from the $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2016. And $920,000 in the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase in G&A primarily reflects our transition to a public Company and the costs associated with that. Stock-based comp in the third quarter was $879,000, and amortization of intangible assets was $309,000.Accounting for all these items, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a negative of $2.0 million. That's a 25% improvement when compared to a negative EBITDA of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2016. For the third quarter of 2015 we reported negative EBITDA of $430,000.GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2016 was $4.1 million or $0.27 per share. That's compared to a loss of $4.3 million or $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and a loss of $1.1 million or $1.90 a share in the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss was calculated using 15 million shares for the second and third quarters of 2016 and 565,000 shares for the third quarter of 2015.Third quarter non-GAAP net loss was $2.9 million or $0.19 per share. That's compared to a loss of $3.1 million or $0.21 per share last quarter and a loss of $1.1 million or $0.12 per share in the third quarter of 2015.In addition, we continue to show the benefits of an ongoing focus on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $21.4 million in cash and short-term investments. In addition, during the quarter, we closed on a $20 million senior secured debt facility, and that replaced our existing April 2015 facility.As expected, inventory in the third quarter was $8 million. That's down from $8.6 million last quarter, and our expectation going forward is that inventory turn over metrics will continue to improve in the coming quarters.Accounts receivable is $5 million and that represents a day sales outstanding of 45 days. Now, let me turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 16. As we indicated in our last conference call, and as Narbeh mentioned, we expect revenue in the second half of 2016 to grow approximately 15% when compared to the first half of the year and we're reaffirming that guidance today. We currently expect revenue in the fourth quarter to range between $12 million and $12.4 million.Gross margins are expected to be between 46% and 48%. And GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $8.3 million and $8.6 million, with non-GAAP expenses between $7.2 million and $7.5 million.Stock-based comp in the fourth quarter will be approximately $900,000. Amortization of intangible assets will be approximately $300,000, and D&A -- depreciation and amortization will be approximately $300,000.Finally, weighted average shares outstanding are expected to increase to approximately 15.4 million shares for the fourth quarter and that's up 15 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase is due to the vesting of approximately $430,000 used that we granted one year ago and those become available for sale beginning November 1st.With that, we'll open the call to questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Rick Schafer Oppenheimer Company. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Josh Buchalter, The Oppenheimer Company - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Josh Buchalter on for Rick and congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question.So, I was wondering if you could characterize the solid growth this quarter and the guide, if there were one or two particular verticals that drove it more so than others? To help us understand the quarter-to-quarter split.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, so, Hi Josh, so, yes the -- as we mentioned during the call, we've - about a year ago we started to focus on high volume consumer markets, especially with the Fusion Family and it was deliberate because we felt that, the kind of the high volume opportunities in IoT market for and the fastest advance to ramp would be these markets versus industrial which is we do have a strong base.So, primarily, what we said during the last call about the 15% growth and what we, we have found now and also for the fourth quarter is just the growth drivers are in the consumer market. We do see as we also mentioned, continued strength in our - in our industrial sector as well. So, it's no surprise that those two markets are the key drivers for us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Josh Buchalter, The Oppenheimer Company - Analyst [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, thank you and then I was wondering if you could help us better understand what types of applications, more specifically CBRAM and EcoXiP are gaining traction with initially and what sort of contribution can we expect in the next couple of quarters?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As before, in the CBRAM, [200-300] technologies, so the two products based on CBRAM and how we can monitor and we mentioned the traction for Mavriq is really [double PRAM] replacement today in, primarily, consumer Bluetooth low energy devices. Not necessarily as a flash memory replacement but a double PRAM replacement.As I mentioned during the call, we are seeing an interesting opportunity -- very high volume opportunity for CBRAM. We're not ready to call this a design win as of yet, but for Mavriq family we have been sampling and qualified in the memory of device for camera modules that's used in smart phones and tablets and so forth.And it's a pretty high volume opportunity. We're not again ready to talk a lot of details on that. As I mentioned during the call we hope that to move through its normal progression of going down into the designing and through production in the pipeline.EcoXiP is an interesting product because the first market for EcoXiP we believe is a system-in package, sort of as a device that will be attached to another controller and sold as an in one package. And we talked about the press release mentioned NXP as one of the early adopters here.Having said that, you can see that the applicability of this product goes across the different verticals. Because, it's essentially, it goes where the [end-field] is heading. And, we believe again, that the big opportunities there will be consumer and industrial. Again, same - because that's if you think about embedded systems where microcontrollers are used, those are the two verticals that are commonly going to.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Josh Buchalter, The Oppenheimer Company - Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, so, last one for me. I know you mentioned you were going to maybe focus on some more of the Standard Serial Flash and that might impact the margin but you know - if that didn't seem to develop is there anything that you can point to that - that's been driving the gross margin of performance for the last couple quarters. And should we continue to expect that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll take a crack at it and I'll let Ron talk about it. So, always, you know - we always you know if you look at our product portfolio, we have products at lower margins and we have products at higher margins. But we, we try to guide the business to a certain corporate blend that target both margins.So, you will not necessarily - whatever we do, if the product makes us that we sell, we would see some variations that you've seen for example in this case it ended up to be slightly higher than what we were targeting, just so happens that we shipped more at the higher margin versus the lower margin one. The standards here of Flash products we introduced, these are products that are going into more mature markets, like computing and so forth and I mentioned notebooks and tablets. And there - in order to get to full RAM production, you need to go through a standard, very well established set of procedures.You need to get samples, qualified by the motherboard manufacturers, be qualified at the OEM in Asia. So, we're going through this check list of processes and we expect the products that were introduced in media this year, to start contributing to revenue in Q4 but also more tangible ones in 2017.But, we're tracking a lot of high volume opportunities as you can imagine from - if you're looking at notebooks and tablets and PCs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corp. - CFO, Secretary [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey, hey Josh, this is Ron, just to - to add on to that, I think more specifically in this quarter and Narbeh touched on some of the design wins ramping into production and those were really Fusion based products. You know, which are really targeted for low power applications.And, and those generally have a higher margin than certainly standard products. So, we had a shift in mix. There was a higher percentage of the Fusion products for this quarter, so that drove gross margins up higher.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Josh Buchalter, The Oppenheimer Company - Analyst [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK thanks and that's very helpful and congratulations on the progress.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Mobley of Benchmark, your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, The Benchmark Company, LLC - Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi guys. Hi Leanne, how are you? I just wanted to start asking some questions about 2017. I know you're not going to give any specific guidance on the revenue for 2017.But, if you could - could you at least speak about the puts and takes with respect to the seasonality in the first part of the year versus the second part and how that perhaps might be offset by early stages of design with RAMs and general just organic growth?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yea, so, one of the things we saw in beginning of this year as you can - as you remember we had some customers pushing things up but also had some slower RAMs due to Chinese New Year coming back. So, we're taking some of that into account in, in looking at 2017.And, so we are expecting, clearly we're expecting for the year -- we're expecting growth and we'll talk more about that later but, I think we based on the kind of - we, we may take a little bit of seasonality into account on how we're going to guide and forecast going in the year, but clearly all the design wins that we mentioned in the past, specially our focus in the consumer high volume applications, we're seeing that those things are going into production.So, contributions from those as we saw this quarter and expected to see in Q4. We'll continue to see in the first half and definitely looks like from our portfolio and our profile second half will also see that in maybe even a stronger way.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, The Benchmark Company, LLC - Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, Ron, I don't think that you mentioned a cash flow number for the quarter. What was it for the quarter? What do you expect in terms of cash burn for Q4 and how much of your debt facility has been tapped? In other words, what's the borrowing capacity and what could the gross cash, you know go up to as a maximum?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corp. - CFO, Secretary [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yea, so those -- those are all good questions. So - so the - in, in July we, we refinanced debt that we had on the balance sheet at that point in time. So, we brought on incrementally about another $8.5 million of cash.So, if I proformatted that out from last quarter, we ended the quarter with $14.1 million and added about $8.5 million to $9.5 million in cash, so that would have taken it up to $23 million and we ended the quarter at $21.4 million, so that's how this quarter played out. And I think one of the things we're doing and, and I mentioned it in my comments is, is focusing on, you know some of the balance sheet metrics.So, you saw inventory come down, you saw our DSO come down to 45 days, so that certainly helpful in terms of operating cash flow. Going forward, the debt service going forward, just to give you a sense on - is about $1.9 million this quarter.So, we'll service the debt and then, we're going to manage the rest of the business, we're going to have a EBITDA loss or be EBITDA negative in Q4 but we think we can manage cash too. And when you take into account working capital and everything else to about $3 million at a decrease of $3 million and that includes the debt service.In terms of the facility itself, there are two components. One was a $18 million term loan and one was a $2 million revolving line of credit. At the end of September, they both had been tapped so all the way up to the $20 million, the $18 million starting to amortize, like I just mentioned at about $1.6 million a quarter.So, there's no additional borrowing capacity right now on those lines, nor do we think we need any. We think we will get to EBITDA to break even and we've communicated this in the past, sometimes, somewhere in the middle of next year. So at this point in time, we don't think we need any additional borrowing capacity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, The Benchmark Company, LLC - Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, all right, that's it for me. Thanks, guys.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is from [Robert Martin] of Needham & Company. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Participant Needham & Company - Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi and thank you for taking my question. I'm here on behalf of Rajvi Gill. You spoke earlier to the growing design win pipeline and that many of the design wins are coming from new customers. Is there particular segment that you're seeing particularly strong with these wins?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi Robert. Yea, like we mentioned - if you look at the -- you know maybe, the key thing would be if you focus on the dollar content of the design wins, because sometimes the number may be misleading but, if you look at the dollar content of the design win, the - for Q3 64% of the dollar content of the design wins came from consumer.And 15% came from industrial markets and 21% from the rest. But, if you look at the number, of the design wins, the actual number, 48% were industrial, 20% were consumer. So, you can see the strength, if you want to qualify the strength from having high volume opportunities. It's coming from the consumer side.And, in general, you know a rule of thumb for our products is that typically the industrial market would have more of the higher ASB. So, with that combination we can see that there's a lot of interest in, in, in - on the consumer side for our - for our products. So, I would say that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Participant Needham & Company - Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. Thanks, that's helpful and, and just one more question real quick. Could you speak towards your Smart Metering initiative a little bit more and what traction you're seeing there?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corp. - Co-Founder, CEO, President, Director [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, Smart Metering has been, historically a very strong revenue generator for us. I think we have products here that are preferred by the Smart Meter vendors, significantly, especially our data flash family.What we did - we decided to create a family of products for more kind of cost sensitive markets within the Smart Meter which, focusing in China. So, that family is our AT35 family which we introduced. And what we've done now is, basically gone into China and we're looking at - we're currently sampling various Smart Metering opportunities there.We do sell in that market today with our AT45 family, our data flash family but the AT35, we believe is at the price point, where we should be able to get a much larger number of sockets in that market. But, as I mentioned, the industrial market, especially Smart Meter markets are long time from sampling to design win to full production. So, we're basically going through that phase right now.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Participant Needham & Company - Analyst [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great, thanks, that's very helpful. That's all for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.

Narbeh, please go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Leanne. Welcome to everyone joining us today. As highlighted in our press release today, I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter.With the revenue at high end upper guidance, operating expenses below guidance where it was below guidance enabling us to be well on track to achieve our target at EBITDA breakeven and by middle of the year.Entering the second quarter, we are excited to see a strong backlog and bookings in our business driven by design wins that are ramping into production across our customer base.Read MoreAdditionally, we had another strong quarter of new design wins, in which we secured over 90 design wins totaling an annual revenue runway potential of $5 million. Of course, assuming design wins reaching full production and it's always subject to market conditions. This continued momentum of new opportunities should help to secure our expected growth in the second half of 2017 and into 2018.From an end market perspective, approximately 40% of the design wins were secured in the industrial market, while consumer markets represented approximately 20% of the wins.Notable design wins included a high volume smart lighting application as well as wins for communication modules in personal computing devices and a high-volume smart home application.I had also indicated previously that we started an initiative to focus on large tier 1 ODMs to secure high-volume revenue opportunities for our products. And I'm happy to indicate that in Q1 2017, we secured design wins with several such customers in computing and communication end markets.These customers are utilizing multiple Adesto products across different applications demonstrating the increasing content and the breath of opportunities we have across our client base.As a direct result of our focus on diversifying and expanding our customer base over two-thirds of the design wins in the first quarter with new customers.Another key initiative for us has been to further diversify our business beyond our stronghold in the industrial market into markets where the duration from design win to production shorter and represents higher volume opportunities.In the first quarter, we had success along these lines as well. Of the top 10 design wins secured in the first quarter ranked by annual dollar value, approximately half are in consumer market and the other half in computing.One of our biggest assets is our large and top tier customer base. We supply our customers in a variety of ways including direct, through distribution, fulfillment houses, and through contract manufacturers.Hence, as I indicated previously, it's not a trivial task to trace accurately design win conversion wins into production. The last several quarters, we have put forth efforts to identify cases where we can clearly track design wins through the channel and into mass production with the end customers. And I'd like to share this data with you.Looking at the design wins in 2016 that could be traced clearly in the channel and into production, we can say that approximately two-thirds of them have started to ramp into production. Some are early in their production and some have ramped as expected.As we progress through the year, additional design wins was also beginning ramping into production, layering onto this growing pipeline of revenue generating designs. This is encouraging as it validates our investment and focus on expanding our base to support our growth profile as evidenced by our expectations for the second quarter.In terms of our top 20 revenue customers in the first quarter, the revenue breakdown by end market consisted of 42% from industrial market, 39% from consumer market, and the remaining 19% is spread across communication, medical, automotive, and computing.Examples of applications that are currently in volume production at these customers includes: smart meters as our largest customer, universal remotes, personal tracking devices, streaming TV and media player, and many others.With that, let me take a few minutes to talk about some of our product families in more detail. In the first quarter, we taped out our 65nm version of our 32Mb DataFlash family.This is a follow up tape out at 65-nanometer, as we taped out at 64Mb DataFlash last year as we communicated to you. This is a cost reduction initiative for our DataFlash family.We will be sampling these products with our leading industrial customers for the rest of the year and into 2018. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make progress sampling our AT35 DataFlash products that are designed specifically for the Asia smart meter market.As I've mentioned previously, this is product family that offers limited feature set, alternative targeting China smart meter customers and is more suitable for the cost-conscious metering and industrial markets, such as the ones in China.We continue to monitor market demand for DataFlash to see the need for densities beyond 32 and 64Mb at advance notes and will roll out those efforts into our planning when appropriate. We have close working relationships with our metering and industrial customers and always align our development efforts with our partners' product roadmaps.Turning to our Fusion family, we continue to generate increasing revenue and interest for this product. As I mentioned last quarter, this product family had experienced a rapid ramping shipments becoming one of our fasted growing lines.As many of you know, our existing portfolio are Fusion Flash products range from 256Kb to 4Mb. In order to expand these offerings, we have focused our development efforts on additional densities starting with 8Mb, 16Mb, and 32Mb. which we expect to tape out in the fourth quarter. We expect to sample these additional densities in mid-2018.Looking at our EcoXip product family, we also continue to make solid progress on our development and sampling activities. Engineering samples of our 32Mb device have been provided to our early customers and partners.The broader rollup of this product will occur in the fourth quarter and in 2018. We have started design activity of 128Mb EcoXip and expect to tape out this product this quarter. The 64Mb version of the EcoXip will be taped out later this year.By mid-2018, we believe we should have 32Mb, 64Mb, and 128Mb versions of the EcoXip in various levels of silicon sampling and hopefully in production with some of our early partners. Our EcoXip products can be deployed in many types of IoT and embedded devices, including wearables, medical monitors, POS controllers, sensors, and beacons.Leading MCU and system-on-chip customers such as NXP/Qualcomm are among the early designing customers. Industry leaders believe that as Soc and MCUs move to 28nm and below, embedding non volatile memory functionality becomes extremely expensive.EcoXip offers an ideal solution for such cases where performance, cost, and power characteristics of an EcoXip device, as a System-in-Package becomes an attractive alternative to today's solutions.Last quarter, we also taped-out a version of our Mavriq family designed for the camera module per plan. This is 128Kb serial non-volatile memory device, that's ideally suited for this growing market.We believe this is a very large market opportunity for Adesto, and we'll be actively engaged with customers and contract manufacturers to assess their specific needs, while also furthering seeding the market.This opportunity becomes even more attractive as the density requirements increase in the coming years because the Mavriq platform-base devices are more cost effective than alternative EEProm which are used today. We continue to work toward securing design wins for this application and expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters.Lastly, in terms of Standard Serial Flash product family, we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various high-volume opportunities for notebooks and tablets as well as consumer end markets.During the first quarter, we secured notable design wins for high-volume smart lighting applications with a leading SoC company. This particular design win is ramping into production this year. We have also secured design wins in a wearables application with a global navigation and variable technology company.As many of you recall, we began increasing our investment activity around this product group in the third quarter of 2016, as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher unit volumes and faster ramping opportunities, to further diversify our customer base and revenue.Since that time, we have made notable progress with customers as well as expansion of our product offerings across densities. These products have helped drive additional revenue opportunities near term, as the result of the shorter design cycles, by also broadening our footprint with customers.As I mentioned last quarter, we anticipate revenue contribution from these products to approach approximately 15% exiting the year, which will represents a significant underlying growth rate for this time.In summary, we look to the second quarter, the combination of design wins ramping into production and continued traction with new products is driving our expectation for strong growth, with revenue projected to grow 25% year-over-year.Entering Q2, we have record bookings, and backlogs, and we are seeing this trend continue as we progress through the quarter. This sets the stage for continued momentum across our end markets and product families in the second half of this year.With that, I will now turn the call over to Ron to review the first quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our second quarter outlook. Ron?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corporation - CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Narbeh, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. Revenue in the first quarter, ended March 31, 2017, was 11.3 million, and that was at the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of approximately 11.1% from the 10.2 million in the first quarter of last year and it was down seasonally 8.3% from $12.3 million last quarter.Gross margin in the first quarter was 49.1% as compared to 49.1% in the first quarter of 2016 and 50.6% last quarter. Gross margins continue to remain at the high end of our long-term model and reflect the fact that the market continues to embrace the value added differentiated solutions we provide. The slight decline sequentially in gross margin was due to primary to product mix and the impacted of fixed costs on a lower revenue base.We continue to expect gross margins to remain near 50%, but, on a quarter to quarter basis, they may fluctuate approximately 100 to 200 basis points. Longer term gross margins will continue to be supported by new products with higher value added content, continued cost reduction initiatives, and migration to lower process notes. In addition, we continue to experience a favorable pricing and competitive environment and anticipated pricing pressure in 2017 will remain subdued.GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $8.1 million as compared to $6.3 million in the prior year quarter, and that quarter included a gain of $2 million from a settlement with the former foundry supplier.GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $7.8 million. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.0 million as compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $6.7 million in the prior quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP OPEX to remain relatively flat when compared to 2016.Now, looking at first quarter non-GAAP OPEX in more detail, R&D expenses were $3 million as compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $3 million in the prior quarter.We continue to focus our resources on several market opportunities that we believe can have a more near term revenue contribution and that's resulted in lower R&D expenditures.Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $2.2 million as compared to $2.2 million in the year ago period and $2.3 million last quarter. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $1.8 million as compared to $1.3 million in the year ago quarter and $1.3 million last quarter. Stock base comp in the first quarter was $824,000, amortization of intangible assets was $309,000, and depreciation in amortization was $304,000.Accounting for these items, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was a loss of $1.1 million, as compared to a loss of 1.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 and a loss of $111,000 last quarter.GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $2.8 million or $0.18 per share, as compared to a net loss of $1.5 million or $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $1.7 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.First quarter non-GAAP net loss was $1.6 million, so $0.10 per share, as compared to net loss of $2.4 million or $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $0.6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Share count used to compute the fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP net loss was 15.6 million shares.In terms of balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $17.5 million in cash. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.3 million, that's down from $5.2 million last quarter. Our inventory metrics have continued to improve over last year and this quarter exceeded our targeted turns of 4X. Accounts receivable was $6.1 million, that represents a DSO of approximately every 48 days.Now, with respect to guidance for the second quarter of 2017, we currently expect to achieve a record revenue level ranging between $12.8 million to $13.1 million.At the midpoint, this implies year over year revenue growth of 25%. Gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between 48% and 50%. GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $8.3 million and $8.5 million and non-GAAP operating expenses between $7.1 million and $7.3 million.Stock base comp in the second quarter will be approximately $900,000, amortization of intangible assets will be approximately $300,000, and depreciation and amortization will be approximately $400,000. Weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 15.8 million shares in the second quarter.So, before opening the call of questions, I'd like to summarize my comments and operating objectives. First, we continue to control operating expenses and demonstrate leverage in our operating model. Second, we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter by 25% over the prior year period and set a new quarterly record. Third, we are on track to achieve our target of EBITDA breakeven by the middle of the year. Fourth, we have direct access to additional working capital exceeded with our recently filed shelf offering, which has been declared effective by the SEC. And lastly, we remain focus on winning more designs and new customers in the months ahead.With that, we'll open the call to questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions).Our first question comes from Gary Mobley of Benchmark. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, Benchmark - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congrats on a strong quarter and a strong guide. A question about the pricing environment, I think it's been pretty well documented that some of your more commodity or competitors or comparables over in Taiwan had been raising prices and experiencing tight supply. And it's also my understanding that you guys have preterm and pricing schedules with customers. So, how has this overall pricing environment impacted you? Is it a situation where your ASPs are falling slower than expected or is it helping your design win traction as an alternative to these commodity memories since it might be more price comparable?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi, Gary. It's Narbeh. It's more -- the effect for us is more of the latter. So, as I mentioned previously, when we do engage with our customer on applications with specific solutions. The alternative for the customer is always to go the commodity route. And of course, we have to offer enough value with our solutions and ask a premium over the commodity that is just enough so the economics make sense for the customer.So, when prices are firming up on commodity devices with the types of more in securing design wins, which is good for us because as you know, this become more sticky design wins. The effect we're seeing today in terms of more immediate guides on where we ended up the quarter, like you said, is in part negotiating with the customers in the past and this recent price stability with the commodity supplier is not really affecting us that much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, Benchmark - Analyst [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. As it relates to the supply environment or tight supply environment or Flash, are you affected at all by perhaps some extremely utilization rates with some of your foundry partners?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's always a concern. Obviously, when you have supply tightening the market and you know, we've seen this before and we work very closely with our suppliers at various level and just to ensure that, you know, we can deliver to the customers. So, we are aware of it and just like any of the other memory suppliers are and we are on top of it. And right now, we're not seeing any major concerns from that part.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gary Mobley, Benchmark - Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my question, guys.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from Suji Desilva of ROTH Capital. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi, Narbeh, hi, Ron. Congratulations on the strong results and guidance here. So, as we look at 2017's growth, we would be expecting, do you think it comes more from the consumer side, more from the industrial side or is it fairly balanced out or is there seasonality there?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------You mean for the rest of the year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Correct.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I tell you, it's broad-based for us. I think we've seen -- you know, for example, we've seen some of our leading returning customers basically ramping into productions. Again, these are all the design wins that we piled up and we've been talking about on different conference calls and conferences, you know, they are beginning to ramp into production and you know, the industrial always has a longer lead time on consumer. So, I think that's the effects we're seeing. We don't see any particular market segment standing out either in a positive or a negative way.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then, the new products that are coming online to help you grow with EcoXip and others, are they on schedule to track to production versus where you expect it three months ago, are any coming in sooner or any perhaps getting put out a little bit? That color would be helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, everything is on schedule. You know, we are aware. You know, the products that we taped out in the first quarter and are sampling with the early customers, and I shed some color as what to expect for the rest of the year from new products tape-outs today in the call. So far, everything is on schedule.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then a quick question for Ron. Ron, the headcount kind of expectation the end of year versus now, are you expecting to grow that count much or is that something that's relatively in place now?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corporation - CFO [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------You know, for the most part in place, there might be one or two ads here or there but it's effectively in place.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Two last questions. One on the China meter market. Is that one that you think has a good kind of ramp opportunity in the second half because of the potential volumes there? Is that something that comes in slowly? Any thoughts there would be helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, I wouldn't -- I -- yes. I think it's like any industrial market, it will be a slow ramp. And if we have a key milestone outside what I just talked about, we will basically communicate that. But right now, we're just seeing an increased level of sampling activity for the various industrial markets, metering being just one of them in Asia.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then just one last clarification. Lighting, is that going to be an industrial category or a consumer category or a mix of both?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We put that in the consumer space.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital Partners - Analyst [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Once again, congratulations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corporation - CFO [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Suji.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Schafer, Oppenheimer - Analyst [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Thanks, guys. And I'll add my congratulation as well. Maybe a follow up first to an earlier question. Would you be able to compare the revenue contribution from Fusion Flash, you know you have CBRam today, and then maybe where you expect that kind of mix to look or what you expect it to look like exiting this year? Just to kind of give us an idea of the relative -- maybe what relative growth rates are.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corporation - CFO [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Hey, Rick. This is Ron. You know, today, and historically DataFlash has been about 80% of the revenue and I guess as we go through the year, you know, Narbeh talked about in his earlier comments that the standard Flash products may exit the year at 15 or around 15% of overall revenue. And Fusion will come up as we go through the year. So, I would expect DataFlash to probably come down closer to 80% and with the balance split between standard serial Flash and Fusion.This year, CBRam or -- and EcoXip aren't a material contributor to revenue and those will start to ramp sometime in 2018.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Schafer, Oppenheimer - Analyst [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Thanks. And then, speaking of CBRam, I mean, when we would look out toward earlier '18 or when you expect it to start ramping, where do you see initial traction being the strongest there, you know, if you're talking about and end market, like industrial or consumer PC elsewhere?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So, again, I would focus more on the product families, right. So, if I look the Mavriq, which is I think what you're referring to, the Mavriq family, our main focus especially with this new camera module specific product that we taped-out is the camera module market. Obviously, we've been getting qualified sampling with some contract manufacturers, as I mentioned in that area, just to seed the market. And right now, we are engaged with all the top tier camera module manufacturers, showcasing what we have today and also letting them know what's the new camera module specific product, which is about to -- we should have samples of that late in the year.So, once we have a design win, I would be able to shed more color on that but our focus is going to be there in terms of the camera module market in 2018.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Schafer, Oppenheimer - Analyst [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Got it. Thanks, guys. That's it for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham & Company. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rajvindra Gill, Needham & Company - Analyst [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and I echo the congratulations. So, a question on the EcoXip product. Can you talk a little bit about the -- you know, the ASP for the product and the density for the product, you know, relative to the Fusion family? I would assume it would have higher ASPs potentially, maybe if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. So, first, in terms of density, there is the first EcoXip product that we produced, we have samples again, either a 32Mb. And you're right, typically, the EcoXip products are targeting higher density applications. So -- and I mentioned, we are taping out the 128-megabyte version of the EcoXip this quarter. And really, the way we decide what to tape out when is really the engagement with lead high volume customers to understand timing of when they are releasing their SoCs of MCUs to intercept with that.In terms of ASPs, naturally, they are higher than the Fusion because, first of all, just with the memory. So, it's a bigger die, a discrete higher density, higher ASP. But also, more importantly, the business model of EcoXip is slightly different than the Fusion. The Fusion typically is sold as component package device. We some opportunities that we sell Fusion as a Known Good Die. But in the case of EcoXip, the equation is reverse. So, we'd be selling that more in terms of Known Good Dies as a system in package applications.And so, as such, the cost of the package and the -- you know, the final test is not a part of the product. So, average ASPs, I would say, you know, it's -- you're looking above $0.50, $0.60. Again, it depends on the customers and volumes and so forth. Whereas, Fusion family on the average ASPs, you're looking at, you know, less than -- you know, close to half or less than that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rajvindra Gill, Needham & Company - Analyst [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. That's helpful. And we talk a little bit about -- you know, on the Fusion Flash business. In the last quarter, you said that you had shipped about 20 million Fusion Flash units and you expect that to double in 2017. Are we still on track there and can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific demand drivers for the Fusion Flash product this year? Has the design mix been changing for you?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So, the main driver again is vastly operated connected devices like Bluetooth and so forth. In terms of being on track for the half year, the answer is yes. If I look at volume shipment quarter Q1 of '17 versus '16, we are up significantly over last year for this quarter. So, we are on track for -- to hit the numbers that we talked about in 2017.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rajvindra Gill, Needham & Company - Analyst [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And the last question for me, Ron, in terms of the balance sheet, how do we think about deleveraging? I think in the past you had said that you were -- you know, there's a goal to pay down the debt. How do we think about debt repayment and going forward? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ron Shelton, Adesto Technologies Corporation - CFO [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. So, the terms that's amotizing right now is amortizing about a million seven a quarter. So, you know, from -- we talked about getting EBITDA positive in the middle of this year you take that combined with, you know, growing revenues, growing profitability, you know, managing working capital well, we have enough capital today to service debt and run the business.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rajvindra Gill, Needham & Company - Analyst [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from Orin Hirschman of AIGH Investment Partners. Your line is open.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi. How are you?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi, Orin. How are you?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good. Okay. I'm good. I'll ask you two question for now. One is, you had mentioned in the passing of the NXP, what you are working on with NXP, with Qualcomm. Is that -- were you referring to reference designs or were you referring to actually the first early design wins? Sorry, I wasn't clear on that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, we talked about this. In fact, there was a press release on this as well, the joint press release with NXP. So, it's a design win for EcoXip product. And again, this one, because it's -- really the product is being sold two ways to the customer. In one case, it's going to be as a Known Good Die to be attached within the package with MCUs and the second case, it would be a part of reference designs. So, it's a combination of what you just mentioned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. But that first design was what you were -- design win was what you were referring to?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No. So, what -- in case of the EcoXip, the customer has to incorporate basically the interface to be able to take full advantage of the EcoXip inside their SOC or MCUs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, in the case of several customers, and actually being one of them, they have done that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In fact, we designed the part in collaboration with several competing customers like NXP.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And just going back to the camera modules, were you actually in - even if its very small volumes today or are you actually in the commercial module?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [50]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, we're not. So, what we did is we were able to showcase the benefits of the Mavriq platform with a large contract manufacturer in the camera module. And together, we went to bid on a camera module business of a large Chinese camera module maker. What happened is the camera module marker decided to go with a different contract manufacturer. So, we, Adesto, lost that opportunity. But what it ended up happening is we realized it's a huge opportunity and the Mavriq platform is ideally suited for this application today and where it's going two, three, four years down the road. So, we put a concerted effort to design solutions specific for that end market.And since then, this was about a year ago, we've been engaged with other contract manufacturers as well as module makers to kind of prepare them for this new product that we'll be releasing end of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And is the driver there the module maker or is the driver the actual end customer that makes what's in the handset?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For -- the first one is the module maker. Benefits is -- can't come to the module maker, the contract manufacturer or the end camera user because end of today, we're using the cost of embedding camera modules in gadgets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners - Analyst [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks very much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [54]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Narbeh for any closing remarks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto Technologies Corporation - President and CEO [55]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.
