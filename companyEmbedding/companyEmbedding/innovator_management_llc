Loading...

The ETF
The Innovator IBD® 50 Fund is a natural progression of what Investor's Business Daily (IBD) started 30 years ago when its Investing System began to take shape.
 


The IBD® 50 is the signature standard among Investor's Business Daily's investing tools. As a general rule, IBD® 50 companies are generating outstanding profit growth, big sales increases, wide profit margins and a high return on equity.
The fundamental and technical indicators that combine to drive the IBD® 50 are based on research IBD’s William J. O'Neil began in the 1960's and which continues today. Using data going back to the 1880s, the approach looks for factors which have occurred over and over in top-performing companies:

Current earnings increasing quarter-over-quarter
Annual earnings increasing year-over-year 
New product/service/management providing catalyst
Stock price moves supported with increasing volume
Leading stock in a leading industry
Institutional ownership by mutual funds increasing


The IBD® 50 shows no bias toward any industry and stocks selection is not subjective. Ongoing analysis is designed to retain true leaders and replace names when price/volume movement or withering fundamentals demands it. It is this ability to dispassionately refresh itself that is elemental to the targeting of long-term outperformance.
 


Founded by O'Neil in 1984, Investor's Business Daily (IBD) is a leading financial news and research organization.
Recognized for its cutting-edge market research, IBD is well regarded for both its national publication as well as its website, Investors.com. Today IBD products are used by leading money managers as well as 200,000 investors.

Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Short term performance is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns.

Shareholders may pay more than the net asset value per share (“NAV”) when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. The data presented represents past performance and cannot be used to predict future results.
The Fund may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. (Premium - The amount the Fund is trading above the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of the NAV. Discount - The amount the Fund is trading below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV).
Shares of the Fund trade based on market prices rather than the Fund's NAV.
Consequently, shares of the Fund may trade at a price greater than (premium) or less than (discount) the Fund's NAV. The above chart presents information for the period indicated about how often the most recent market closing price for shares of the Fund reflected a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV for each trading day and the amount of each such premium or discount, expressed as a percentage of that day's NAV.









References to the “IBD® 50” in this document refer to the 50 stocks included in the IBD® 50 Index.  The IBD® 50 is only the list of those 50 stocks.  In contrast, the IBD® 50 Index represents a hypothetical portfolio of these 50 names included on a price-weighted basis. (Higher priced stocks represent a higher percentage of the Index compared to lower-priced stocks.)  The Innovator IBD® 50 Fund will not invest in the IBD® 50 Index companies in the same proportion as reflected in the Index.  The Fund is actively managed, conviction-weighted and it is not an index fund.  As a result, its performance will deviate from the IBD® 50 Index.
Investing involves Risks. Principal loss is possible. Along with general market risks, an ETF that concentrates its investments in the securities of a particular industry, market, sector, or geographic area may be more volatile than a fund that invests in a broader range of industries. Additionally, the Innovator IBD® 50 Fund may invest in securities that have additional risks. Foreign companies can be more volatile, less liquid, and subject to the risk of currency fluctuations. This risk is greater for emerging markets. Small and mid-cap companies can have limited liquidity and greater volatility than large-cap companies. Also, ETFs face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. ETFs are bought and sold at market price and not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
The “IBD®” mark and logo have been licensed to the Adviser by Investors Business Daily, Inc. (“IBD”) for use in connection with the Fund under certain circumstances. The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed or sold by IBD. IBD makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Fund. Additionally, while the Fund will generally hold all of the companies included in the IBD® 50 Index it will not invest in these companies in the same proportion as reflected in the Index. Performance will deviate from the performance of the IBD® 50 Index, and the active management of the Fund may not produce the desired results. Investor’s Business Daily® and CAN SLIM® marks and associated logos are used with permission by IBD.

Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Statutory and Summary prospectus contains this and other important information.

Innovation and Product Management













Innovation is the name of the game as far as companies in the 21st century are concerned. To compete effectively in the marketplace of this decade, companies need to either innovate or perish. Hence, innovation is the latest buzzword among the corporates. The innovation cycle as applied to product management consists of three stages:

The Idea Generation
Idea Conversion, and
Idea Diffusion

For effective innovation to work in favour of the company these three stages have to be managed well and this is where the product manager comes into the picture. The product manager has to ensure that there is no breakages in the innovation value chain as represented by these three stages. Hence, the role of the product manager is to make sure that the entire chain is strong since any chain is as strong as its weakest link.
The linkages between the three stages of the innovation cycle are described here. First, the idea generation stage is the phase where the emphasis should be on generating ideas from various sources and from within the business units and from across the company and even from the customers and end users. The idea conversion stage is the phase where the lists of new ideas thus generated have to be screened for commercial viability and the kind of business that they bring to the company. The idea conversion stage is also the phase where the ideas generated have to be vetted for their technical feasibility and whether the company has the resources and the bandwidth to take the ideas to the next stage and from there the product development phase.
Finally, the idea diffusion stage is the phase where the ideas thus sourced have to be vetted and funded and approvals taken from the various internal stakeholders as well as external ones. The idea diffusion stage represents the end point of the idea stage and hence the product manager has to ensure that all these phases work together in one single unified link so as to minimize the friction between the various components in the chain.
Hence, this innovation value chain is to be managed by the product manager who has the responsibility in the overall sense of bringing the product to the incubation stage. Any company that is not able to manage the innovation value chain should consider setting up a product management team or hiring a product manager to manage this innovation value chain. The point here is the innovation value chain must be strengthened and a cohesive and coherent value proposition has to be evolved. For this, the product manager is required to take overall control of the product management function a subset of which is the task of managing the innovation value chain. In conclusion, the weaknesses in the innovation value chain must be eliminated by careful and thoughtful application of the management principles and this is where the product manager with his or her expertise in the process can help companies innovate better, faster and emerge stronger.

This integrated consideration of innovation management and product innovation within an interdisciplinary approach represents a unique characteristic of this book.
