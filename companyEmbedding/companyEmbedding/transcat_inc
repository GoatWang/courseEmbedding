About









Calibration Services
Transcat  prides itself on being a premier provider of calibration services where quality, consistency,  and accuracy are central to every calibration we do. Companies in industries  such as Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices and other FDA-regulated industries,  Energy, Utility, Chemical Processing, and other industrial manufacturing  sectors trust Transcat to deliver calibrations and service they need to keep  their measurements accurate, their measurement risk low and their processes running.
Quality: ISO/IEC accredited calibrations

One of  the Widest Scopes of ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation in the industries we serve.
Accredited  by NVLAP (View each location's lab code and scopes).
National  Measurement Institute (NMI) or intrinsic traceability for all our calibrations.
Transcat  Quality Management Systems exceed ISO/IEC 17025 requirements.

Consistent: Centrally controlled datasheets and processes and ISO/IEC 17025  accreditation

Centrally  controlled datasheets and processes across all our lab locations.
Largest  dedicated quality and technical research team in the industry.
All  Transcat Labs undergo multiple types of audits including NVLAP external audit  on a regular basis, internal technical and quality lab audits, and random  daily data-desktop audits.

Accurate: Calibration experts  in leadership and operations 

Calibration  leadership has decades of metrology experience.
Calibration  Team is regularly published, active on advisory board, professional organizations  and national metrology forums.
Over 130 technicians averaging 15       years experience.

By having in-house  metrology experts, Transcat makes sure to fully understand customers’ needs and  most times provides answers to questions customers didn’t even know to ask.  Knowing these details upfront, the calibration relationship is stronger and  runs more smoothly as time goes on. In addition, customers have access to  Transcat’s multiple lab network with locations across the United States and  Canada. Transcat customers can keep projects on schedule without capacity  restraints that single-location providers face. Finally, as a leading  distributor of test and measurement instruments, Transcat has the ability to  calibrate most of the products they sell. Customers can be confident the new  item is ready for use, right out of the box. This customer experience coupled  with Transcat’s quality, consistent, and accurate calibrations, gives companies  a partner they can trust throughout the years.
 Test and Measurement Instrument Repair Services
      Transcat  repair services, just like our calibration services, are quality, consistent  and accurate. With a simple five step process, Transcat is able to get repairs  done fast and accurately. Making sure to accurately determine repairs as simple  or complicated and give each the time necessary to accurately determine the  problem and fix it. Customers trust Transcat not only to repair the product but  to calibrate it after to ensure accurate measurements right out of the box!
Transcat  repairs are:

Done by expertly trained repair technicians, who are  often faster and less expensive than most suppliers.
Available for most brands and models of test and  measurement instruments helping customers avoid the costly and time-consuming  transfer of goods. 
Flat-rate pricing on the most popular instruments making  it easy for customers to budget and acquire repair services. 
Highly regarded in the industry demonstrated by both  Megger and Stahlwille naming Transcat Authorized Repair Centers. 

Test and Measurement Instruments
  Uniquely separating  Transcat from other calibration service providers is our relationship with over  500 of the best brands in test and measurement instrumentation and offer over  100,000 different instruments.

Transcat also offers production model engineering, and repair services. Each of our calibration labs is ISO-9001:2008 compliant and our scope of accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 is one of the broadest in the industry.

Critical analysis includes Out-Of-Tolerance (OOT) non-conformances, risk/measurement assurance, instrument suitability and various elements relating to how calibration impacts the manufacturing process.
Rental Services
Why rent? Renting test & measurement equipment can reduce cost and maintenance. It can be a quick and convenient way to get a functional, tested and calibrated (when appropriate) unit with regards for capital requirements, inventory controls, maintenance expenses, and, frequently, at a lower cost for the project than buying a unit
