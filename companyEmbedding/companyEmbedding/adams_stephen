Since the current recession began in December 2007, the American economy  has lost a staggering total of 6.5 million jobs. The unemployment rate is hovering  near 10% for the first time in over a quarter-century. And still, each month several  hundred-thousand more people are losing their jobs. It seems as if words like “hope”  and “opportunity” have gone the way of our economy.For many people,  the very idea of unemployment (not to mention the reality of it) is a life-changing  trauma at the top of their stress list, disrupting their lives and marriages, and  even attacking their sense of self-worth. For others, this unenviable circumstance  might well be a blessing in disguise—marking the start of a new career path  or even self-employment. It all depends on how it’s handled. Back to Work!  is a short, easy-to-read book that will help you cope with the emotional and spiritual  effects of job loss, from an author who has been there. Three times.In Back  to Work! Stephen Adams speaks from experience as he helps you get from wherever  you are now—to your next career. This little book is full of illustrations  from Stephen’s own life and the lives of other successful career remodelers.

Early life[edit]
Adams was born in 1937 and was raised in Minnesota. Adams received a bachelor's degree in 1959 from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.[2]:180 He received his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1962. Adams is the son of long-time newspaper journalist and CBS radio and television broadcaster Cedric Adams.
Professional career[edit]
As of the end of 2007, Adams served as chairman of the board of Affinity Group Inc., FreedomRoads and Affinity Bank (now known as Camping World/Goodsam, Inc.) and is also chairman and the controlling shareholder of Adams Outdoor Advertising. He has been chairman of Affinity Group Inc., since its acquisition in December 1988 and chairman of Adams Outdoor Advertising since its founding in 1983. He also serves as chairman of Adams Radio Group, based in Lakeville, Minnesota, and Adams Publishing Group, based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.
Adams began his career in banking and soft drink bottling. Since the 1970s, Adams has served as chairman of privately owned banking, bottling, publishing, outdoor advertising, television and radio companies in which he holds a controlling ownership interest. Adams currently owns Chateau Fonplagade in Bordeaux as well as other left bank wineries, and Adamus, Michel-Schlumberger, Roblar, and Adler Fels wineries in Northern California.
In 1982, he won a protracted fight to gain control of the Bank of Montana System.[3][4] In 1984, Adams failed in a bid to take control of publicly traded Union Planters.[5][6] Bank of Montana System was sold to Norwest Corporation in 1993.[7]
Adams Outdoor[edit]
Adams Outdoor was founded in 1983 with the acquisition of Central Outdoor Advertising, located in Michigan. Over the next five years, Adams pursued a rollup of billboard and other outdoor advertising assets into additional medium-sized markets, primarily through the acquisition of existing outdoor advertising businesses in selected midwest, southeast and mid-Atlantic states.[8] Today the company is privately held, however in its final year of reporting public financials, 2000, the company had approximately $80 million of revenue. Since 2000, the company has increased its market position from the 6th largest outdoor advertising company in the US to the 4th largest behind Clear Channel Communications, Lamar Advertising Company, and CBS Outdoor Americas. In January, 2015, Adams Outdoor partnered with Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, to purchase Fairway Outdoor, effectively doubling the Outdoor holdings of Adams.
Affinity Group Inc.[edit]
On December 23, 1988, the direct predecessor of Affinity Group Inc. (AGI), owned by Adams, acquired a company called American Bakeries Company for approximately $138 million .[9] Adams was a noted private equity investor in the 1980s completing rollups of billboard assets to form Adams Outdoor Advertising and he also owns or has owned various banking, bottling, publishing as well as television and radio companies.[10][11] At the time of the merger, the sole operating assets of American Bakeries Company were TL Enterprises, Inc. (Trailer Life magazine) and Camp Coast to Coast, Inc. These entities consisted of what is today the Good Sam Club, Coast to Coast, AGI’s subscription-based products and services business and AGI’s RV-related publications, with the exception of the Woodall’s titles.[12][13]
From 1990 through 1997 AGI made a number of significant acquisitions that expanded AGI’s scale and presence. In 1990, AGI acquired Golf Card International, Inc. for approximately $18 million. Subsequently, in May 1994, AGI acquired Woodall Publishing Company, L.P. and Woodall World of Travel, L.P. (collectively Woodall’s) for approximately $11.5 million.
In 1995, AGI acquired San Francisco Thrift and Loan (founded in 1982) and the company’s headquarters were relocated to Ventura, California. In 1997 the bank was renamed Affinity Bank and in 1999, AGI transferred ownership to Affinity Bank Holdings, Inc. a separate entity controlled by Adams[14]
In March 1997, as part of AGI’s $130.0 million offering of the holding company notes due 2007, AGI acquired Camping World, Inc. and Ehlert Publishing for approximately $123.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively.[15][16] AGI s now known as Camping World/GoodSam, the largest RV dealer network and camping retailer in the United States. NBC's "The Profit" features Camping World/Goodsam CEO Marcus Lemonis as its star. On October 7th, 2016, Camping World/GoodSam completed its initial public offering, as Camping World Holdings, Inc., and trades on the New York Stock Exchange as CWH.
Newspapers[edit]
In 2014, Adams Publishing Group acquired 34 publications from American Consolidated Media.[17] In July, 2014, Adams purchased numerous newspapers in southern Minnesota from Huckle Publishing, Inc. In August, 2014, Adams purchased Chronotype Publishing in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. In September 2014, Adams purchased the Athens (OH) News. In January, 2015, Adams Publishing Group purchased the Dundalk Eagle in Maryland.
In June 2015, Adams purchased Southern Maryland Newspapers and Comprint Military Publications from The Washington Post. In November 2015, Adams purchased the Post Company, which published the daily Idaho Post Register as well as weekly newspapers Shelley Pioneer, Challis Messenger, and Jefferson Star.[18]
In September 2016, Adams purchased ECM Publishers, Inc, a Minnesota-based publisher of 50 community newspapers, and Jones Media, a Tennessee-based publisher of 10 community newspapers.[19]
Political affiliations[edit]
Adams has been actively involved in fundraising for Republican Party candidates. He reportedly contributed over $1 million of billboard advertising (through his Adams Outdoor Advertising business) to support George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.[20]
Philanthropy[edit]
Adams currently serves on the board of visitors for the Yale School of Music. The Adams Family Foundation, founded by Adams and his wife, Denise, has made grants to a variety of educational institutions including Yale University, Stanford University,[21] Westmont College, the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts and The Blake School. Adams gave a $100 million gift to the Yale School of Music, the largest single contribution in the school's 108-year history to that point.[22] Adams funded the construction of the Adams Center for Musical Arts at Yale University, and was dedicated in a ceremony officiated by Yale president, Peter Salovey, on February 16th, 2017.
Awards[edit]
Adams was selected to receive the Arbuckle Award from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in 2006.[23][24] In 2009, Adams was the recipient of the Yale Medal, the highest award bestowed by the Yale Alumni Association.
Personal life[edit]
Adams is married to his 4th wife, the former Denise Rhea. He has four sons from his first marriage to the late Virginia Susan Ridgway: Stephen Marcus, Mark Charles, Kent Ridgway, and Scott Learned Adams. Ridgway was the granddaughter of John Ridgway, co-founder of IDS (now known as Ameriprise Financial). Ameriprise Financial is a Fortune 200 company with a market capitalization of $21 billion. The Ridgway family sold their interest in IDS to American Express in 1984 for $600 million. IDS/American Express subsequently was renamed American Express Financial Advisers, and subsequently was spun off by American Express as its own publicly traded company in 2005, and renamed Ameriprise Financial. The company's flagship corporate headquarters, the IDS Centre, the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, designed by Phillip Johnson and completed in 1974, is still the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, though it no longer houses Ameriprise's corporate headquarters. Adams resides in Roxbury, Connecticut, Healdsburg, California, Big Timber, Montana, and Saint Emilion (Bordeaux), France.

Early life[edit]
Adams was born in 1937 and was raised in Minnesota. Adams received a bachelor's degree in 1959 from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.[2]:180 He received his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1962. Adams is the son of long-time newspaper journalist and CBS radio and television broadcaster Cedric Adams.
Professional career[edit]
As of the end of 2007, Adams served as chairman of the board of Affinity Group Inc., FreedomRoads and Affinity Bank (now known as Camping World/Goodsam, Inc.) and is also chairman and the controlling shareholder of Adams Outdoor Advertising. He has been chairman of Affinity Group Inc., since its acquisition in December 1988 and chairman of Adams Outdoor Advertising since its founding in 1983. He also serves as chairman of Adams Radio Group, based in Lakeville, Minnesota, and Adams Publishing Group, based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.
Adams began his career in banking and soft drink bottling. Since the 1970s, Adams has served as chairman of privately owned banking, bottling, publishing, outdoor advertising, television and radio companies in which he holds a controlling ownership interest. Adams currently owns Chateau Fonplagade in Bordeaux as well as other left bank wineries, and Adamus, Michel-Schlumberger, Roblar, and Adler Fels wineries in Northern California.
In 1982, he won a protracted fight to gain control of the Bank of Montana System.[3][4] In 1984, Adams failed in a bid to take control of publicly traded Union Planters.[5][6] Bank of Montana System was sold to Norwest Corporation in 1993.[7]
Adams Outdoor[edit]
Adams Outdoor was founded in 1983 with the acquisition of Central Outdoor Advertising, located in Michigan. Over the next five years, Adams pursued a rollup of billboard and other outdoor advertising assets into additional medium-sized markets, primarily through the acquisition of existing outdoor advertising businesses in selected midwest, southeast and mid-Atlantic states.[8] Today the company is privately held, however in its final year of reporting public financials, 2000, the company had approximately $80 million of revenue. Since 2000, the company has increased its market position from the 6th largest outdoor advertising company in the US to the 4th largest behind Clear Channel Communications, Lamar Advertising Company, and CBS Outdoor Americas. In January, 2015, Adams Outdoor partnered with Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, to purchase Fairway Outdoor, effectively doubling the Outdoor holdings of Adams.
Affinity Group Inc.[edit]
On December 23, 1988, the direct predecessor of Affinity Group Inc. (AGI), owned by Adams, acquired a company called American Bakeries Company for approximately $138 million .[9] Adams was a noted private equity investor in the 1980s completing rollups of billboard assets to form Adams Outdoor Advertising and he also owns or has owned various banking, bottling, publishing as well as television and radio companies.[10][11] At the time of the merger, the sole operating assets of American Bakeries Company were TL Enterprises, Inc. (Trailer Life magazine) and Camp Coast to Coast, Inc. These entities consisted of what is today the Good Sam Club, Coast to Coast, AGI’s subscription-based products and services business and AGI’s RV-related publications, with the exception of the Woodall’s titles.[12][13]
From 1990 through 1997 AGI made a number of significant acquisitions that expanded AGI’s scale and presence. In 1990, AGI acquired Golf Card International, Inc. for approximately $18 million. Subsequently, in May 1994, AGI acquired Woodall Publishing Company, L.P. and Woodall World of Travel, L.P. (collectively Woodall’s) for approximately $11.5 million.
In 1995, AGI acquired San Francisco Thrift and Loan (founded in 1982) and the company’s headquarters were relocated to Ventura, California. In 1997 the bank was renamed Affinity Bank and in 1999, AGI transferred ownership to Affinity Bank Holdings, Inc. a separate entity controlled by Adams[14]
In March 1997, as part of AGI’s $130.0 million offering of the holding company notes due 2007, AGI acquired Camping World, Inc. and Ehlert Publishing for approximately $123.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively.[15][16] AGI s now known as Camping World/GoodSam, the largest RV dealer network and camping retailer in the United States. NBC's "The Profit" features Camping World/Goodsam CEO Marcus Lemonis as its star. On October 7th, 2016, Camping World/GoodSam completed its initial public offering, as Camping World Holdings, Inc., and trades on the New York Stock Exchange as CWH.
Newspapers[edit]
In 2014, Adams Publishing Group acquired 34 publications from American Consolidated Media.[17] In July, 2014, Adams purchased numerous newspapers in southern Minnesota from Huckle Publishing, Inc. In August, 2014, Adams purchased Chronotype Publishing in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. In September 2014, Adams purchased the Athens (OH) News. In January, 2015, Adams Publishing Group purchased the Dundalk Eagle in Maryland.
In June 2015, Adams purchased Southern Maryland Newspapers and Comprint Military Publications from The Washington Post. In November 2015, Adams purchased the Post Company, which published the daily Idaho Post Register as well as weekly newspapers Shelley Pioneer, Challis Messenger, and Jefferson Star.[18]
In September 2016, Adams purchased ECM Publishers, Inc, a Minnesota-based publisher of 50 community newspapers, and Jones Media, a Tennessee-based publisher of 10 community newspapers.[19]
Political affiliations[edit]
Adams has been actively involved in fundraising for Republican Party candidates. He reportedly contributed over $1 million of billboard advertising (through his Adams Outdoor Advertising business) to support George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.[20]
Philanthropy[edit]
Adams currently serves on the board of visitors for the Yale School of Music. The Adams Family Foundation, founded by Adams and his wife, Denise, has made grants to a variety of educational institutions including Yale University, Stanford University,[21] Westmont College, the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts and The Blake School. Adams gave a $100 million gift to the Yale School of Music, the largest single contribution in the school's 108-year history to that point.[22] Adams funded the construction of the Adams Center for Musical Arts at Yale University, and was dedicated in a ceremony officiated by Yale president, Peter Salovey, on February 16th, 2017.
Awards[edit]
Adams was selected to receive the Arbuckle Award from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in 2006.[23][24] In 2009, Adams was the recipient of the Yale Medal, the highest award bestowed by the Yale Alumni Association.
Personal life[edit]
Adams is married to his 4th wife, the former Denise Rhea. He has four sons from his first marriage to the late Virginia Susan Ridgway: Stephen Marcus, Mark Charles, Kent Ridgway, and Scott Learned Adams. Ridgway was the granddaughter of John Ridgway, co-founder of IDS (now known as Ameriprise Financial). Ameriprise Financial is a Fortune 200 company with a market capitalization of $21 billion. The Ridgway family sold their interest in IDS to American Express in 1984 for $600 million. IDS/American Express subsequently was renamed American Express Financial Advisers, and subsequently was spun off by American Express as its own publicly traded company in 2005, and renamed Ameriprise Financial. The company's flagship corporate headquarters, the IDS Centre, the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, designed by Phillip Johnson and completed in 1974, is still the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, though it no longer houses Ameriprise's corporate headquarters. Adams resides in Roxbury, Connecticut, Healdsburg, California, Big Timber, Montana, and Saint Emilion (Bordeaux), France.

Early life[edit]
Adams was born in 1937 and was raised in Minnesota. Adams received a bachelor's degree in 1959 from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.[2]:180 He received his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1962. Adams is the son of long-time newspaper journalist and CBS radio and television broadcaster Cedric Adams.
Professional career[edit]
As of the end of 2007, Adams served as chairman of the board of Affinity Group Inc., FreedomRoads and Affinity Bank (now known as Camping World/Goodsam, Inc.) and is also chairman and the controlling shareholder of Adams Outdoor Advertising. He has been chairman of Affinity Group Inc., since its acquisition in December 1988 and chairman of Adams Outdoor Advertising since its founding in 1983. He also serves as chairman of Adams Radio Group, based in Lakeville, Minnesota, and Adams Publishing Group, based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.
Adams began his career in banking and soft drink bottling. Since the 1970s, Adams has served as chairman of privately owned banking, bottling, publishing, outdoor advertising, television and radio companies in which he holds a controlling ownership interest. Adams currently owns Chateau Fonplagade in Bordeaux as well as other left bank wineries, and Adamus, Michel-Schlumberger, Roblar, and Adler Fels wineries in Northern California.
In 1982, he won a protracted fight to gain control of the Bank of Montana System.[3][4] In 1984, Adams failed in a bid to take control of publicly traded Union Planters.[5][6] Bank of Montana System was sold to Norwest Corporation in 1993.[7]
Adams Outdoor[edit]
Adams Outdoor was founded in 1983 with the acquisition of Central Outdoor Advertising, located in Michigan. Over the next five years, Adams pursued a rollup of billboard and other outdoor advertising assets into additional medium-sized markets, primarily through the acquisition of existing outdoor advertising businesses in selected midwest, southeast and mid-Atlantic states.[8] Today the company is privately held, however in its final year of reporting public financials, 2000, the company had approximately $80 million of revenue. Since 2000, the company has increased its market position from the 6th largest outdoor advertising company in the US to the 4th largest behind Clear Channel Communications, Lamar Advertising Company, and CBS Outdoor Americas. In January, 2015, Adams Outdoor partnered with Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, to purchase Fairway Outdoor, effectively doubling the Outdoor holdings of Adams.
Affinity Group Inc.[edit]
On December 23, 1988, the direct predecessor of Affinity Group Inc. (AGI), owned by Adams, acquired a company called American Bakeries Company for approximately $138 million .[9] Adams was a noted private equity investor in the 1980s completing rollups of billboard assets to form Adams Outdoor Advertising and he also owns or has owned various banking, bottling, publishing as well as television and radio companies.[10][11] At the time of the merger, the sole operating assets of American Bakeries Company were TL Enterprises, Inc. (Trailer Life magazine) and Camp Coast to Coast, Inc. These entities consisted of what is today the Good Sam Club, Coast to Coast, AGI’s subscription-based products and services business and AGI’s RV-related publications, with the exception of the Woodall’s titles.[12][13]
From 1990 through 1997 AGI made a number of significant acquisitions that expanded AGI’s scale and presence. In 1990, AGI acquired Golf Card International, Inc. for approximately $18 million. Subsequently, in May 1994, AGI acquired Woodall Publishing Company, L.P. and Woodall World of Travel, L.P. (collectively Woodall’s) for approximately $11.5 million.
In 1995, AGI acquired San Francisco Thrift and Loan (founded in 1982) and the company’s headquarters were relocated to Ventura, California. In 1997 the bank was renamed Affinity Bank and in 1999, AGI transferred ownership to Affinity Bank Holdings, Inc. a separate entity controlled by Adams[14]
In March 1997, as part of AGI’s $130.0 million offering of the holding company notes due 2007, AGI acquired Camping World, Inc. and Ehlert Publishing for approximately $123.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively.[15][16] AGI s now known as Camping World/GoodSam, the largest RV dealer network and camping retailer in the United States. NBC's "The Profit" features Camping World/Goodsam CEO Marcus Lemonis as its star. On October 7th, 2016, Camping World/GoodSam completed its initial public offering, as Camping World Holdings, Inc., and trades on the New York Stock Exchange as CWH.
Newspapers[edit]
In 2014, Adams Publishing Group acquired 34 publications from American Consolidated Media.[17] In July, 2014, Adams purchased numerous newspapers in southern Minnesota from Huckle Publishing, Inc. In August, 2014, Adams purchased Chronotype Publishing in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. In September 2014, Adams purchased the Athens (OH) News. In January, 2015, Adams Publishing Group purchased the Dundalk Eagle in Maryland.
In June 2015, Adams purchased Southern Maryland Newspapers and Comprint Military Publications from The Washington Post. In November 2015, Adams purchased the Post Company, which published the daily Idaho Post Register as well as weekly newspapers Shelley Pioneer, Challis Messenger, and Jefferson Star.[18]
In September 2016, Adams purchased ECM Publishers, Inc, a Minnesota-based publisher of 50 community newspapers, and Jones Media, a Tennessee-based publisher of 10 community newspapers.[19]
Political affiliations[edit]
Adams has been actively involved in fundraising for Republican Party candidates. He reportedly contributed over $1 million of billboard advertising (through his Adams Outdoor Advertising business) to support George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.[20]
Philanthropy[edit]
Adams currently serves on the board of visitors for the Yale School of Music. The Adams Family Foundation, founded by Adams and his wife, Denise, has made grants to a variety of educational institutions including Yale University, Stanford University,[21] Westmont College, the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts and The Blake School. Adams gave a $100 million gift to the Yale School of Music, the largest single contribution in the school's 108-year history to that point.[22] Adams funded the construction of the Adams Center for Musical Arts at Yale University, and was dedicated in a ceremony officiated by Yale president, Peter Salovey, on February 16th, 2017.
Awards[edit]
Adams was selected to receive the Arbuckle Award from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in 2006.[23][24] In 2009, Adams was the recipient of the Yale Medal, the highest award bestowed by the Yale Alumni Association.
Personal life[edit]
Adams is married to his 4th wife, the former Denise Rhea. He has four sons from his first marriage to the late Virginia Susan Ridgway: Stephen Marcus, Mark Charles, Kent Ridgway, and Scott Learned Adams. Ridgway was the granddaughter of John Ridgway, co-founder of IDS (now known as Ameriprise Financial). Ameriprise Financial is a Fortune 200 company with a market capitalization of $21 billion. The Ridgway family sold their interest in IDS to American Express in 1984 for $600 million. IDS/American Express subsequently was renamed American Express Financial Advisers, and subsequently was spun off by American Express as its own publicly traded company in 2005, and renamed Ameriprise Financial. The company's flagship corporate headquarters, the IDS Centre, the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, designed by Phillip Johnson and completed in 1974, is still the tallest building in Minneapolis, MN, though it no longer houses Ameriprise's corporate headquarters. Adams resides in Roxbury, Connecticut, Healdsburg, California, Big Timber, Montana, and Saint Emilion (Bordeaux), France.

For many people, the very idea of unemployment (not to mention the reality of it) is a life-changing trauma at the top of their stress list, disrupting their lives and marriages, and even attacking their sense of self-worth. In Back to Work!




Description


Since the current recession began in December 2007, the American economy  has lost a staggering total of 6.5 million jobs. The unemployment rate is hovering  near 10% for the first time in over a quarter-century. And still, each month, several  hundred-thousand more people are losing their jobs. It seems as if words like “hope”  and “opportunity” have gone the way of our economy.For many people,  the very idea of unemployment (not to mention the reality of it) is a life-changing  trauma at the top of their stress list, disrupting their lives and marriages, and  even attacking their sense of self-worth. For others, this unenviable circumstance  might well be a blessing in disguise—marking the start of a new career path  or even self-employment. It all depends on how it’s handled. Back to Work!  is a short, easy-to-read book that will help you cope with the emotional and spiritual  effects of job loss, from an author who has been there. Three times.In Back  to Work! Stephen Adams speaks from experience as he helps you get from wherever  you are now—to your next career. This little book is full of illustrations  from Stephen’s own life and the lives of other successful career remodelers.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREPoetic Designs: An Introduction To Meters, Verse Forms, And Figures Of Speechby Adams, StephenThere are numerous introductions to poetry and prosody available, but none at once so comprehensive and so accessible as this. With the increasing emphasis on free verse, the past generation has developed a widespread impression that the study of poetic meter is old fashioned or even that form 'doesn't matter' in poetry. It is an impression that has not been dispelled by the emphasis of some of the existing texts in the area on forms that are now rare or outmoded. The irony is that simultaneously in the past decade interest in formal matters among many poets and literary scholars has been on the increase; the reality is that prosody is today on the cutting edge of literary studies.Stephen Adams' text provides a full treatment of traditional topics, from the iambic pentameter through other accentual-syllabic rhythms (trochaic, dactylic and so on) and covering as well other metrical types, stanza structure, the sonnet and other standard forms. Adams also includes a variety of topics not covered in most other introductions to the topic; perhaps most significantly, he provides a full chapter on form in free verse. Moreover, he treats rhyme extensively and includes a comprehensive chapter on on literary figures. Poetic Designs is thus much more that an introduction to prosody; it is a concise but comprehensive introduction to the nature of poetry in English. It is a book for the general reader and the aspiring writer as well as for the student, a book intended (in the words of the author) to help 'heighten the experience of poetry.'Rhetoric, PoetryCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Van Damme action thumper about a former addict cop whose life is changed after a near death and coma experience. Anthony Stowe (Jean Claude Van Damme) is a dirty narcotics lieutenant who takes a little dab of the 'H' himself from time to time. His life begins to unravel when his wife announces she's pregnant and he's not the daddy. As if things aren't bad enough for the man, the bottom of his world falls even further when he's almost killed in a bust gone awry and he ends up in a coma. He miraculously pulls out of this stall and fights hard to regain his feet only to find that his pregnant wife has been kidnapped and is being held by a local gang led by his former partner-gone bad Gabriel Callaghan (Stephen Rea). Stowe has an epiphany of repentance and vows to go straight, for his wife, his job and for the downfall of Callaghan.

Obviously not content with simply cranking out one mindless actioner after another to clutter our shelves, Van Damme once again trys something a little different within his chosen genre - and as a big fan of the belgian bruiser, its great to see him once again not only flexing his pecs, but also his acting muscles.Directed by Simon Fellows (who shot the Wesley Snipes actioner "7 Seconds" and the disappointing JC vehicle "Second in Command"), "Until Death" is a dark and nightmarish thriller which follows detective Anthony Stowe (Van Damme) who is universally despised by both his work collegues and to a lesser extent, his wife. Addicted to heroin and spiralling into his own personal hell, Stowe has just come off a drug bust that has gone horribly wrong resulting in the death of two of his comrades and now finds himself in a coma when gunned down by arch nemesis Gabriel Callaghan (played in somewhat hammy fashion by the usually reliable Steven Rea). What follows is a tale of redemption as JC comes back from the brink of death - and given a second chance, he attempts to make everything right with his life - including his job and his recently pregnant wife who has been kidnapped by Callaghan in an attempt to draw out Stowe. There is more to the story, but that is the basic premise in a nutshell - but, what pulls it out of the usual direct to video dreck is the assured central performance from Van Damme.Taking a cue from his last Ringo Lam collaboration, the excellent "In Hell", Van Damme once again attempts a complex and non-too likeable character who finds redemption through the combination of violence, honour and love. To see JC perform these kind of roles is wholly satisfying - he is proving on a smaller scale that he isn't just the guy who does the splits and another low rent video Seagal clone, he's a strong movie star who can offer a range of emotions and ultimately create a fully rounded character for an audience to connect with and follow through the movie.The rest of the cast are hit and miss. Stephen Rea is miscast in a larger than life bad guy role, and he seems to be just reading his lines and hitting his cues. JC's wife Valerie (Selina Giles) isn't that stong either and someone deeper is needed to pull the role off - however, this is really Van Dammes' show all the way. It was weird watching it, because the first 45 minutes of the movie, JC is quite despicable and you finding yourself not really liking him - and its not until the last half hour do we see the Van Damme that we know from movies of old. Its a testament to his talent, that he can produce a fully rounded dislikable character at this time of his career - I just hope that their are a number of bigger budgeted producers out there watching what he is doing on the small screen, because I would rather see him in a medium budgeted actioner than the new wave of dull TV extra lite "stars" that we are getting today. Its quite a shame that this went direct to video, because it is far more involving than most movies I have to sit through in theatres. With a slightly higher budget and a stronger supporting cast, Until Death could have been a contnder. JC really has paid his dues now. Its time he came back in a bigger movie.All in all, if you are a Van Damme fan then this movie is a given and one of his best movies in a long time. If you aren't a fan, then this still ranks as a high end DVD release, and well worth a peak.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsA pretty Van Damme good movieByDaniel JolleyHALL OF FAMETOP 500 REVIEWERon 8 August 2007Format: DVDI haven't seen all that many Van Damme movies, but the ones I have seen have all been pretty good (I'm one of the few people that actually liked Second in Command).  I had my doubts early on this time around, though, as Van Damme looked like death warmed over, and his character was pretty hard to sympathize with, even for an anti-hero.  But you know what?  Van Damme himself may be showing some age now, but he is far from washed up.  I see Until Death as a transition film of sorts for him; he shows that he can still be a tough guy without relying on elaborate martial arts displays and, more importantly, that he has developed into a decent actor.  Anthony Stowe isn't your stereotypical, one-dimensional cop; there's a lot going on with this guy, and Van Damme does a really nice job of revealing both the bad and the good in the character.Stowe is a NARC on the New Orleans police force, and he's carrying two huge monkeys on his back: a seemingly personal mission to bring down the city's most notorious gangster and a secret addiction to heroin.  Obviously, he does not fit the description of a good cop.  Watching fellow cops die as a result of his continually futile efforts to catch Callahan (Stephen Rea) doesn't do much for his already abrasive attitude, he has no qualms about roughing up potential criminals, innocents, or fellow cops, he doesn't work well (if at all) with a partner, and the heroin isn't helping his job performance.  His personal life is in even more of a shambles, as he has just learned that the wife he has been neglecting is pregnant - with someone else's child.  Yep, you'd think life couldn't get much worse than it already is for old Anthony - until the guy he's hunting finds him and leaves him lying in an alley with a bullet in his skull.Miraculously, Stowe survives the shooting, but it is several months before he emerges from a coma.  As his physical rehabilitation progresses, he starts taking steps to rehabilitate his life as well, apologizing and making amends to those he has hurt along the way.  Unfortunately, though, the people he cares about the most remain in harm's way as long as Callahan is still out there - and he's really out there, having wiped out any and all criminal competitors and solidified his position as king of the criminal dung heap during Stowe's absence.  You know an ultimate showdown between Stowe and Callahan is coming, and the movie does not disappoint, serving up an exciting, action-packed ending.Van Damme isn't going to win any best actor awards, but he actually does quite a commendable job bringing out the nuances of his character, as Stowe tries to put his life back together again following his grievous injury.  Until Death isn't focused entirely on action and more action; there's a really human element here that I wasn't expecting to find.  If this film is any indication, Van Damme isn't going to disappear from the cinematic radar any time soon.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSolid, memorable movie. Van Damme still delivers.ByMs. Kimberley L. Sturton 21 May 2007Format: DVDAlthough Van Damme is an 'old-school' action star most popular for his martial arts and quick fun action films, he still delivers great character acting and action scenes 20 years on from from his popular 80s early 90s features. Until Death is now in my top 3 Van Damme favorites. Unlike Steven Seagal, Jean Claude has aged with grace and diginity, taking his roles seriously and puts out some dynamic character acting that gives this film good weight and a suspense unlike that of his more popular movies. This is far more then just an action screen favorite doing a low-budget 'dated' + 'easy money' flick for the fans. Until Death holds it's own and differs greatly in style and suspense from personal fav's such as A.W.O.L. and Double Impact. It's more brutal, and bleak then cheesy and '80s' cool.Van Damme plays a beat-down heroin addicted cop, who's having a string of bad events in and out of work, resulting in a real mess of man who has to pick himself out of a partly self-made gutter. The synopsis could read like that of an action movie 20years old but the execution is modern and fresh, with Van Damme giving a strong performance mixed with ballsy and dramactic action scenes. I feel, long term fans and general action/drama viwers will certainly get their moneys worth in checking out this film.Read more0Comment|

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -The former Chief Financial Officer for Birmingham-based Adams Produce, which closed and filed for bankruptcy in 2012, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of withholding information about a scheme to defraud the federal government of $481,000 on a fruits and vegetables contract.
John Stephen Alexander, who was CFO for Adams Produce from 2007 until the company closed in April 2012, pleaded guilty during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Hopkins.
Alexander had been charged in a May 2 indictment with one count of conspiracy and 32 counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud. But in a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Alexander pleaded guilty to one count of misprision - withholding information on a crime.
In exchange for his plea and cooperation with prosecutors, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to drop the charges in the indictment.
"The plea agreement and today's guilty plea evidence Mr. Alexander's acceptance of his responsibility in the sequence of events at Adams Produce Company," Alexander's attorney, Augusta Dowd, stated in a prepared release.
"Mr. Alexander has been fully cooperative with the government's investigation into the wrongdoing at Adams Produce," Dowd stated.
Alexander provided assistance to both the internal investigation and to the government and was one of the first Adams Produce officers to voluntarily meet with the U.S. Attorney's office.
Assistant U.S. Attorney George Martin declined to comment after Wednesday's hearing.
Attorneys for former COO Steven Craig Finberg, who also was indicted earlier this year also were monitoring Wednesday's hearing. The attorneys said that Finberg maintains he is innocent of the charges.
Five other former Adams Produce officials have pleaded guilty to charges and have been sentenced to prison or probation in the investigation in the past year. Four of the men were also ordered by judges to jointly pay $481,000 restitution to the government. Alexander, under his plea agreement, also will be jointly responsible for paying the restitution.
The more than century-old company was counted among Birmingham's oldest and largest. It had expanded to four states by the time the Adams family sold it to groups of investors in 2010. Within two years the company had filed for bankruptcy, had laid off more than 400 employees, and its top executives had come under federal investigation related to an alleged government fraud scheme.
According to the plea agreements the scheme went like this:
Adams Produce had contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency for the Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia to provide fruits and vegetables for use at military bases and schools. The federal government would pay a certain price above what it would cost Adams Produce to get the produce from its suppliers. Adams Produce was required to submit proof of its costs.
According to the indictment and other court documents, certain Adams Produce officers and employees between August 2011 and November 2011 arranged transactions with the Georgia location of T.L.C. (Tom Lange Company), a major nationwide wholesale produce company, to create fraudulent purchase orders reflecting a higher cost to Adams Produce of purchasing fruits and vegetables.
Adams officials then submitted the fraudulent purchase orders to the Defense Logistics Agency as proof of what the produce cost.
On Oct. 26, 2011 Alexander instructed Kirkland and O'Brien - general manager for the Adams Produce distribution center in Pensacola, Fla. - "to gradually end the scheme to defraud - telling them to bring it in for a soft landing - rather than ending it immediately so as to avoid raising red flags and better avoid detection by DLA," according to the indictment.
After the company filed bankruptcy, a lawsuit was filed by Adams Produce shareholders against the accounting firm of Frost Cummings Tidwell Group, which had audited the books of Adams Produce. The suit claims the audit made the company seem healthier that it was, inducing the investment firm to buy a majority stake in the company for $20 million.
A trial in the lawsuit was to begun Sept. 29, but two weeks before it was to have begun attorneys notified U.S. District Judge Madeline Haikala that they had reached a settlement in the case. The judge gave both side until Nov. 14 to file a joint stipulation of dismissal or a joint report updating the court on the status of their settlement.
Note: Alexander's attorney notified the judge at Wednesday's hearing that his middle name is "Stephen." Court documents had misspelled it, she said.

Description












                                            Well, really, what is there to say about Douglas Adams that we haven't said before and you don't already know? Still, if you've ever giggled over one of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, and most especially if you've delighted in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency or The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, or both, you really ought to have this book as well. Compiled from the bits recorded in the hard drives of Adams's various Macintosh computers, this lovingly assembled posthumous miscellany uncovers his sublime and comic musings on everything from his school trousers to malt whisky, from the letter Y (Why?) to the enormity of his own nose, via watchmakers, hangovers, and fried eggs. It boasts an editor's note, a prologue, and a foreword, and includes the very short third Dirk Gently novel of the title, comprising 11 hugely brief chapters pulled together from three separate drafts, all headed in more or less the same direction. "There are those who write from time to time and do it well, and then there are Writers," Stephen Fry intones in his foreword. "Douglas Adams, and it is pointless to attempt here an explanation or anatomisation, was born, grew up, and remained a Writer to his too-early dying day.... You are on the verge of entering the wise, provoking, benevolent, hilarious, and addictive world of Douglas Adams. Don't bolt it all whole�as with Douglas's beloved Japanese food, what seems light and easy to assimilate is subtler and more nutritious by far than it might at first appear. The bottom drawer of recently deceased writers is often best left firmly locked and bolted. In the case of Douglas, I am sure you will agree, the bottom drawer (or in his case, the nested subfolders of his hard drive) has been triumphantly well worth the prising open."
