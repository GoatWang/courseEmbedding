Peabody Energy Corp. has extended the employment contract of its chairman and chief executive officer.
Gregory H. Boyce, scheduled to step down as chairman and CEO at the end of 2014, will remain with the St. Louis-based company an additional year as executive chairman — or at least until a successor is named, according to a company filing on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
His compensation for 2014 will be unchanged regardless of whether his successor as CEO is appointed before the end of the year, according to the transition agreement between the company and Boyce, dated April 29.

For 2015, Boyce’s base salary will be cut to $900,000 from the current rate of $1,225,660 a year.
His target bonus opportunity also is reduced, to 100 percent in 2015 of base salary from the current 120 percent. And his maximum bonus opportunity gets cut to 200 percent of base salary from the current 240 percent. Boyce also is eligible for three grants of restricted stock units, each valued at $1 million.

If Boyce is terminated without cause during 2015, he’s entitled to a prorated bonus, according to the transition agreement. The appointment of a new chairman and CEO or a decision to move the company headquarters more than 50 miles from either St. Louis or Phoenix both would be deemed a termination without cause, the filing states.

Base salary represents a small portion of total compensation for CEOs of public companies. In 2012, Boyce’s total compensation was $9,491,405, including bonus and incentive pay and stock options. That made him the sixth-highest-paid CEO of a St. Louis area-based public company last year, according to an analysis of executive compensation by the Post-Dispatch.
Boyce, 58, a Peabody director since March 2005, was named CEO in January 2006 and elected chairman of the board in October 2007.
He has extensive background in energy and mining issues, and serves on the Coal Industry Advisory Board of the International Energy Agency, National Coal Council, National Mining Association, and other organizations.

HANDOUT

Peabody Energy Corp. has extended the employment contract of its chairman and chief executive officer.
Gregory H. Boyce, scheduled to step down as chairman and CEO at the end of 2014, will remain with the St. Louis-based company an additional year as executive chairman — or at least until a successor is named, according to a company filing on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
His compensation for 2014 will be unchanged regardless of whether his successor as CEO is appointed before the end of the year, according to the transition agreement between the company and Boyce, dated April 29.

For 2015, Boyce’s base salary will be cut to $900,000 from the current rate of $1,225,660 a year.
His target bonus opportunity also is reduced, to 100 percent in 2015 of base salary from the current 120 percent. And his maximum bonus opportunity gets cut to 200 percent of base salary from the current 240 percent. Boyce also is eligible for three grants of restricted stock units, each valued at $1 million.

If Boyce is terminated without cause during 2015, he’s entitled to a prorated bonus, according to the transition agreement. The appointment of a new chairman and CEO or a decision to move the company headquarters more than 50 miles from either St. Louis or Phoenix both would be deemed a termination without cause, the filing states.

Base salary represents a small portion of total compensation for CEOs of public companies. In 2012, Boyce’s total compensation was $9,491,405, including bonus and incentive pay and stock options. That made him the sixth-highest-paid CEO of a St. Louis area-based public company last year, according to an analysis of executive compensation by the Post-Dispatch.
Boyce, 58, a Peabody director since March 2005, was named CEO in January 2006 and elected chairman of the board in October 2007.
He has extensive background in energy and mining issues, and serves on the Coal Industry Advisory Board of the International Energy Agency, National Coal Council, National Mining Association, and other organizations.
