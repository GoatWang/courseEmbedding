This led to an extensive education in engineering, but after completing a Masters degree and beginning a career in consulting, I realized it wasn't for me.  Growth and success in that business eventually led to management or sales.  I do not enjoy being a salesman.  There are very few jobs where the creativity and manual labor are part of your daily routine.  With all my science background, surgery seemed like a natural fit.  I never grew up thinking I would be a plastic surgeon, but one of the early reconstructive surgery I saw in medical school convinced me otherwise.  I witnessed a patient that had a cancer of his gum line that required half of his jaw to be removed.  We reconstructed the defect with one of the lower leg bones (fibula) that was moved as a free-tissue transfer, requiring microvascular connections of the artery and vein to provide the transferred tissue with a blood supply.  I was hooked.  This led to in-depth training at the prestigious Emory University in Atlanta.

It has been two years since my surgery, and I have never regretted it. I had an umbilical and ventral hernia after a pregnancy in which I had a very large baby. They were very painful and needed surgery. Dr Schaefer was very professional and did amazing work! My scar healed beautifully. I recommend Dr Schaefer to anyone that mentions to me they are considering a tummy tuck! I would also recommend him for botox!55Minneapolis, MN | Feb 13, 2017Dr. Schaefer came highly recommended to me and now I will pass along the recommendation to others. Dr. Schaefer is known as a perfectionist and I truly appreciate that. Our visits were short, sometimes strikingly short, but he always answered my questions and his staff was always available for questions too. I'm very happy with the results of all his work.55-Christina S in Minneapolis, MN | Jan 29, 2017I have worked with Dr. Schaefer for the last 4 years after having a double mastectomy. He is an artist who strives for perfection in his work. He was compassionate and attentive. I always felt that I had a say in procedures and options for my reconstructive surgery. He was a perfectionist and made suggestions for fixing problems that bothered me. No request was denied or ignored. He exhibits that rare combination of quality and compassion, sometimes lacking in other physicians today. 55-Tammy in Rosemount, MN | Jan 22, 2017Dr. Schaefer met with me before my bilateral mastectomy and explained the plastic surgery options. He is professional and a gifted surgeon. I have seen him off and on since 2009, and I highly recommend him for anyone going through breast cancer. I am pleased with my reconstructed breasts. 55-R Hester in Bloomington, MN | Nov 01, 2016Dr. Schaefer is Professional, Ethical
And caring. Surgery can be stressful
But necessary. I was informed of
Step by step procedures pre/ post
Operative. I would highly recommend
Dr. Schaefer.
55-Elle in Minneapolis, Minnesota | Mar 24, 2016He was wonderful. Will listen to you. Did a great job! Went from DDDD to small C or larger B cup. I asked him to make them as small as possible. We discussed this at some length and he did. I love the reduction. Now I am running- something inconceivable to me before.

Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Jessie Timothy A MD502 Van Buren StFostoria, OH 44830(419) 436-6767Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. McMullen, Timothy, MD6488 E Main St Ste CReynoldsburg, OH 43068(614) 552-2300Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Conlan, Tim K, MD2600 Tuscarawas St W Ste 300Canton, OH 44708(330) 455-5367Physicians & Surgeons, OrthopedicsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Timothy Barnett MD20455 Lorain RdCleveland, OH 44126(440) 673-0100Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Peters, Timothy F, MD9000 N Main StEnglewood, OH 45415(937) 836-3118Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Timothy N Wourms MD1010 Summitt DrMiddletown, OH 45042(513) 424-0122Physicians & Surgeons, Family Medicine...Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Moore, Timothy D, MD3100 Plaza Properties BlvdColumbus, OH 43219(614) 383-6000Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Myer, Timothy J, MD437 Portage TrlCuyahoga Falls, OH 44221(330) 929-9136Physicians & SurgeonsSurgery CentersWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Moore Timothy MD5885 Landerbrook DrCleveland, OH 44124(440) 285-6975Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Gallagher, Timothy, MD6707 Powers Blvd Ste 201Cleveland, OH 44129(440) 743-2050Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Drankwalter Timothy MD4070 Gantz RdGrove City, OH 43123(614) 801-0331Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Sidor Tim A MD(1)6900 Pearl Rd Ste 200Cleveland, OH 44130(440) 845-0900Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesThe best doctor in Cleveland.
