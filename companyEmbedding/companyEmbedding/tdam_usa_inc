In addition to the normal risk associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principals or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Income-producing stocks that meet the Fund's investment criteria may not be widely available and/or may be concentrated in one or a few regions or sectors, which may impact the Fund's ability to produce current income while remaining diversified.  Bond and bond funds are subject to intrest rate risk and will decline in value as intrest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments.

What are analysts saying about AXT stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about AXT stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "AXT, Inc., designs, develops, manufactures and distributes high-performance compound semiconductor substrates, as well as opto-electronic semiconductor devices such as high-brightness light emitting devices, and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.   " (6/27/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Before market open, AXTI announced that a fire at its Beijing manufacturing facility on the evening of March 15 has halted wafer production, impacting revenue for the current quarter. Luckily no one was injured but AXTI reduced 1Q17 revenue guidance by $1.5-2.0 million as a result. Clearly, this operational issue has no long-term impact on AXTI, and we continue to believe AXTI is well positioned to leverage growth in the optical space driven by demand for InP and the potential opportunity around 3D sensing. With meaningful top and bottom-line growth ahead, we would be a buyer on any weakness related to this news." (3/16/2017)

Consensus Ratings for AXT (NASDAQ:AXTI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $8.20 (10.81% upside)

CHERRY HILL, NJ, March 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - TD Asset Management (TDAM) today announced plans to adjust its money fund lineup to address regulatory changes adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2014. The adjustments are summarized below and will take effect on October 14, 2016.  Throughout this process, our primary goal is to provide investors with a broad spectrum of product choices for liquidity management with little to no disruption.
Government Money Market Funds








In the government money market fund category, the following products will be offered:

TDAM U.S. Government Portfolio 
TDAM Institutional U.S. Government Fund 
TDAM Institutional Treasury Obligations Money Market Fund

Under the SEC's new rules, a government money market fund must invest at least 99.5% of its total assets in U.S. government securities, cash, or repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities or cash. Historically, TDAM has managed its government and Treasury funds consistent with this new requirement and will continue to do so. Government and Treasury money market funds are exempt from new requirements for liquidity fees and redemption gates, although they could voluntarily adopt fees and/or gates in the future upon prior notice to shareholders. TDAM does not intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on any of its government or Treasury funds. Finally, government funds will continue to use the amortized cost method of valuation to transact at a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1.00 per share. 
Retail Money Market Funds
In the retail money market fund category, the following products will be offered:

TDAM Money Market Portfolio 
TDAM Municipal Portfolio 
TDAM California Municipal Money Market Portfolio 
TDAM New York Municipal Money Market Portfolio

Retail money market funds are defined under the new rules as funds that have policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners to natural persons, whether investing directly or through an omnibus account held at a custodian. Retail money market funds will continue to transact at a stable NAV of $1.00 per share, but will be subject to liquidity fees and redemption gates. 
Institutional Money Market Funds
Prime and municipal money market funds that are available to institutional investors must transact at a floating NAV and will be subject to liquidity fees and redemption gates.  TDAM will offer the following floating NAV products:

TDAM Institutional Money Market Fund 
TDAM Institutional Municipal Money Market Fund

Many of the changes set out above will require approval from the funds' board of directors and disclosure in the funds' registration statements. Therefore, the changes will not take effect until the necessary approvals have been obtained and the disclosures have been filed.  TDAM's plan announced today should help investors move ahead with their liquidity planning solutions. 
About TD Asset ManagementTD Asset Management (TDAM), a member of TD Bank Group, is a North American investment management firm. Operating through TD Asset Management Inc. in Canada and TDAM USA Inc. in the U.S., TDAM brings new thinking to investors' most important challenges.
