Master Portfolio Service


















Individual Clients











































This service targets the best returns on a risk-adjusted basis.











Investec’s Master Portfolio Service combines a straightforward discretionary approach with access to a wide range of collective funds like unit and investment trusts.











Discretionary investment management with expert service
Based on collective funds, not individual securities
Designed for cash lump sums or existing portfolios from £40,000 to £150,000
Six risk-adjusted investment objectives spanning high- to low-risk portfolios
Flexibility to encompass General, ISA, SIPP and Offshore portfolios 











Our approach
Our team

Fees and charges


Our approach






Our Master Portfolio Service (MPS) is a discretionary service that’s designed around simplicity and diversity. As a segregated service, it allows you to invest in a variety of collective funds rather than individual shares.
This means that you own the underlying units in each fund, keeping you more closely involved with the funds that underpin your investment.











Our team






MPS is managed by a dedicated investment team with more than 50 years' experience. Our investment managers work closely with our research department to make decisions about the best blend of funds and asset allocation for each model portfolio.
What’s more, we keep administration as simple and clear as possible. We’ll give you a composite tax voucher at the end of the tax year and a six-monthly valuation and portfolio review.
For more regular reviews of your portfolio, log in to view your Online Portfolio Valuation.











Model portfolios






We help you choose from a range of six defined model portfolios:

Growth
Balanced
Income
Cautious
Defensive
High Growth

Each model contains a wide range of unit trusts, investment trusts and open-ended investment companies (OEICs), with each one representing a different style of investing.
Furthermore, MPS also offers an offshore solution with non-UK domiciled models.











Fees and charges






When we buy the underlying funds on your behalf, you’ll find the costs are often lower than the initial charges you’d typically face if you bought them directly.
You'll also benefit from lower ongoing (underlying) charges because we’re able to negotiate institutional rates on your behalf.
For further information, download our Master Portfolio Service rate card.




































How to apply

Call Matthew Salmon on 020 7597 1046 or send an email.

We’ll ask you some questions about your financial situation and investment objectives.
Once your application is approved we will set up an initial meeting with an investment manager.























The value of investments and the income derived from them can go up as well as down and you may not get back your initial investment.

Clsd-End Strgy: Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio (MSTR0009)
	
	




The information shown relates to a trust that is no longer offered for sale. This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy units of the trust.
Objective
The Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio is a unit trust that consists of approximately 30 exchange-traded closed-end funds. Chosen by Cohen & Steers, this portfolio seeks high current income.




 Objective The portfolio seeks high current income. The portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closed-end investment companies (known as "closed-end funds") selected by Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. Selection criteria generally include:Market cap generally greater than $300 millionAverage daily trading volume generally greater than $1 million per dayStrong fundamentals, including: - Liquidity - Income coverage and quality - Leverage/Risk managementWell-known advisor with experience managing the asset classDiversification of sector and asset classWhy invest in Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio?Potential income. The portfolio seeks to invest in securities that offer the potential for high current income.Expertise of Cohen & Steers. Many financial advisors and individual investors have neither the time nor resources to assess dividend quality, leverage, net asset value risk, and historical market valuation of closed-end funds. Cohen & Steers provides experience in selecting closed-end funds that may add value to your clients' portfolios.*Portfolio diversification. Diversification of assets across several different fund managers, asset classes and sectors helps manage risk and offers investors the opportunity to further enhance the diversification of a balanced portfolio.Potential capital appreciation. At the time of selection, many of the funds in the portfolio were trading at a discount to their net asset value, which can potentially capture value and enhance total returns.* Cohen & Steers does not manage any of the funds in the portfolio and does not manage the trust itself.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.You will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses, but also those of the underlying funds. By investing in other funds, the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of closed-end fund shares may decrease.Certain of the closed-end may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios. While leverage often increases the yield of a closed-end fund, it also increases risks, including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closed-end fund’s common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises.Certain of the closed-end funds invest in bonds issued by foreign issuers. Such bonds are subject to certain risks including currency and interest rate fluctuations, nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments, lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.The yield on closed-end funds which invest in bonds will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.Senior loans and High yield bonds are generally below investment grade quality (“junk” bonds). Investing in such bonds should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such bonds. Junk bonds are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. Junk bond prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.You will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses, but also those of the underlying funds. By investing in other funds, the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of closed-end fund shares may decrease.Certain of the closed-end may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios. While leverage often increases the yield of a closed-end fund, it also increases risks, including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closed-end fund’s common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises.Certain of the closed-end funds invest in bonds issued by foreign issuers. Such bonds are subject to certain risks including currency and interest rate fluctuations, nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments, lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.The yield on closed-end funds which invest in bonds will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.Senior loans and High yield bonds are generally below investment grade quality (“junk” bonds). Investing in such bonds should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such bonds. Junk bonds are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. Junk bond prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.
