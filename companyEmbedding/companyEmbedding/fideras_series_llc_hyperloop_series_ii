Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Technology Expo


Based in Detroit, Michigan, America’s capital for electric-vehicle manufacturing, Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Technology Expo highlights advances right across the powertrain. From passenger and commercial vehicles to off-highway industrial vehicles, this manufacturing and engineering event showcases the latest innovations across a vast range of vehicles. Running concurrent to the exhibition is the Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Technology Conference, which attracts technical leaders and executives from global technology companies to reveal what is driving demand, and shaping novel technologies and new innovations at the cutting edge.
The wide-ranging sessions cover performance vehicle technology transfer, technology transfer from aerospace to EV, technologies for improving efficiency and performance of H/EVs, the impact of autonomous driving features, 48V and low-voltage mild-hybrid architectures (including energy storage design considerations), electric and hybrid bus development, the commercial and vocational electric vehicle sector, P0-P4 architectures and more.
Since 2010 this dual event has experienced exponential growth achieving a sell-out exhibition and record attendance year on year, and bringing in some of the leading names as exhibitors, speakers, delegates and visitors, including Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, American Airlines, Hyundai, Ford, Valeo, BorgWarner, NovaBus, Chrysler, NASA, GM and many more.
Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Technology Expo is attended by industry leaders, businesspeople, technicians, consultants, and research and development professionals, all looking for greater efficiency, safety, and cost reduction.

Future Electronics, Delta Ink Global Franchise Agreement

Spencer Chin

31 October 2016









Global electronics distributor Future Electronics has announced an expanded worldwide franchise agreement with Delta Products Corporation’s Industrial, Medical and Lighting Power Supply group, adding to the fans and filters already available through Future Electronics in North America. 


 Delta produces high efficiency standard and custom power supplies for the industrial, medical, lighting and consumer market places, and is considered the preferred supplier for the largest percentage of major Tier 1 customers. Their standard off-the shelf industrial and medical approved AC-DC power supplies range from 10 W to 2000 W in various package types including open frame, enclosed, DIN rail and external adapters. 


 “We are thrilled to establish this new level of partnership with the Delta Electronics Group,” said Heather Goldsmith, director of marketing at Future Electronics, in a statement. “We look forward to offering an even broader portfolio of power supplies for our consumer, medical, lighting and industrial customers on a global basis.” 


 Michelle Luo, vice president of sales and product development for Delta, reiterated the company's excitement. 


 “We are impressed by their outstanding level of customer service and commitment to our new partnership, and we look forward to working with them in a joint effort toward continued mutual success,” said Luo.

Gas-filled Surge Arresters Protect Base Station Supplies

Spencer Chin

09 November 2016









LNP20C-A1800AC-6C surge arrester. Source: TDK TDK Corporation has introduced gas-filled EPCOS surge arresters for use in base stations. The components have three terminals and are able to extinguish over-voltages both from L to PE as well as N to PE. The LNP20C-A1800AC-6C surge arrester is designed for an operating voltage of 250 VAC. It meets the IEC 61643-11 requirements for classes I and II; with a wave form of 8/20 µs, it offers a maximum discharge current of 16 kA (class II).
In order to offer the necessary over-voltage protection, the surge arrester is designed for a follow current of 1 kA. The response time is less than 100 ns. The RoHS-compatible component with the ordering code B88069X4023B201 is RoHS compatible, measures 39 mm × 25.2 mm × 27.5 mm, and its insulation resistance is 1 GΩ at 100 V DC.

Persons who respond to the collection of information contained in this form are not required to respond unless the form displays a currently valid OMB number.
* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
