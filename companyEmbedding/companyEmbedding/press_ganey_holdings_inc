Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Press Ganey Holdings Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on today's call from Press Ganey are Patrick Ryan, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Greskoviak, President and Chief Operating Officer; Breht Feigh, Chief Financial Officer; and Balaji Gandhi, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy.
As a reminder this call is being recorded. Before we begin I would like to point all of you to the forward-looking statements disclosure in the company's earnings press release for information about forward-looking statements that may be made or discussed on this call. The earnings press release is posted on Press Ganey's website.
Please review the information along with the risk factors included in the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for a disclosure of the factors that may cause actual future results to be materially different than those expressed on this morning's call.
Management will be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Please review the earnings press release for reconciliations to most comparable GAAP numbers.
And now I’d like to turn the call over to Patrick Ryan, Chief Executive Officer, Press Ganey. Mr. Ryan, please go ahead.
Patrick Ryan
I’d like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning I’ll review Press Ganey's value proposition, strategic framework, and high level second quarter performance. Joe will provide an update on operations, including our progress with the Avatar integration, and our initiatives around consumerism and nursing performance. Breht will wrap up with a detailed review of the financials and our 2016 guidance.
As I’ve shared with you in the past, healthcare continues to experience the most significant transformation that I've seen in my 36-plus years in the industry. Although this creates some level of disruption, as organizations look to redesign care, there’s also a period of accelerated innovation that will ultimately advance our industry.
Healthcare systems are seeking strategic partners to help them adopt high-reliability practices that will achieve safe, high-quality care that meets patients’ needs and reduces suffering. Numerous independent studies over time have reinforced the correlations between safety culture, caregiver engagement, clinical quality and the patient experience.
To achieve meaningful and sustainable improvement, healthcare systems must align around shared goals to achieve the ideal patient experience across the continuum of care. Over the last four years Press Ganey’s unique value proposition has evolved to support this enterprisewide approach through deep data, advanced analytics, advisory services and consulting expertise.
Press Ganey’s approach achieves an integrated view of the patients’ overall care experience and pinpoints through segmentation the needs of unique patient populations. Our value extends beyond any one product or data set. Through our suite of solutions, we are able to partner with organizations across the continuum of care to fulfill on a shared mission to reduce patient and caregiver suffering.

By organizing performance insights and solutions around what matters most to our clients and the patients they serve, Press Ganey plays a significant role as a partner in improving the overall continuum of care.
Whilst it’s been a busy year-to-date, remains a priority of our team to meet with healthcare executives, leadership teams and boards of directors across our client organizations to better understand their strategic priorities and to partner to develop innovative programs that drive continued transformation.
Moving to our performance. We are pleased to report a solid second quarter 2016 results that we believe demonstrate the continued evolution of our products and our continued thought leadership. The key highlights from the second quarter 2016 are as follows: strong revenue growth of 17.8% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 24.5% on strong organic revenue growth of 11%; continued strength in revenue retention at 94% and client retention at 97% on a rolling three-year average basis; and census-based survey penetration of 48% of patient experience revenue, excluding the acquired Avatar patient experience book of business.
I’ll remind you the growth in census-based surveys is based upon the recognition by our client that this rich data gives organizations deeper insights into their systems, accelerating innovation, improvement and operational sustainability.
Moving onto our corporate development activity. The acquisitions of HPI and Avatar and our partnership with Binary Fountain have created solid growth opportunities above and beyond the 7% to 9% long-term organic growth rate forecast that we’ve communicated to you in the past.
Our M&A and partnership pipelines remain robust. We see many opportunities to leverage our size, scale, and thought leadership to deepen and expand our offerings. As always, we will maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating our opportunities.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?
Joe Greskoviak
Thank you, Pat. Overall, our associates delivered another solid quarter. In addition to the new solutions Pat discussed, we continue to make investment to enhance our existing product offerings and day-to-day operating platform. Our team continues to do an excellent job of managing our growth. 
The second quarter brought the added challenge of transitioning Avatar clients onto the Press Ganey platform. We are encouraged by the early efforts in terms of contracting, pricing and the overall on-boarding process as well as the receptivity of Press Ganey solutions by Avatar client.
We were also fortunate to add a great deal of talent through the acquisition. While there is still work to be done we believe that we are on track to achieve our integration milestones in the second half 2016
In a moment Breht will update our financial guidance around Avatar. I would like to personally thank the Avatar team for their professionalism and all of our associates for their planning and hard work which is driving the very theme transition of Avatar clients to the Press Ganey platform.
We look forward to working closely with our new clients as we expand our relationships over time. Our investment in internal product development and our strategic acquisitions over the past several years have positioned our sales team to sale an enterprise solution. The enterprise approach has driven our sale success in prior quarters and that momentum has carried into the second quarter across the platform.
As we look out over the remaining months of the year, the sales pipeline remains solid. Our transparency program and our partnership with Binary Fountain fit nicely into the overall enterprise strategic approach and has been well received by clients support end to end functionality that enables providers to publish physician star ratings and patient comments on their websites. We will continue to work with our clients under transparency journey to protect the integrity of their brands, drive greater patient loyalty and improve provider performance. 

At the end of the fourth quarter we will launch our nursing performance solution. This product leverages data from multiple Press Ganey solutions to offer a single source for magnet readiness and reporting requirements and will identify opportunities for our clients to drive nursing excellence, adding another important view into the health system. It’s early days for both of these products, but we will afford to give you an updated guidance when we discuss our thoughts later this year regarding 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Breht.
Breht Feigh
Thank you, Joe. Good morning. I'll review our financial results for the second quarter today and will focus much of my commentary on the supplemental financial data tables included in the earnings press release issued yesterday. These tables provide a detailed explanation and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to our GAAP income statement.
Our second quarter 2016 GAAP revenue increased 17.8% from $77.5 million in 2015 to $91.2 million in 2016. Revenue growth consisted of 10.8% organic growth and 7% acquisition growth. Patient experience, caregiver engagement and consulting solutions all contributed to the organic revenue growth being above our 7% to 9% long-term target.
Organic revenue growth benefited from sales, client retention and solid execution of on-boarding new patient experience contracts. Our September 2015 acquisition of healthcare performance improvement contributed 3.1% of acquisition growth and our May 2016 acquisition of Avatar contributed 3.9% of the acquisition growth.
Avatar specifically contributed $3 million of revenue for the two months of May and June. Included in Avatar's results is $1 million of revenue from organizations that will not continue his client beyond their contractual terms with Avatar.
These organizations include workforce engagement clients that operate outside of the healthcare industry and certain patient experience clients who have given notice of their planned termination prior to our acquisition. I will provide guidance around Avatar for the remainder of the year later in my comments.
Clients with census-based surveying excluding Avatar's patient experience revenue increased to 48% up from 44% in the first quarter of 2016 and 33% in the second quarter of 2015 demonstrating the value and continuing success of this product solution. Including Avatar's revenue census-based surveying was 46% of patient experience revenue in the quarter. As we move forward, we will incorporate Avatar clients into the calculation.
For the quarter, non-GAAP cost of revenue increased 15.8% from $32.5 million in 2015 to $37.6 million in 2016. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP cost of revenue decreased 70 basis points to 41.2%. The improvement was largely driven by leveraging our personnel costs as we continue to witness a greater percentage of electronic surveys for our patient experience solutions.
For the quarter non-GAAP general and administrative expense increased 9.5% from $15.9 million in 2015 to $17.4 million in 2016. As a percentage of revenue non-GAAP general and administrative expense decreased 150 basis points to 19%, reflecting the leveraging of our general and administrative costs as a result of organic and acquisition revenue growth.
Non-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense increased 20.4% from $6.1 million in 2015 to $7.3 million in 2016. The $1.2 million increase is largely related to our technology investments in our digital platform over the past three years.
As a result of the items just discussed, non-GAAP income from operations increased 25.6% from $23 million in 2015 to $28.9 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.5% from $29.1 million in 2015 to $36.3 million in 2016. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income is provided in a separate table in our earnings press release.

Now I’ll review non-operating expenses/earnings. Interest expense decreased $2.7 million from $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.1 million in this year’s second quarter. The decrease in interest expense reflects lower borrowings following the pay-down of debt with proceeds from our initial public offering, free cash flow generation, and a reduction of interest rate as a result of refinancing our debt in July 2015.
Non-GAAP provision for taxes was $8.3 million for the prior year second and $11.8 million for this year's second quarter. We’ve utilized an effective income tax rate of 42.4% in our supplemental financial data, which allows for normal run rate non-deductible expenses.
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased 46.3% from $10.9 million in 2015 to $16 million in 2016. The adjustments include non-recurring and non-comparable items detailed in the footnotes to supplemental financial data table along with the add-back of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisition.
Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the quarter increased 28% from $0.23 in 2015 to $0.30 in 2016 for the reasons just discussed, offset by 14.2% increase in weighted shares outstanding.
I’d now like to review cash flow activities. Cash flow from operations was $20.9 million for the second quarter and $52.1 million for the six months. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations increased 38.8% or $14.6 million as a result of increased profitability, including lower cash interest expense as a result of reduced debt outstanding and lower interest rates and an improvement in working capital management.
Net cash used in investing activities was $25 million for the second quarter and $31 million for the first six months of 2016. During the quarter, we acquired Avatar for $16.7 million, we made an equity investment in Binary Fountain and had capital expenditures of $6.2 million.
Our capital expenditures were almost entirely attributable to capitalized software development costs as we continue to invest in our digital platform. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures of $30.1 million represents 83% of adjusted EBITDA and increased 30% over the prior year quarter.
Next I’d like to review our capital structure. We had indebtedness in capitalized leases of $136.2 million, net of 46.4 million of cash, a reduction of $17.8 million from our year-end 2015 balance of the $154 million. Our debt to EBIT for bank covenant compliance purposes was 0.95 times on a maximum covenant of 3.75 times and our $75 million revolving credit facility was undrawn.
I’d like to conclude my discussion this morning by commenting on our 2016 outlook. In updating our guidance I will discuss the impact of the Avatar acquisition separately. We are now expecting revenue of $361 million and adjusted EBITDA of $141 million excluding the impact of the Avatar acquisition. This revised outlook reflects our strong performance in the first half of 2016.
Now to comment on the -- on Avatar for the balance of the year. Excluding revenue tied to non-healthcare industry clients and contract terminations known to us we completed the acquisition, we estimate that the Avatar will contribute approximately $5.5 million to $6 million of patient experience and caregiver engagement revenue from continuing clients during the remainder of 2016 and have no material contribution to 2016 adjusted EBITDA.
As we look to 2017 we're making solid progress with transitioning Avatar clients to Press Ganey's breadth of solutions, pricing construct and contract term. Based on our current discussions and negotiations with these clients, we would expect them to generate revenue of $1 million to $1.1 million per month in 2017.
Given our anticipated success in transitioning Avatar's clients to our service model, uptake of our greater offering of product solutions and pricing, we do not anticipate breaking out the revenue contribution from Avatar's clients between acquired growth and organic growth in 2017.

Our 2016 revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations are based on our existing client base and anticipated 2016 sales, these full year expectations also incorporate the higher expense and lower margins in the fourth quarter that are associated with our National Client Conference.
These, of course, are projections and should our 2016 client retention, revenue retention or sales performance diverge from our expected performance, our outlook for 2016 revenue and adjusted EBITDA would be impacted. The business is historically been fairly predictable within a relatively narrow range, therefore we've chosen to give our best estimate as of this call.
I will now pass the call back to Pat.
Patrick Ryan
Thank you, Breht. Operator, we're opening it up the lines for questions, please. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
Patrick Ryan
Good morning, Richard. 
Richard Close
Good morning. Congratulations on a strong first half for the year. I was wondering you talked a little bit about the nursing, if you can go into a little bit more detail exactly what you're rolling out in the second half.
And then your one of the competitors in the space HealthStream has done a couple of acquisitions with respect to the nursing area and I was wondered if you could just enlighten us, may be what the differences are between what you guys are doing and what may be HealthStream is doing is a complementary or is a competitive and just give us some insight on that front.
Patrick Ryan
Sure. Happy to do that. So the nursing performance solutions for us will rollout at the end of the fourth quarter. We will introduce it at our National Client Conference in November formally. We have got some 28 clients who have been participating in the build of that program over time early adopters to that product. And what it's going to do is collect a number of analytics around overall nursing performance and allow hospitals who are on the magnet journey or those who are not to really look at analytics around overall nursing performance and automate a lot of the data that is not currently automated today.
So I think that will be very well received in the marketplace based upon our early work and market analysis. I think it’s complementary to what HealthStream is doing largely around certification and education for nursing. So I don't view those two as competitor. 
Richard Close
Okay. I guess my second question here would be with respect to star ratings and I mean obviously you have the transparency product that's increasingly being rolled out. It seems to be a lot of controversy over these star ratings and maybe if you could just chime in, in terms of your thoughts of star ratings going forward as dictated by CMS and just thoughts in and around that, that would be great
Patrick Ryan
Yeah, I would take a step back and overall talking about measurement and consumerism in the marketplace I think the train has left the station and everyone recognizes that consumers need more data in order to make informed decisions about health systems. The debate comes around the quality of the data and the speed with which it’s available to the consumer, and so we’re supportive of measuring performance. The challenge for some organizations is whether it's scientifically collected and the real-time nature of that, and I think the industry will evolve to real-time data, so that consumers can make informed decisions.
As you look at our platform, the advantage we have is our data analytics are scientifically collected across the board, the data is real-time and we use the CMS construct from which to go through our calculation, so it's complementary there. So if you are a health system and you're looking at moving towards transparency, you want to work with an organization that has the right data sets and have those data sets in real-time.

Richard Close
All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Matthew Gillmor
Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one follow-up to Richard's question on the NDNQI product transition. Can you maybe just help us understand how that transition will take place? Will the existing clients on that product automatically transition to the new product or will there be a sales process associated with transitioning the existing client base?
Patrick Ryan
There will be a sales process with NDNQI. People will continue to use that product. They are complementary in forum and the product will continue to evolve over time. So don't think of any of our products really as a static state. We continue to involve the analytic. And as you think about our business today, it's really about collecting a robust data set to provide deeper insights into the health systems’ operations and help drive improvement and overall care coordination. So as you think of our nursing product and NDNQI, think of them as continually evolving with time.
Matthew Gillmor
And then one sort of bigger picture question on the white-space opportunity and some of the CAHPS requirements that are ahead of us and as we think about the expansion of the CAHPS programs into other areas within that continuum of care over the next several years, and I guess I was thinking specifically of hospital outpatient, ASCs, and emergency departments. Can you give us a sense for how penetrated those areas are already and is that already really part of the discussion with clients during 2016 and 2017?
Patrick Ryan
Yeah, I would say that it’s already a discussion with the majority of our clients, lots of them. There still remains white space in that area, but the discussion has been ongoing for some time. We have a number of clients who we measure in all of those areas to date. But the way to look at CAHPS as we go forward is it continues to be an accelerant in the business, both from the standpoint of just straight up doing the CAHPS work but more importantly looking at the overall analytic across the health system and moving from CAHPS to its operating data that's about sustaining your overall operation.
So I think it’s an accelerant to growth and continues to be so. But the majority of our conversation with health systems is really about the entire enterprise and how one drives improvement and care coordination.
Matthew Gillmor
Great. Thanks very much for taking the question.
Operator
You next question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.
Ryan Daniels
Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Pat, let me ask a follow up for you on the census-based surveying. That’s seen very consistent growth over last few years and I’m curious based on the type of clients that have adopted that to date if you internally have a view of what the ultimate penetration of CBS could look like over the next few years.
Patrick Ryan
I wouldn’t project out ultimately for you, but what I would say about CBS is that that is a foundational element to looking at your health system on an enterprise view and having insights across the operation to drive improvement. So those of our clients who have census-based surveying are own able to then take advantage of our nursing product, our engagement products, and the integrated view that goes with it: loyalty, brand, et cetera. 
So without it, it limits the insights that you can draw across your enterprise. So I would expect it would continue to grow. And one question I've been asked is, does it make sense for smaller hospitals to do it versus larger hospitals. And I would say if I were a hospital CEO, it makes sense no matter what size hospital I’m running.

Ryan Daniels
Okay. That’s helpful color. And then in regards to the transparency tool, I guess a twofold question: one, hoping to get a bit of an update on the Binary relationship and maybe how that's helping you sell it or implement more rapidly. And then number two, it seems like a lot of marquee providers guys, you know, the Cleveland clinic et cetera have adopted that.
I am curious if you see them as early adopters and then it will lag or if this type of solution once marquee player has it all others in the market will kind of be required to have that to meet consumer demand.
Patrick Ryan
So the relationship with Binary Fountain is going very well. The response from our clients has been excellent. We will provide you with some detailed guidance as we go into 2017 with regard to our expectations for its contribution in 2017. As far as the large systems moving towards it, I view this as a must for any health system. So, if you look at the major MSAs and as a system moves towards transparency I think you'll see other competitive systems move towards transparency with time. We've seen an uptick in it and I would expect that will continue with time.
Ryan Daniels
Okay. Thanks and congrats to the strong start to the year. 
Patrick Ryan
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Nicholas Jensen with Raymond James. Your line is open. 
Nicholas Jensen
Hey, guys. Pat congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to follow-up on that last point on the transparency solution. Just wanted to get a sense as you present more information going forward, how we think about the revenue model? Is it on a per doc basis? I noticed you have a lot of this census-based surveying growth because you actually need that detailed real-time information to drive the transparency solution, but I just wanted to get your better sense of kind of the revenue model, how is it evolved since the Binary Fountain partnership has come about? 
Patrick Ryan
So, it’s going well and as I said we will provide you with some guidance at the end of the third quarter with regard to 2017, and obviously, we were pleased to date with the pipeline and build out to the process. So as far as the pricing and the way in which we sell it, it will probably depend upon the provider. There is per doc calculations and there is overall enterprise pricing with regard to our relationships with clients, so it'll take on probably several different models.
Nicholas Jensen
Okay. That's helpful. And then on the EBITDA margin continued to be quite strong. I assume the transition more towards census base kind of helps that margin projection. But just want to get your sense of was there anything in the quarter or really driving kind of that strong margin performance because the incremental EBITDA growth relative to guidance race and the topline was quite good. Thanks. 
Patrick Ryan
I wouldn't say there's anything unique to the other quarters. We continue to expand the census base. We maintain cost controls across our G&A and we always focus in those areas. So I wouldn't say there's anything unique about the quarter.
Nicholas Jensen
Great. That's all guys.
Patrick Ryan
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Andre Benjamin
Hi. Good morning. 
Patrick Ryan
Hi, Andre. How are you? 
Andre Benjamin
I am doing well. Thanks. So you said Avatar is going to have a revenue impact, but not much EBITDA contribution this year. You talked a bit about revenue impact next year. So I just want to think about EBITDA for 2017 knowing you are not giving explicit guidance. Maybe if I can ask you this way, all else equal if that business were flat in revenue year-over-year, was you still report no EBITDA in 2017 or would some EBITDA flow through as you improve the cost structure and some organic growth.

Patrick Ryan
So what I have said is with regard to Avatar you could -- you should expect at a minimum a similar margin to our own business on that revenue in 2017 and we will provide specific guidance as we go into the third quarter with regard to the business. But it’s performing, while the transition is going very well for us and you should expect that business would perform very consistently to our own business at a minimum.
Andre Benjamin
Great. And I know you don't give explicit figures on product lines. But any color you could provide on how much the organic growth has been driven by the core patient experience platform versus some of the other areas such as clinical engagement consultants are just trying to get a sense of penetration beyond the core platform.
Patrick Ryan
The comments that I have made in the past and that they are consistent for this quarter as well is that the platform performs well across the enterprise. And as we go out further in the future the way in which we contract generally includes a number of our products as we as -- we grow the business, so it’s really an enterprise pricing model. But really in all categories we performed pretty well. 
Andre Benjamin
Thank you. 
Operator
The next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Jamie Stockton
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my…
Patrick Ryan
Hey, Jamie. 
Jamie Stockton
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe a couple on the transparency solution. I think Nick alluded to this earlier, but can you talk about what kind of a benefit you receive with the census-based surveying work, when health system adopt transparency incrementally, I mean, essentially are you guys getting paid to go back and hit people multiple times to try to improve the response rate so that you have rich enough data? You know, are there any percentages you can share about how much of an increase in contract value that generally drive.
Patrick Ryan
So the way to think about transparency is it dependent upon a health system using census-based survey to collect the right amount of data and census-based surveying can increase the data collection, you know, 100% to 200% depends on the clients and the way in which we approach it. That provides an end size significant enough to really allow providers to drive improvement through that process. So core to deeper analytics, core to segmentation and segmentation is the future of driving performance in health systems is census-based products. So that's foundational to transparency.
And then the other thing to think about with regard to transparency is scientifically collected data and providing certainty for our clients that that is being reported in scientific manner and that our clients are reporting a 100% of their work excluding some comments that may be viewed as inappropriate or PHI, so that approach is important to transparency in building your brand in a community.
As far as pricing on that I won't common on pricing just because the number of our competitors love to listen to these calls. But what I will say is it's a nice business for us and I would expect that it will add margin with time over the years and we will give you a little more specifics with regard to of that in the third quarter.
Jamie Stockton
Okay. And then maybe just one other question on that front which is some of these early adopters of the transparency solution, are you seeing any of them post quality scores that you're coming up with or the qualitative information on websites other than the providers on website? And if they are, can you talk about any of those other platforms? You know, are you essentially spreading some of the certified quality data on third-party platforms.
Patrick Ryan

We haven't seen that in any significant way to-date. And there is a way for them to do it and for us to partner to help them through the process, but we haven't seen that at this point time in significant way. Keep in mind one of the things that going to the transparency model helps the hospital to drive traffic to their website to move them up this Google search to the top of the list within your community so and sharing that with other websites one has to think about what you're driving and the value you're giving other sites.
Jamie Stockton
Okay. That's great. Thank you. 
Patrick Ryan
You are welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners. Your line is open. 
Patrick Ryan
Hi, Peter. 
Peter Heckmann
Good morning. Just wanted to talk about some of the changes in surveys as regards pain management and what role Press Ganey played in that as thought leader?
Patrick Ryan
So we were supportive of taking those questions out of the calculation for value. Largely we still believe you need to measure pain as the indicator in any health system. But the politics around those questions were confusing the facts. So taking them out and getting away from using those questions in the debates around the issues with regard to the drug issues throughout the country I think was important to take those questions out. So we were supportive of that.
I would emphasize to you that we studied this subject numerous times and several outside sources have studied and the subjects around drug use and the pain questions and there's really no correlation associated to those. But I think it's good that they're taking them out of the debate so that we can focus on what the real issues are.
Peter Heckmann
Okay. And then longer term question do you think some of the new regulations coming down the pike with regards to reimbursement will spur further consolidation, practice management groups consolidating with larger systems, and then how does that affect pricing and potentially the need to bundle services going forward? 
Patrick Ryan
So I would say consolidation in my estimate will continue throughout the health system in general. The -- and for us that's been a positive largely in that we're very strong in the major top 50 MSAs around the country from a market share standpoint. It allows us to integrate our product across the enterprise. I think our approach is attractive to that model, so I think it's a overall benefit for us as time goes on.
Peter Heckmann
Okay. That's helpful. I will get back in the queue. 
Patrick Ryan
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Silber
Thanks so much. I think you had said earlier on the call that your census-based survey revenue was about 33% last year to 46% this year, including Avatar. If my math is correct that would imply that your non-census-based survey revenue went down year-over-year, is that correct? Or is it maybe just a classification issue, but if not is there something going there that we should be aware about? Thanks. 
Patrick Ryan
There is nothing going on that you should be aware of. It is just the conversion is the way to think about that we have existing clients that are moving to census which generally increases the overall value of the contract but you should see that number continue to go up in our overall calculation. But it is added to the overall revenue.
Jeff Silber
Okay. That's helpful. And I know you don’t give specific quarterly guidance, but is there anything that we should be aware about 3Q versus 4Q anything going on differently for me revenue perspective or on expense perspective? Thanks. 
Patrick Ryan
The only thing to keep in mind in the fourth quarter we have our expenses for the National Client Conference, so you see margin drop in that quarter consistent with prior years. 

Jeff Silber
But nothing different from last year though.
Patrick Ryan
Nothing that I'm aware of. No.
Jeff Silber
Okay. Thanks so much. 
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Donald Hooker
So my question again census-based surveying which is so important watching that percentage go up every quarter which is great. Do we think of -- is it something that -- is it part of -- typically part of the renewal process I mean you got transition from sort of the standard surveys to the digital surveys, is it something that comes up -- is that transition typically occur during the renewal process and is that what's driving that increasing percentage or does it sort of go up itself organically?
Patrick Ryan
It’s part of the contracting process. Think about it really as the move is to collecting deeper data and the people recognizing that segmentation and analytics are playing a more important role in the overall health system. So what census-based surveying simply does for us is allow us to collect very cost efficiently materially more data for our clients and then to run across our analytic platform to give them much more specific insights. So you see in both the renewal process and the sales process and in the conversion process with Avatar that is part of the discussion.
Donald Hooker
Okay. And then maybe a second question, a similar question I asked in a different way maybe when you think about some of the bundled payment program you said coming out of CMS I think you will have a small patient reported outcomes business that I believe is probably pretty small part of the business now, but is there an application there that we should think about around some of the new bundles that might be coming out here shortly and maybe can you elaborate on that as an extension to your current patients experience offering.
Patrick Ryan
Sure. Two things to think about with regard to bundle payments, one is if you have the census-based survey data and you're looking at orthopedic or cardiac bundles, you then to look at cardiac patients or orthopedic patients and how their in fact responding and what is their patient experience because you got enough data to look at subsets identified by the clinical experience. So it is an important move if you're going to start to try to segment by patient population.
Number two is around the PROMs-based product or patient reported outcome measures we have a very small business at this point in time. It’s in our 2017 roadmap to continue to enhance that product. We would expect that to rollout, you know, in 2018. It is not -- there is no numbers in any of our guidance related to it, but with time that product I think will be in a position to take advantage of it as the market starts to adopt them. 
Donald Hooker
Okay. I guess that's all for now. Thanks so much.
Patrick Ryan
You are welcome. 
Operator
Last question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. 
Richard Close
If we look at the 10.8% organic growth, is there any way to split that up in terms of how much of coming, you know, from existing customers, may be ramping up to this census-based surveying, how much -- maybe you guys taking market share from others?
Patrick Ryan
We said in the past that look at sort of 77% to 80% of our new business comes to existing clients, and so I think that's the way to look at it. I think the number itself is being affected by a number of things. Sales have been solid. Our cross sales have been solid with our engagement consulting products and then census-based surveying site, I think it’s been impacted by all of those numbers.
Richard Close
Okay. Thank you. 
Patrick Ryan
You are welcome.
Operator
We have no further questions. I turn the call back over to the presenters.

Patrick Ryan
Well, thank you so much for participating in the call. We look forward to reporting out in the third quarter, and as always we appreciate your support. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

Press Ganey Holdings, Inc.: Initiation of Research Coverage

            Monday, June 15, 2015







William Blair & Company initiated research coverage of Press Ganey Holdings, Inc. (PGND $26.94) with an Outperform rating and Established Growth company profile. Press Ganey is a leading provider, and thought leader, in the patient experience measurement and improvement space.
Analyst Ryan Daniels estimated that the company, which is the largest provider of Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys in the United States, would generate adjusted earnings per share of $0.84 in 2015 and $1.00 in 2016.
“In our view, Press Ganey has myriad attractive financial characteristics,” Daniels said. “These include a 97% client retention rate, which drives recurring revenues and strong sales and EPS visibility; a strong cash conversion cycle with limited working capital needs; a diversified client base with no material sales concentration; strong profit margins—adjusted EBITDA was more than 36% in 2014; consistent, high-single-digit organic growth trends; and strong return on invested capital characteristics. In addition, Press Ganey has one of the largest client bases we have seen in the healthcare industry—covering nearly two-thirds of all acute-care hospitals, nearly three-fourths of all large medical practices, and more than 80% of all teaching hospitals in the United States. This affords the company a comparative database that is unmatched in the industry, which is a critical and sustainable competitive advantage for the organization.”
Daniels continued, “We see Press Ganey as an organization positioned at the center of an expanding patient experience measure and improvement market—one which should experience a significant increase in demand over the coming years, in our opinion. Moreover, its scale, along with a very strong brand in the healthcare market, affords the organization a unique distribution opportunity that can be leveraged to sell new solutions into the existing client base. Thus, we not only see a significant addressable market in the present at nearly $4 billion, but also expect the opportunity to increase by roughly 50% over the next four or five years.”
William Blair & Company is a global investment banking and asset management firm. We are committed to building enduring relationships with our clients and providing expertise and solutions to meet their evolving needs. An independent and employee-owned firm, William Blair is based in Chicago, with offices in 16 cities across five continents. For more information, please visit williamblair.com.

Individual ratings and price targets (where used) reflect the expected performance of the stock relative to the broader market (generally the S&P 500, unless otherwise indicated) over the next 12 months. The assessment of expected performance is a function of near-, intermediate-, and long-term company fundamentals, industry outlook, confidence in earnings estimates, valuation (and our valuation methodology), and other factors. Outperform (O) – stock expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M) – stock expected to perform approximately in line with the broader market over the next 12 months; Underperform (U) – stock expected to underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR) – the stock is not currently rated. The valuation methodologies used to determine price targets (where used) include (but are not limited to) price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with the relevant market), P/E-to-growth-rate (PEG) ratio, market capitalization/revenue multiple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.
 
Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over a longer-term horizon, of the business risk of the company relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track record, market leadership, distinctive capabilities); 2) financial profile (earnings growth rate/consistency, cash flow generation, return on investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, confidence in long-term growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E) – Fundamental risk is lower relative to the broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C) – Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A) – Fundamental risk is higher relative to the broader William Blair universe.
 
The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion of the individual analyst and are subject to change at any time.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be $203.3 million (or
$234.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to repay $175.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan 
Facility, (ii) to pay a one-time transaction advisory fee of $8.5 million to 
Vestar and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in additional 
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no 
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard.

Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this 
offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the U.S. government.

As of March 31, 2015, the interest rate on our Term Loan Facility, which is 
scheduled to mature on April 20, 2018, was 4.25%.


We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses in a fragmented and 
rapidly changing market. Competition in the patient experience and performance
improvement industry is largely based on analytical capabilities and healthcare
industry expertise, breadth and depth of services, the size and quality of the
underlying datasets and benchmarks, ease of use, reputation, innovation, 
security, price, reliability and client service. While we believe that no 
competitor provides the breadth of our suite of solutions or the size and 
quality of our datasets and benchmarks, we nevertheless compete with other 
companies with regards to specific products or solutions and markets or care
settings. We compete with various large and small healthcare data, analytics,
services and consulting companies.

We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of 
consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. The
anticipated growth in healthcare spending, the shift to a value-based payment
model, the rise of consumerism and changes in government regulation may draw 
increasing attention to healthcare data and analytics, and new competitors, such
as management consultants, technology companies and start-ups may enter the 
market, and we may face increased competition from these sources.


Company Description
Press Ganey is a leading provider of patient experience measurement, performance
analytics and strategic advisory solutions for healthcare organizations across
the continuum of care. Our mission is to help healthcare organizations reduce 
patient suffering and improve clinical quality, safety and


 the patient 
experience. We provide our clients with innovative, technology-based solutions 
that capture the perspectives of patients, physicians, nurses and other 
healthcare employees, which enable our clients to benchmark, analyze and improve
the patient's care experience. We support clients in achieving the "Triple Aim"
of improving the patient experience, managing their population's health and 
controlling costs through improved patient engagement and experience of care. We
believe we offer a powerful value proposition to the healthcare industry, as we
help drive transformational change through greater performance transparency, 
better care coordination and sustainable performance improvements.

With nearly 30 years of experience, Press Ganey is recognized as a pioneer and 
thought leader in the approximately $3.7 billion U.S. market for patient 
experience measurement and performance improvement solutions. We believe clients
value our solutions because of our scientific rigor in capturing and analyzing
the patient experience, as well as our ability to interpret data and create
actionable insights that positively impact the clinical, safety, operational and
financial performance of healthcare organizations. We combine proprietary 
information with advanced analytics and a flexible software delivery interface
to present targeted findings and predictive insights for improving patient care
and outcomes. Our solutions identify key causes of variability in performance
and correlate these to best practices observed across a wide population of 
providers. We utilize data on a secure, client-specific basis, as well as on an
aggregated, de-identified basis, to enable our clients to understand their own
performance with a high degree of specificity and to benchmark their performance
against other providers and industry best practices. We believe our clients view
us as a trusted partner that shares their commitment to reducing patient 
suffering through continuous, patient-centric performance improvement.

Our clients are represented across the continuum of care and include hospitals,
medical practices and other healthcare providers. As of January 1, 2015, we 
served more than 22,000 healthcare facilities, including 62% of acute care  
hospitals in the United States, 81% of acute care hospitals in the United States
with more than 100 beds and 73% of medical practices in the United States with 
more than 50 physicians. We have strong and long-standing relationships with 
distinguished healthcare providers, including 89% of major teaching hospitals in
the United States, and the average duration of our relationships with our 
hospital clients is approximately eight years. From 2012 to 2014, our average 
annual revenue retention rate was approximately 94%, which we believe is 
indicative of strong client satisfaction with our solutions and the nature of 
our long-term strategic client relationships. With our continued focus on 
innovation and thought leadership, we believe we have a significant opportunity
to both expand our engagements within our existing client base and to increase
the total number of healthcare organizations we serve.

Healthcare providers increasingly recognize that patient-centric strategies can
improve their performance from a clinical, safety, operational, financial and 
branding perspective. Our clients often cite moving their organization to a 
"patient-centric culture" as a top priority. We believe that we are 
well-positioned to benefit from our clients' shift in strategic focus, which is
a function of numerous trends in the healthcare industry.

Our solutions focus on providing our clients with technology-based solutions to
support the transition toward patient-centric care. Through our focus on the
patient experience, we assist our clients in their effort to improve care 
coordination, adopt performance transparency, build and enhance their brand
position and, ultimately, reduce patient suffering. In 2013, we introduced a
method of technology-based data aggregation, which we refer to as Census-Based
Surveying, to allow our clients to more efficiently capture the voice of every
patient. This method expands on traditional data collection methods through 
electronic means and organizes the data within our proprietary platform. 
Offering convenience and flexibility to patients as well as a common data 
structure for analysis, this innovative approach has resulted in significantly
greater data collection and more detailed, reliable insights, thereby 
accelerating related performance improvement cycles. In addition, more 
comprehensive data has enabled healthcare providers to increase transparency,
offering relevant, statistically valid performance information online directly
to consumers.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which relate to
      future, not past, events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The
      forward-looking statements, which address the Company's expected
      business and financial performance and financial condition, among other
      matters, contain words such as: “believe,” “could,” “opportunities,”
      “continue,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” or “would” and other words and
      terms of similar meaning.
    

      Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to
      different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about expected income;
      earnings; revenues; and growth. Although the Company believes the
      expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon
      reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that the expectations
      will be attained or that any deviation will not be material. Readers are
      cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
      statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.
    

      Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these
      forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the
      following:
    


        Because our clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry, our
        revenue and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in
        regulations, a business downturn or consolidation in the healthcare
        industry.
      

        If our clients do not continue to purchase our products and solutions,
        or we are unable to attract new clients, our business and operating
        results could be materially and adversely affected.
      

        The loss of several of our large clients or a significant reduction in
        business from such clients would adversely affect our operating
        results.
      

        We may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth.
      

        We may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which
        could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position
        in the industry.
      

        We may not be able to develop new products and solutions, or
        enhancements to our existing products and solutions, or be able to
        achieve widespread acceptance of new products or solutions.
      

        Technological developments could render our products and solutions
        obsolete or uncompetitive.
      

        We may be unable to effectively identify, complete or integrate the
        operations of future acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborative
        arrangements or other growth investments.
      

        We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth
        effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our
        business, financial condition, results of operations and growth
        prospects.
      

        We operate in an increasingly competitive market, which could
        adversely affect our revenue and market share.
      

        If we fail to promote and maintain awareness of our brand in a
        cost-effective manner, our business might suffer.
      

        We may not be able to maintain our certification to conduct CMS
        mandated surveys, and this could adversely affect our business.
      

        We depend on our senior management, and we may be materially harmed if
        we lose any member of our senior management.
      

        Data security and integrity are critically important to our business,
        and actual or attempted breaches of security, unauthorized disclosure
        of information, denial of service attacks or the perception that
        personal and/or other sensitive or confidential information in our
        possession is not secure, could result in a material loss of business,
        substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.
      

        Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we
        experience business interruptions, errors or failure in connection
        with our or third-party information technology and communication
        systems and other software and hardware products used in connection
        with our business.
      

        We may be liable to our clients and may lose clients if we are unable
        to collect and maintain client data or if we lose client data.
      

        Protection of our intellectual property may be difficult and costly,
        and our inability to protect our intellectual property could reduce
        the value of our products and solutions.
      

        The agreements governing our 2015 Credit Agreement impose significant
        operating and financial restrictions on our company and our
        subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business
        opportunities, and we have pledged substantially all of our assets to
        secure indebtedness under our 2015 Credit Agreement.
      

        Our internal control over financial reporting does not currently meet
        the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
      


      A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be
      found in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports
      on Form 10-Q and its Registration Statement on Form S-1 and the
      accompanying prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission on May 22, 2015. These or other uncertainties may cause the
      Company’s actual future results to be materially different than those
      expressed in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no
      obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest
      expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, with further
      adjustments to add back (i) items that were terminated in connection
      with the IPO, (ii) non-cash charges, (iii) non-recurring items that are
      not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the business
      and (iv) items that are solely related to changes in our capital
      structure, and therefore are not indicative of the underlying operating
      performance of the business. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as
      net income adjusted for non-cash and other non-recurring items.
      Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (i) to compare
      our operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate
      incentive compensation for our employees, (iii) for planning purposes,
      including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget, (iv)
      to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational
      strategies and (v) to assess compliance with various metrics associated
      with the agreements governing our indebtedness. We also believe that
      Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are useful to investors in
      assessing our financial performance because these measures are similar
      to the metrics used by investors and other interested parties when
      comparing companies in our industry that have different capital
      structures, debt levels and/or income tax rates. Accordingly, we believe
      that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provide useful information
      to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating
      performance in the same manner as our management. Adjusted EBITDA and
      Adjusted Net Income are not determined in accordance with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and should not be considered in
      isolation or as an alternative to net income, income from operations,
      net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or
      other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial
      performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP.
