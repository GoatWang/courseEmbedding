The Douglas Dynamics company and family of brands share a long and storied history over the past seven decades. As the Company has evolved, there are several consistent hallmarks through every incarnation of the business - the commitment to innovation, market leadership, quality and service.
Outlined below are selected highlights from our history that help illustrate the Company's evolution:

Fisher Engineering holds the distinction of being Douglas Dynamics' oldest brand.
Founded by Dean L. Fisher in Rockland, Maine in 1948, Fisher originally manufactured snowplows designed for Willy's Jeep vehicles, the iconic pre-cursor to the Jeep brand owned by GM today.
Nearly 70 years after its inception, Fisher stands as the market-leading brand for snow and ice control management in New England and on the East Coast.
Originally known as Western Welding and Manufacturing, Western Products was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1943.
In 1950, Douglas Seaman purchased the Company, which at that time concentrated on small, one-off welding jobs for large manufacturers before later focusing on manufacturing snow and ice equipment.
As the demand for suburban areas, light trucks and snowplows continued to grow Western Products' sales doubled between 1961 and 1968.
In 1977, Douglas Seaman created Douglas Dynamics, which became the parent company for Western Welding & Manufacturing.
Fisher Engineering joined Douglas Dynamics in 1984, uniting the two premier brands in the industry.
Seeing an opportunity to be part of an important advancement in the snowplow industry, Douglas Dynamics acquired the Blizzard Corporation in 2005, gaining access to industry-changing patents, including the revolutionary "adjustable-wing snowplow" that quickly developed a loyal following.
Douglas Dynamics successfully completed an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2010 and today trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PLOW" (NYSE:PLOW).
Around the same time that Douglas Dynamics was being founded in 1977, another company, TrynEx International, was developing a comprehensive line of highly regarded ice control equipment, under the SnowEx brand.
TrynEx International grew over the next 35 years and became a leader in salt spreaders for light trucks and expanded its products to include turf application equipment (TurfEx) and industrial attachment products (SweepEx). In 2013, Douglas Dynamics added TrynEx International to its family of brands.
Given its leading market position in the commercial snow and ice control market, the Company chose to diversify its offering and expand into the municipal snow and ice control market with the acquisition of Henderson Products just one year later.
Henderson Products is the leading North American manufacturer of customized, turnkey snow and ice control solutions for heavy-duty trucks focused on state DOT's, counties, and municipalities.
Following the success of its earlier acquisitions, Douglas Dynamics purchased Dejana Truck & Utility Equipment in July 2016 as part of its strategy to diversify its business outside of snow and ice control.
A strong brand in the truck equipment industry, over the past 59 years, Dejana has grown to become the premier upfitter of commercial work vehicles in the Eastern U.S. In addition, Dejana has become a leading specialized manufacturer of storage solutions for trucks and vans and cable pulling equipment.
Today, Douglas Dynamics' products are manufactured across the Midwest and Eastern seaboard and are sold throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The company employs approximately 1,700 people and has a market capitalization of approximately $700 million.

Product Description▼▲
Joy is a theme that sounds in the words and in the very lives of Brother Francis and Sister Clare. Their joy flowed from a determination to live the gospel simply and with full hearts. And their joy flamed up in the hearts of disciples by the thousands and still burns today. Francis, the poor brother of Assisi, lived in mystical harmony with the natural world. He prayed to be an instrument of peace, yet he understood suffering, especially the suffering of Christ, which left its marks on his body. Clare DiFavarone, a follower of Francis, founded a community of sisters whose descendants today work and worship in all parts of the world. This volume offers a sample of their writings, which still pulse with faith and joy.
