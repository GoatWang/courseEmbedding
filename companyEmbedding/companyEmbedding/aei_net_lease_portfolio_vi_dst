What is a Triple Net Lease?


The terms “Triple Net Lease”, Triple Net Leased “Triple-Net,” “NNN,” “Net Lease,” “Net-Net- Net” are
interchangeable. The definition of a Triple Net Lease (NNN) requires the tenant to pay all insurance, maintenance,
and taxes. The tenant is responsible for all normal expenses of ownership, leaving the owner free of day-to- day
management responsibility.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.

NNN-1031 Investment Advantages


Here are a few benefits of an investment grade (defined as having a BBB- or better credit rating by at least one of the rating agencies) triple NNN investment property:


	
	1. Net leased properties can relieve owners from day-to- day management issues.

	2. Steady income-stream potential paid by an investment grade corporate tenant.

	3. A long-term lease to a corporate tenant with credit rating makes it easier to get a mortgage loan at favorable rates.

	4. NNN properties may have high residual values because they are most often built for retailers who have researched the market to find high density, middle income areas with attractive traffic patterns.




 Get 1031 List




Why Triple-Net- Leases should align tenant and landlord interest.


Many regional and national companies choose to lease their business property. Leasing the property gives the
occupying companies the ability to control their physical environment without the financial commitment of
ownership. By leasing the property, companies free up their corporate funds for business expansion and
improvement. A Triple-Net lease gives the companies control over the property they occupy without the capital
commitment of ownership.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




1031 Exchange NNN-DST Properties


Some Triple Net investment properties are available as a Tenancy in Common (DST) interest.  NNN-DST properties
can be single-tenant, industrial, or retail properties with long-term leases to corporate tenants, however it is not
uncommon to find Triple Net Lease, NNN investment multi-tenant office property.

A potential investor could perhaps exchange into a DST 1031 exchange triple net property that requires little day-to-
day involvement by the investor. These undivided fractional interests provide an alternative to sole ownership of real
estate by allowing taxpayers to purchase interests in larger, commercial quality properties that are professionally
managed.




Sole Ownership NNN vs. Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST)


Since the mid-1990s, 1031 exchange investors have reinvested their equity into Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment properties structured as Tenancy-in- Common (DST). If you are an accredited and pre-qualified investor searching for a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property you may consider the following potential advantages of investing in a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property owned Delaware Statutory Trusts: (see 1031 Tenant in Common Pitfalls)


1. Selection of qualified 1031 exchange (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties. A limited variety of Tenancy-in- Common (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties usually exist for sale in different asset classes and geographical locations.

	2. Diversification. There is always risk, but net proceeds may be split among several (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties and thus invested in several different markets and asset classes, depending on an exchangers equity/debt requirements and the limited number of DST properties available during the Exchangers identification period.

	3. Locating Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) replacement properties. A real estate company typically locates the DST 1031 exchange NNN property, conducts it’s own due diligence research, arranges for the financing, manages the acquisition of the new investment property, sets up the Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) program, and provides the new owners with a management contract with a property management company (affiliated often) to manage the property on a day to day basis.

	4. The exchanger can potentially invest in higher -quality Triple Net Lease (NNN) institutional properties than if you were to invest as an individual.

	Large institutional properties could potentially benefit by having access to more competitive lenders, institutional buyers, and a stronger, more stable tenants base.

	5. The exchanger may benefit from non-recourse debt.

	Investors assume institutional grade, pre-arranged, non-recourse (no personal guarantee) financing. DST-1031 properties are sometimes available that have no debt, or up to a range of 75% leverage. (Note there are usually certain carve out provisions wherein DST owners could be personally liable.

	6. Exchangers may often match or exceed your exchange equity/debt requirements.

	Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) investments offer Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment opportunities ranging from as little as 100K equity up to several million dollars.




Triple Net Lease & DST Master Lease


MASTER LEASE STRUCTURE IN DST SECTION 1031 REPLACEMENT PROPERTY PROGRAMS


1031 Sponsors may offer Delaware Statutory Trusts properties on a Triple Net Master Lease structure to 1031 exchange investors with a Master Lease in place.	
	


WHAT IS A Triple Net (NNN) MASTER LEASE?


In a Master Lease structure, a single entity leases the entire property from the owners in return for a stipulated rent. The owners of the property only have one tenant per the master lease, the “Master Lessee.” The Master Lessee is responsible for the management, maintenance, repairs, leasing, taxes, assessments, and insurance. Most commonly referred to as a “triple net” lease, the structure requires that the owners of the property receive their rent completely and on time from the Master Lessee.

Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.

NNN PROPERTIES
	 








   NNN PROPERTIES
Tenant Credit Ratings



What are NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a 10 to 25 year term.  NNN Properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all, if not most of the expenses. The investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement.
Tenants in NNN Properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in.  Qualitatively NNN Properties have either credit or non credit tenants.  The most desirable (least risk) NNN Properties have investment grade (rated BBB- and better) credit tenants.

Non credit tenant NNN Properties have tenants that are not credit rated.  These tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated.  Some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books.  Click Tenant Ratings for list of tenants for NNN Properties.
Who Buys NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility.  The alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or REIT or invest in fractional ownership Tenant in Common properties.

A major advantage of 100% direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a 1031 exchange when the property is sold.  For many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in NNN Properties is offset by the lack of volatility NNN Properties offer when compared to a securitized investment.   Investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in NNN Properties.
How are NNN Properties Valued?
NNN Properties typically are valued using their Capitalization Rate also referred to as Cap Rate. NNN Properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk. Generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the Net Operating Income (NOI) for NNN Properties.

NOI is income less all expenses before debt service. The Cap Rate is the NOI divided by the purchase price for NNN Properties. Conversely the NOI divided by the Cap Rate will equal the purchase or selling price.
Example of Cap Rates for NNN Properties:
NOI = $100,000/10%=$1,000,000 Purchase or Selling Price
NOI = $100,000/$1,000,000=10% Cap Rate
How are Cap Rates Determined for NNN Properties?
Some of the major considerations when calculating Cap Rates for NNN Properties are:

 The credit worthiness of the tenant.
 The length of the lease, typically 10 to 25 years.
 The type of lease, triple net (NNN) or double net (NN). See below for definition.
 Type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent.
 Cost of financing
 Strength of the demographics of the property location
 Nature of the improvements. Are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting?
 Age and condition of the improvements
The more positive the above factors for NNN Properties, the lower the Cap Rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream. Conversely if the above factors for NNN Properties are weak the Cap Rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment.

It is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low Cap Rate NNN Properties are  not necessary a lower risk investment, they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced.  Astute investors seek NNN Properties that are mispriced in their favor, namely a higher Cap Rate for a property that has lower risk factors.
What is Build-to-Suit?
In a build-to-suit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a Net Lease.  The Net Lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project.  This arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost.

The Net Lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term, making the tenant's after-tax cost less than with alternative forms of asset-based financing.
What is a Ground Lease?
A ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements (building) from the ownership of the underlying fee (ground). Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service.
  Any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant.  In some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements.

On unsubordinated ground lease, no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land. Instead, the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements.  There is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease.
Many investors favor ground leases because they don't need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease.  When the Net Lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements.
Tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenant's cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs.  A long term Net Lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes.
Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases and include set rent escalations, foreclosure rights and reversionary right (improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease).
What is a Sale Leaseback?
A Real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a Net Lease.  The seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business.  
Real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business.

A long term Net Lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes Some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well.
Types Net Leases
NNN Properties are generally categorized as either true triple net (NNN) or double net (NN).  The distinction between NNN and NN leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions.
Absolute Triple Net (NNN)
The tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance, repairs, taxes and replacement for the entire property, without limitation. The owners pay the mortgage only. This is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing NNN Properties.
Bond Lease (NNN)
A bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple NNN lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property (i.e. Even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings).  
Double Net Lease  (NN)
Similar to NNN leases but with additional owner responsibilities. The owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof, foundation, load-bearing walls and parking.  Leases will vary so they should be carefully read.
Net Lease Alternative
For investors considering NNN Properties but who would like to invest less capital (cash) and still have little to no management responsibilities Fractional Ownership can be a good option to consider.
Advantages of Fractional Properties are the lower minimum investment (starting at $100,000), greater diversification, prepackaged financing (if any) and due diligence material.  Unlike a stock, or bond Fractional Ownership can qualify for 1031 and 1033 exchanges providing they follow IRS guidelines.

What is a Triple Net Lease?


The terms “Triple Net Lease”, Triple Net Leased “Triple-Net,” “NNN,” “Net Lease,” “Net-Net- Net” are
interchangeable. The definition of a Triple Net Lease (NNN) requires the tenant to pay all insurance, maintenance,
and taxes. The tenant is responsible for all normal expenses of ownership, leaving the owner free of day-to- day
management responsibility.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




 Get 1031 List




NNN-1031 Investment Advantages


Here are a few benefits of an investment grade (defined as having a BBB- or better credit rating by at least one of the rating agencies) triple NNN investment property:


	
	1. Net leased properties can relieve owners from day-to- day management issues.

	2. Steady income-stream potential paid by an investment grade corporate tenant.

	3. A long-term lease to a corporate tenant with credit rating makes it easier to get a mortgage loan at favorable rates.

	4. NNN properties may have high residual values because they are most often built for retailers who have researched the market to find high density, middle income areas with attractive traffic patterns.




 Get 1031 List




Why Triple-Net- Leases should align tenant and landlord interest.


Many regional and national companies choose to lease their business property. Leasing the property gives the
occupying companies the ability to control their physical environment without the financial commitment of
ownership. By leasing the property, companies free up their corporate funds for business expansion and
improvement. A Triple-Net lease gives the companies control over the property they occupy without the capital
commitment of ownership.


Most commercial property NNN leases are often between 10-25 years and include cost-of- living rent increases.
Rental payment continues for the full term of a NNN lease. This makes the credit rating of the tenant very important.




1031 Exchange NNN-DST Properties


Some Triple Net investment properties are available as a Tenancy in Common (DST) interest.  NNN-DST properties
can be single-tenant, industrial, or retail properties with long-term leases to corporate tenants, however it is not
uncommon to find Triple Net Lease, NNN investment multi-tenant office property.

A potential investor could perhaps exchange into a DST 1031 exchange triple net property that requires little day-to-
day involvement by the investor. These undivided fractional interests provide an alternative to sole ownership of real
estate by allowing taxpayers to purchase interests in larger, commercial quality properties that are professionally
managed.




Sole Ownership NNN vs. Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST)


Since the mid-1990s, 1031 exchange investors have reinvested their equity into Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment properties structured as Tenancy-in- Common (DST). If you are an accredited and pre-qualified investor searching for a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property you may consider the following potential advantages of investing in a Triple Net Lease (NNN) property owned Delaware Statutory Trusts: (see 1031 Tenant in Common Pitfalls)


1. Selection of qualified 1031 exchange (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties. A limited variety of Tenancy-in- Common (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties usually exist for sale in different asset classes and geographical locations.

	2. Diversification. There is always risk, but net proceeds may be split among several (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) properties and thus invested in several different markets and asset classes, depending on an exchangers equity/debt requirements and the limited number of DST properties available during the Exchangers identification period.

	3. Locating Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) Triple Net Lease (NNN) replacement properties. A real estate company typically locates the DST 1031 exchange NNN property, conducts it’s own due diligence research, arranges for the financing, manages the acquisition of the new investment property, sets up the Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) program, and provides the new owners with a management contract with a property management company (affiliated often) to manage the property on a day to day basis.

	4. The exchanger can potentially invest in higher -quality Triple Net Lease (NNN) institutional properties than if you were to invest as an individual.

	Large institutional properties could potentially benefit by having access to more competitive lenders, institutional buyers, and a stronger, more stable tenants base.

	5. The exchanger may benefit from non-recourse debt.

	Investors assume institutional grade, pre-arranged, non-recourse (no personal guarantee) financing. DST-1031 properties are sometimes available that have no debt, or up to a range of 75% leverage. (Note there are usually certain carve out provisions wherein DST owners could be personally liable.

	6. Exchangers may often match or exceed your exchange equity/debt requirements.

	Delaware Statutory Trusts (DST) investments offer Triple Net Lease (NNN) investment opportunities ranging from as little as 100K equity up to several million dollars.




Triple Net Lease & DST Master Lease


MASTER LEASE STRUCTURE IN DST SECTION 1031 REPLACEMENT PROPERTY PROGRAMS


1031 Sponsors may offer Delaware Statutory Trusts properties on a Triple Net Master Lease structure to 1031 exchange investors with a Master Lease in place.	
	


WHAT IS A Triple Net (NNN) MASTER LEASE?


In a Master Lease structure, a single entity leases the entire property from the owners in return for a stipulated rent. The owners of the property only have one tenant per the master lease, the “Master Lessee.” The Master Lessee is responsible for the management, maintenance, repairs, leasing, taxes, assessments, and insurance. Most commonly referred to as a “triple net” lease, the structure requires that the owners of the property receive their rent completely and on time from the Master Lessee.

The Value of Property Ratings

The Property Vault® rating system quantifies key drivers to value to quickly identify and match the best properties to investor’s unique needs. Hundreds of properties are rated each week to identify both their short and long term strengths and weaknesses. Ratings are based in-depth analysis of stability of cash flows, potential appreciation, demographic trends, supply & demand studies, local economic conditions, traffic patterns, tenant credit, lease terms, pricing, cap rate, nature of improvements and other key value drivers.
The ratings and property characteristics are then matched to each investor’s risk tolerance and objectives and needs. Email and text message notices are automatically sent to investors giving them the ability to quickly respond to their desired property match. Objective analytic reports and data are supplied for all rated properties. Key drivers to value can be easily compared using the Property Vault® “Compare Favorites” feature to assist investors in making their final investment decision.

Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.

NNN PROPERTIES
	 








   NNN PROPERTIES
Tenant Credit Ratings



What are NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a 10 to 25 year term.  NNN Properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all, if not most of the expenses. The investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement.
Tenants in NNN Properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in.  Qualitatively NNN Properties have either credit or non credit tenants.  The most desirable (least risk) NNN Properties have investment grade (rated BBB- and better) credit tenants.

Non credit tenant NNN Properties have tenants that are not credit rated.  These tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated.  Some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books.  Click Tenant Ratings for list of tenants for NNN Properties.
Who Buys NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility.  The alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or REIT or invest in fractional ownership Tenant in Common properties.

A major advantage of 100% direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a 1031 exchange when the property is sold.  For many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in NNN Properties is offset by the lack of volatility NNN Properties offer when compared to a securitized investment.   Investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in NNN Properties.
How are NNN Properties Valued?
NNN Properties typically are valued using their Capitalization Rate also referred to as Cap Rate. NNN Properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk. Generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the Net Operating Income (NOI) for NNN Properties.

NOI is income less all expenses before debt service. The Cap Rate is the NOI divided by the purchase price for NNN Properties. Conversely the NOI divided by the Cap Rate will equal the purchase or selling price.
Example of Cap Rates for NNN Properties:
NOI = $100,000/10%=$1,000,000 Purchase or Selling Price
NOI = $100,000/$1,000,000=10% Cap Rate
How are Cap Rates Determined for NNN Properties?
Some of the major considerations when calculating Cap Rates for NNN Properties are:

 The credit worthiness of the tenant.
 The length of the lease, typically 10 to 25 years.
 The type of lease, triple net (NNN) or double net (NN). See below for definition.
 Type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent.
 Cost of financing
 Strength of the demographics of the property location
 Nature of the improvements. Are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting?
 Age and condition of the improvements
The more positive the above factors for NNN Properties, the lower the Cap Rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream. Conversely if the above factors for NNN Properties are weak the Cap Rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment.

It is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low Cap Rate NNN Properties are  not necessary a lower risk investment, they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced.  Astute investors seek NNN Properties that are mispriced in their favor, namely a higher Cap Rate for a property that has lower risk factors.
What is Build-to-Suit?
In a build-to-suit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a Net Lease.  The Net Lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project.  This arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost.

The Net Lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term, making the tenant's after-tax cost less than with alternative forms of asset-based financing.
What is a Ground Lease?
A ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements (building) from the ownership of the underlying fee (ground). Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service.
  Any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant.  In some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements.

On unsubordinated ground lease, no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land. Instead, the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements.  There is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease.
Many investors favor ground leases because they don't need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease.  When the Net Lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements.
Tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenant's cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs.  A long term Net Lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes.
Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases and include set rent escalations, foreclosure rights and reversionary right (improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease).
What is a Sale Leaseback?
A Real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a Net Lease.  The seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business.  
Real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business.

A long term Net Lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes Some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well.
Types Net Leases
NNN Properties are generally categorized as either true triple net (NNN) or double net (NN).  The distinction between NNN and NN leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions.
Absolute Triple Net (NNN)
The tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance, repairs, taxes and replacement for the entire property, without limitation. The owners pay the mortgage only. This is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing NNN Properties.
Bond Lease (NNN)
A bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple NNN lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property (i.e. Even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings).  
Double Net Lease  (NN)
Similar to NNN leases but with additional owner responsibilities. The owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof, foundation, load-bearing walls and parking.  Leases will vary so they should be carefully read.
Net Lease Alternative
For investors considering NNN Properties but who would like to invest less capital (cash) and still have little to no management responsibilities Fractional Ownership can be a good option to consider.
Advantages of Fractional Properties are the lower minimum investment (starting at $100,000), greater diversification, prepackaged financing (if any) and due diligence material.  Unlike a stock, or bond Fractional Ownership can qualify for 1031 and 1033 exchanges providing they follow IRS guidelines.
