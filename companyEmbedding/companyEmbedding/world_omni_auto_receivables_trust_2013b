      Fitch Affirms Three Classes of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2013-B
    





September 15, 2015 03:48 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms three 
      outstanding classes of the World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2013-B. A 
      full list of rating action follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of the 
      transaction in this review can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables 
      Trust 2013-B -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical 
      R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2013-B
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.

A full list of rating action follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and CE, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.comApplicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884963Criteria for Servicing Continuity Risk in Structured Finance (pub. 17 Dec 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=875586Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=878723Related ResearchWorld Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2013-B -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=720620Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1010469Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1010469Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
