About us: Overview
About Us > Overview



In 1989, National Interstate Insurance opened its doors with the idea that customer service and personal attention mattered. That clients were more than mere claim numbers, they were people. With real lives and real questions and real needs.
We built National Interstate around our customers. And in the process, we built one of the leading specialty property and casualty insurance companies in the country.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of National Interstate Corporation (Nasdaq: NATL), National Interstate has more than 600 employees including our operations at Vanliner Insurance Company in Missouri – each of whom is committed to providing the highest level of personal service, the most efficient claims processing and the best products.


As a leading specialty property and casualty insurance holding company, we offer more than 30 different insurance products, including traditional insurance, innovative alternative risk transfer (ART) programs for commercial companies and insurance for specialty vehicle owners.
These products are available through a variety of distribution channels including independent agents and brokers, and affiliated agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are rated "A" (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company.
Headquartered in Richfield, Ohio, National Interstate also has operations in Kapolei, Hawaii, and Fenton, Missouri.






We offer customized insurance options for:


Passenger transportation companies
Truck transportation companies
