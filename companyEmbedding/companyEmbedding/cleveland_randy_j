Texas Oil & Gas Association

                    Texas Oil & Gas Association (TXOGA) is a statewide trade association with approximately 5,000 members representing every facet of the Texas oil and gas industry including small independents and major producers. TXOGA members account for over 90 percent of all crude oil and natural gas produced in Texas; they operate a vast majority of the State’s pipeline mileage and gas processing capacity; and they are responsible for a preponderance of the State’s refining capacity. Founded in 1919, TXOGA is the oldest and largest group in the State representing petroleum interests and continues to serve as the only organization which embraces all segments of the industry.
