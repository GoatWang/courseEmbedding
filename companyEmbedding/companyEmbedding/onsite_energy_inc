About OnSite EnergyOur teamWHAT DRIVES USSolar is a guaranteed energy source for future generationsWe strongly believe in the infinite resource of the sun and the reliability of solar electric systems for our daily energy needs. For over a decade we have been advocating solar electric technologies to Montanans through our own projects, community outreach, and legislative efforts. Our goal is to empower our local and regional community members to choose a future of clean, renewable solar energy for their homes and businesses that benefits our natural environment, our future generations, and our state’s economy.SOLAR FOR CONSERVATIon: HIGHLIGHTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSERVATION AND CLEAN ENERGYOne of the most important aspects of renewable energy is the departure from a dependence on heavily polluting traditional energy sources. Carbon-based emissions have a far-reaching negative impact on the quality of our air, water, and soil. The connection between conservation and clean energy begins here: by powering our lives with clean, renewable energy, we can take the next step in protecting the ecological integrity of the land and wildlife habitat that local conservation organizations have already worked so hard to protect from development and fragmentation. In that sense, choosing clean energy is choosing conservation. To support the inherent connection between the two, OnSite Energy has partnered with local conservation organizations by offering a promotion to their members where 1% of the total cost of their solar system will be returned to the organization they belong to as a donation.PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONSNot a member or supporter of these organizations? Visit their websites to join!If you want to learn more or become a participating organization, contact us directly.Our TeamPartner/Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Orion ThorntonOrion ThorntonPartner/Chief Technical Officer (CTO)Partner/Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Orion ThorntonOrion has been involved in the Montana solar energy industry for over ten years, both as an industry professional and advocate through education and community outreach. A Montana native who grew up off the grid, his interest in self-sufficiency and alternative energy sources started at a young age. His professional career in the solar industry began when he completed an A.A.S. degree in Photovoltaic (Solar Electric) Design and Installation from San Juan College in 2006 and was quickly hired by Independent Power Systems of Bozeman as a system designer/installer. In 2012 Orion founded OnSite Energy with a goal of providing premier solar electric services throughout the Northern Rockies. Having served on the board of directors for the Montana Renewable Energy Association (MREA) since 2014, he currently resides as the organization’s Vice President. As a contract instructor for Solar Energy International (SEI), Orion enjoys teaching the fundamentals of grid-tied and battery-based solar electric systems to students from all over the world. Orion resides in a net-zero energy home with his wife Megan and their two young children. Their home is powered by solar electricity, solar hot water, and wood heat. Dedicated to a lifetime of teaching, living, and working with renewable energy technologies, Orion is hopeful for Montana’s clean energy future…and works tirelessly to help make that future a reality.ORION’S CREDENTIALSA.A.S.

power systems there, many of which combined solar, wind and micro-hydro,
captured her imagination.
After graduating from MSU in 2006 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Sarah
worked for Independent Power Systems as an installer. Since then, she has held
sales and management positions, and spent a year designing large commercial PV
systems for Meridian Solar in Austin, Texas. Sarah joined the OnSite Energy

This project was certified as Yellowstone’s first LEED Platinum building, and the addition of a renewable energy component was integral in helping us to achieve this prestigious accolade. The folks at OnSite Energy were knowledgeable, helpful, and easy to work with throughout the process and we look forward to future projects to help reduce our impact in the world’s first national park.
