MEMORANDUM OF OPINION AND ORDER
[Resolving ECF Nos. 1-3, 11, 17, and 35]
BENITA Y. PEARSON, District Judge.
Pending are:
Defendant Time Warner Cable Midwest LLC's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 1-3),1 filed on May 31, 2016;
Defendants Baker Installations; JWC, LLC; JWCF, LP; Wade Baker; Fred Baker; Chad Baker; James Mazur; Christine Sheridan; and, Quinton Peagler's (the "Baker Defendants")2 Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (ECF No. 11), filed on June 15, 2016;
Defendants Broadband Express, LLC, David Dougherty, and William Pruett's (the "Broadband Defendants")3 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 17), filed on August 8, 2016; and,
Plaintiff Rebel Lee Brett's Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint Instanter (ECF No. 35), filed on October 19, 2016.
I. Background
In May 2016, Plaintiff filed a nine-paragraph Complaint (ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 12-14) against Time Warner, the Broadband Defendants, and the Baker Defendants4 in the Trumbull County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas, being Case No. 2016 CV 00810. While Plaintiff was employed by Broadband Express as a cable TV, internet and telephone installer, he applied for a job at Baker Installations where he had previously worked . ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 14, ¶ 5. The Broadband Defendants and Baker Defendants had contractual relations with Time Warner to provide cable installation services. ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 13, ¶ 2. Installers hired by them are subject to certain policies imposed by Time Warner, including a policy that provides that an installer may not perform installations for Time Warner's accounts if he or she has failed to complete an installation job or has a complaint on his or her record. ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 14, ¶ 4. The Broadband Defendants allegedly communicated to Time Warner that Plaintiff had missed performing the very cable installation services that the Broadband Defendants had been contracted to provide. ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 14, ¶ 8.
The Complaint (ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 12-14) asserts claims against all Defendants for (1) tortious interference with business relations and (2) tortious interference with contract related to his attempted employment with Baker Installations. Plaintiff alleges "[h]e was provisionally hired [by Baker Installations,] and on or about May 6, 2015, he notified his BROADBAND supervisor, Defendant William [Pruett]." ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 14, ¶ 5. "As a direct and proximate result of [the] negligent and reckless conduct of the Defendants, Plaintiff has not [been] able to secure a[] cable installation job and has been deprived of his livelihood." ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 14, ¶ 9. The Broadband Defendants, removed the case to this Court on June 8, 2016, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See Notice of Removal (ECF No. 1 at PageID #: 3-4, ¶¶ 8-21).
II. Plaintiff's Motion for Leave (ECF No. 35)
According to Plaintiff, "[t]his case was hastily filed on [May] 9, 2016, in the Trumbull County Common Pleas Court with the intent to file an amended complaint for service [on] the Defendants." ECF No. 35 at PageID #: 418; see also Affidavit of Irene Makridis (ECF No. 35-2) at PageID #: 433, ¶ 2.5 Plaintiff, however, did not properly move the Court for leave to file an Amended Complaint until October 19, 2016 (over five months later) when he filed the within motion. See Order (ECF No. 34). Plaintiff attached to his motion the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1). In the proposed amendment, Plaintiff seeks to correct typographical errors and incorrect grammar and syntax that appear in the Complaint (ECF No. 1-1 at PageID #: 12-14) and add three (3) claims: (1) defamation against all Defendants (Third Claim for Relief);
(2) promissory estoppel against the Baker Defendants only (Fourth Claim for Relief); and (3) "Against Public Policy," specifically violation of good faith and fair dealing, against the Baker Defendants only (Fifth Claim for Relief). ECF No. 35 at PageID #: 420-21. The Broadband Defendants and Baker Defendants oppose Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend. See ECF Nos. 37 and 38. The Court has been advised, having reviewed the record, the parties' briefs6 and the applicable law. The Court has also considered the oral arguments of counsel offered during the Telephonic Status Conference held on October 24, 2016. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) mandates that leave to amend shall be freely given "when justice so requires." As stated by the Supreme Court:
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc,—the leave sought should, as the rules require, be "freely given."
Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Brown v. Chapman, 814 F.3d 436, 442-43 (6th Cir. 2016). Under Rule 15(a), the court has discretion in allowing amendments. Robinson v. Mich. Consol. Gas Co., 918 F.2d 579, 591 (6th Cir. 1990) ("Decisions as to when justice requires amendment are left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.").
In reviewing Plaintiff's motion for leave, it is necessary to weave in additional facts. Plaintiff contends Broadband Express withheld the return of his Time Warner ID badge so that it could not be released to his prospective employer, Baker Installations, and thus Plaintiff could not be hired by Baker Installations. Plaintiff alleges that on May 7, 2015, he returned his equipment, including his ID badge, to Broadband Express. The badge had been issued to him by Time Warner. ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 428, ¶¶ 10-11. He also alleges that Broadband Express refused to return his badge to Time Warner, knowing that the return of the badge was necessary for Baker Installations to hire him. ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 429, ¶ 12. During the Telephonic Status Conference held on October 24, 2016, the Court was informed that Time Warner was not told that Plaintiff had not completed a job assigned to him by the Broadband Defendants. The Court was also advised that Plaintiff's ID badge was returned to Time Warner on May 15, 2015 and that Plaintiff was only ineligible (for hire by Baker Installations) to do installations for Time Warner for four (4) days.
A motion for leave to amend a complaint should not be granted where the proposed amended pleading would be futile. See, e.g., Midkiff v. Adams County Regional Water Dist., 409 F.3d 758, 767 (6th Cir. 2005). "A motion to amend is deemed futile if the proposed amendment `could not withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.'" DeBolt v. Cassens Transport Co., No. 4:11CV1227, 2012 WL 3497659, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 15, 2012) (Pearson, J.) (quoting Rose v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 417, 420 (6th Cir. 2000)). The Court concludes that filing the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) would be futile, as it still fails to state any legally cognizable claim against any Defendant.
A. Dougherty and Pruett
The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) still fails to state a claim against Dougherty and Pruett. Plaintiff has failed to identify any misconduct allegedly perpetrated by these defendants that ties them to any claim alleged by Plaintiff. See Unger v. City of Mentor, 387 Fed.Appx. 589, 592 (6th Cir. 2010) (affirming dismissal of claims against a defendant where the complaint lacked factual specificity, citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).
B. First Claim for Relief7
The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) is futile because it fails to state a claim for tortious interference with business relations. "The elements essential to recovery for a tortious interference with a business relationship are: (1) a business relationship; (2) the wrongdoer's knowledge thereof; (3) an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship; and (4) damages resulting therefrom." Wolf v. McCullough-Hyde Memorial Hosp., Inc., 67 Ohio App.3d 349, 355 (1990); see also Moore v. Rubin, No. 2001-T-0150, 2004 WL 2803237, at *3, ¶ 16 (Ohio App. 11th Dist. Sept. 17, 2004); Wauseon Plaza Ltd. Partnership v. Wauseon Hardware Co., 156 Ohio App.3d 575, 588, ¶ 57 (2004). "The main distinction between tortious interference with a contractual relationship and tortious interference with a business relationship is that interference with a business relationship includes intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, not yet reduced to a contract." Diamond Wine & Spirits, Inc. v. Dayton Heidelberg Distrib. Co., Inc., 148 Ohio App.3d 596, 604, ¶ 23 (citation omitted).
The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) does not set forth an allegation that Time Warner and the Broadband Defendants took any action with the intent of causing a breach in Plaintiff's relationship with Baker Installations. In fact, the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) neglects to include any facts whatsoever regarding the Broadband Defendants' interactions with Baker Installations. See Wright Safety Co. v. U.S. Bank, N.A., No. 24587, 2009 WL 4653550, at *7, ¶ 26 (Ohio App. 9th Dist. Dec. 9, 2009) (defendant's actions even if improper, did not amount to intentional interference with plaintiffs' relations with another institution when there were no allegations that defendant or its employees had any interactions with another institution). Plaintiff alleges that Time Warner and the Broadband Defendants "intentionally or recklessly and negligently interfered with Plaintiff's prospective relationship with Defendant Baker." ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 429, ¶ 14. This lone attempt by Plaintiff to salvage this claim fails because it is a mere recitation of an element of the cause of action, and cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009); see also, Wilkey v. Hull, 366 Fed.Appx. 634, 638 (6th Cir. 2010) (applying Ohio law, stating an allegation that a party interfered with certain unspecified business relationships "is just a legal conclusion. . . . Absent some factual allegation that [the tortfeasor's] actions ended or prevented a business relationship," a 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the alleged "interference must be intentional because Ohio does not recognize negligent interference with a business relationship." Diamond Wine & Spirits, 148 Ohio App.3d 596, 604, ¶ 23 (quoting Bauer v. Commercial Aluminum Cookware Co., 140 Ohio App.3d 193, 199 (2000)).
C. Second Claim for Relief8
The allegations in proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) also fail to carry Plaintiff's burden of pleading the essential elements of a tortious interference with contract claim. "In order to recover for a claim of intentional interference with a contract, one must prove (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the wrongdoer's knowledge of the contract, (3) the wrongdoer's intentional procurement of the contract's breach, (4) the lack of justification, and (5) resulting damages." Kenty v. Transamerica Premium Ins. Co., 72 Ohio St.3d 415 (1995), paragraph two of the syllabus. The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) fails to adequately allege the first, second, and third elements. It does not allege (1) the existence of an actual or prospective contract or (2) that a Defendant was aware of a contract between Plaintiff and any of the other Defendants or (3) facts that a Defendant intentionally interfered with Plaintiff's contract with either Time Warner or any of the Baker Defendants.
A denial of the motion for leave is also appropriate because Plaintiff has not alleged that the communications between the Broadband Defendants and Time Warner lacked privilege. "Statements between parties concerning a common business interest may be protected by a qualified privilege." Mills Van Lines, Inc. v. Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Servs., Nos. 95582, 95819, 2011 WL 3359966, at *3, ¶ 17 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. Aug. 4, 2011) (citing Evely v. Carlon Co., Div. of Indian Head, Inc., 4 Ohio St.3d 163, 165 (1983)); see also James v. Big Bear Stores Company, No. 93AP-325, 1994 WL 21751, at *3 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. Jan. 27, 1994) (affirming the trial court's finding that Big Bear was privileged to convey to ADT its desire not to have appellant work on Big Bear premises and summary judgment in favor of Big Bear on appellant's claim for tortious interference with his employment contract). A claim for tortious interference with business relations and/or contract occurs only when a defendant, without privilege to do so, "induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to enter into or continue" business relations or a contract or with another. A & B-Abell Elevator Co. v. Columbus/Cent. Ohio Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 73 Ohio St.3d 1, 14 (1995). "Ohio imposes the burden of proving lack of privilege or improper interference on the plaintiff." 1020 Bolivar, LLC v. Zarnas, 2012 Ohio Misc. LEXIS 146, at *2 (Ct. of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County Sept. 26, 2012) (citing Super Sulky, Inc. v. U.S. Trotting Ass'n, 174 F.3d 733, 741 (6th Cir. 1999)). "Once a defendant demonstrates the existence of the qualified privilege, a plaintiff can only prevail upon a showing of actual malice" in the communication. Mills Van Lines, 2011 WL 3359966, at *4, ¶ 19 (citing Hanley v. Riverside Methodist Hosp., 78 Ohio App.3d 73, 81 (1991)). The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) does not, and cannot meet this burden because the Broadband Defendants' communications to Time Warner are privileged and Plaintiff has not alleged actual malice to overcome the qualified common business interest privilege.
D. Third Claim for Relief
The proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) is also futile because it fails on its face to state a claim for defamation. In order to sustain a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must demonstrate: "(1) a false and defamatory statement; (2) about plaintiff; (3) published without privilege to a third party; (4) with fault of at least negligence on the part of the defendant; and (5) that was either defamatory per se or caused special harm to the plaintiff." Davis v. Jacobs, 126 Ohio App.3d 580, 582 (1998) (quoting Gosden v. Louis, 116 Ohio App.3d 195, 206 (1996)). Plaintiff has not met this burden in the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) in several ways.
First, Plaintiff does not identify "a false and defamatory statement" because he does not identify what "false information" that a Defendant allegedly submitted to an "information tracking system." See ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 430, ¶ 18. Second, Plaintiff does not identify who owns the "information tracking system" into which a Defendant allegedly submitted false information, and therefore has not adequately pleaded that any false and defamatory statement was actually published to a third party. Third, for the reasons set forth above in Section II.C., Plaintiff has failed to allege how or why any communications between the Defendants would not be covered by qualified privilege. Knox v. Neaton Auto Products Mfg., Inc., 375 F.3d 451, 460 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Hahn v. Kotten, 43 Ohio St.2d 237, 243 (1975)). Fourth, Plaintiff has not alleged how any such defamation caused him any harm. Plaintiff alleges in ¶ 12 of the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) that he was denied employment at Baker Installations because of his Time Warner ID badge not returned — he does not allege that he was denied employment because of any statement made by Time Warner or any of the Broadband Defendants. Thus, Plaintiff has not identified any harm he suffered as a result of the alleged defamation.
E. Fourth Claim for Relief
The allegations in the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) fail to carry Plaintiff's burden of pleading the essential elements of a promissory estoppel claim against the Baker Defendants. To establish such a claim, "a plaintiff must show that (1) the employer made a clear, unambiguous promise; (2) the plaintiff relied on that promise; (3) the reliance was justifiable; and (4) the reliance caused detriment to the plaintiff." O'Donnell v. Coulson, 40 F.Supp.2d 446, 455 (N.D. Ohio 1998) (Oliver, J.) (dismissing claim for promissory estoppel where the alleged promise was not clear and unambiguous). Plaintiff alleges in ¶ 9 of the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) that "[h]e interviewed with Defendants Quinton Peagler and Christine Sheridan who promised to hire him at Defendant Baker — pending approval from Defendant Time Warner" (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not secure the cable installation job with Baker Installations. As a matter of Ohio law, the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) fails to adequately allege the first element, and accordingly the Fourth Claim for Relief fails "to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). As for this first prong, according to Ohio law, a promissory estoppel claim cannot be premised on a conditional promise when the condition at issue never occurs. See, e.g., Cincinnati Fluid Power, Inc. v. Rexnord, Inc., 797 F.2d 1386, 1393 (6th Cir. 1986) ("conditional promise can serve as basis of estoppel claim only if condition is satisfied prior to action taken in reliance on that promise" (citation omitted)); see also, e.g., Andersons, Inc. v. Consol, Inc., 185 F.Supp.2d 833, 840 (N.D. Ohio 2001) (Carr, J.) ("To be `clear and unambiguous,' the promise cannot be conditional." (citing cases)). Given that the Fourth Claim for Relief is premised on a conditional promise and the condition at issue never occurred, the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) also fails to adequately allege the second element. Cincinnati Fluid Power, 797 F.2d at 1393 ("conditional promise alleged was not a reasonable basis for reliance and thus not a proper basis for estoppel" (citation omitted)).
Assuming arguendo that the purported promise of Baker Installations was not conditional, the Fourth Claim for Relief would nevertheless fail for the additional reason that it is precluded by well-established Ohio law governing such claims in the context of at-will employment relationships. Because Ohio is an at-will employment state, a promissory estoppel claim in such cases must be premised on "a specific promise of continued employment." Godfrey v. Mastec, Inc., Case No. 1:15-cv-409, 2015 WL 7570209, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 25, 2015) (dismissing promissory estoppel claim). Plaintiff alleges "[t]he Baker Defendants, and specifically Defendant Quentin Peagler and Defendant Christine Sheridan, promised Plaintiff new employment with improved conditions if he returned and worked for Defendant Baker." ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 430, ¶ 20. An offer for at-will employment by the Baker Defendants under the facts alleged by Plaintiff precludes a claim for promissory estoppel because it falls far short of a specific promise of continued employment.
F. Fifth Claim for Relief
The Fifth Claim for Relief in the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) is futile. This claim is styled as "Against Public Policy" and attempts to assert a claim against the Baker Defendants on the grounds that Defendants Quentin Peagler and Christine Sheridan allegedly "never told Plaintiff that Defendant Time Warner had not received his badge from Defendant Broadband Express — but told him instead that Defendant Time Warner Cable would not hire him because of an incomplete installation job report by Defendant Broadband." ECF No. 35-1 at PageID #: 431, ¶ 24. But that allegation is to be read in conjunction with ¶ 12 of the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1). Assuming that Plaintiff's allegation that "the Broadband Defendants reported to Defendant Time Warner that Plaintiff had not completed installation jobs he was assigned to" is true,9 Peagler and Sheridan were simply communicating the reasons they had been provided by Time Warner — nothing more.
Paragraph 25 and 26 of the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) allege the Baker Defendants "related this information knowing that it is false, knowing that it will damage Plaintiff, and acted contrary to a policy of good faith and fair dealings in the State of Ohio", and that "conduct was willful and wanton, with intent to injure plaintiff who reasonably relied on their honesty and good faith." However, Plaintiff provides no additional allegations in the proposed Amended Complaint (ECF No. 35-1) as to how or why the statements allegedly made by Peagler and Sheridan to Plaintiff were "false;" how or why those statements were made with "knowledge" of their falsity; how those statements were in any way material; what action or actions Plaintiff allegedly took "in reliance" on those statements; or how any such "reliance" could have been justified or reasonable.
For these reasons and those that have been articulated in the memoranda of points and authorities on which the Broadband Defendants and Baker Defendants rely in opposition to the motion (ECF Nos. 37 and 38), Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint Instanter (ECF No. 35) is denied.
III. Standards of Review for Defendants' Motions
A. Dismissal
In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must take all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and construe those allegations in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (citations omitted). A cause of action fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted when it lacks "plausibility in th[e] complaint." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 564. A pleading must contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 677-78 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Plaintiff is not required to include detailed factual allegations, but must provide more than "an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Id. at 678. A pleading that offers "labels and conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders "naked assertion[s]" devoid of "further factual enhancement." Id. at 557. It must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The plausibility standard is not akin to a "probability requirement," but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. Where a complaint pleads facts that are "merely consistent with" a defendant's liability, it "stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief.'" Id. at 557 (brackets omitted). "[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not `show[n]'—`that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Rule 8(a)(2)). The Court "need not accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation or an unwarranted factual inference." Handy-Clay v. City of Memphis, Tenn., 695 F.3d 531, 539 (6th Cir. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
B. Judgment on the Pleadings
A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is reviewed under the same standard applicable to a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Tucker v. Middleburg-Legacy Place, 539 F.3d 545, 549 (6th Cir. 2008). The Court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, accept all factual allegations as true, and make reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F.3d 430, 434 (6th Cir. 2008); In re Sofamor Danek Group, Inc., 123 F.3d 394, 400 (6th Cir. 1997). The complaint must "give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Nader v. Blackwell, 545 F.3d 459, 470 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)). A motion brought pursuant to Rule 12(c) is appropriately granted "when no material issue of fact exists and the party making the motion is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Winget, 510 F.3d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Paskvan v. City of Cleveland Civil Serv. Comm'n, 946 F.2d 1233, 1235 (6th Cir. 1991)).
IV. Time Warner's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 1-3)
For the reasons set forth above in Section II and those that have been articulated in the memorandum of points and authorities on which Time Warner relies in support of the motion, Defendant Time Warner Cable Midwest LLC's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 1-3) is granted without opposition.
V. Baker Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11)
For the reasons set forth above in Section II and those that have been articulated in the memorandum of the points and authorities on which the Baker Defendants rely in support of the motion, Defendants Baker Installations; JWC, LLC; JWCF, LP; Wade Baker; Fred Baker; Chad Baker; James Mazur; Christine Sheridan; and, Quinton Peagler's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (ECF No. 11) is granted without opposition.
VI. Broadband Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 17)
For the reasons set forth above in Section II and those that have been articulated in the memorandum of points and authorities on which the Broadband Defendants rely in support of the motion, Defendants Broadband Express, LLC, David Dougherty, and William Pruett's (the "Broadband Defendants") Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 17) is granted without opposition.
VII.
Defendant Time Warner Cable Midwest LLC's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 1-3) is granted.
Defendants Baker Installations; JWC, LLC; JWCF, LP; Wade Baker; Fred Baker; Chad Baker; James Mazur; Christine Sheridan; and, Quinton Peagler's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (ECF No. 11) is granted.
Defendants Broadband Express, LLC, David Dougherty, and William Pruett's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 17) is granted.
Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint Instanter (ECF No. 35) is denied.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

What is a Digital Adapter?





A Digital Adapter is a small converter that allows viewing of digital TV services on your television. An adapter is about the size of a deck of cards.
If you connect your TV set directly from the wall with a cable wire, you will need equipment, such as a Digital Adapter, for every TV in your home.
Digital Adapters are no longer available.  Customers who have them can contact us with questions.

Billing & Payments





















                    Ask TWC - Virtual Assistant
                







 Go



















Find the answers to questions our customers ask most often, such as:








Can I purchase my own internet modem?








How do I get a new remote control?








How do I make a payment?








What if I have problems logging in?








Where can I replace or return my TWC Internet hardware?






















Understand your bill and payment options





We’ve designed the billing statement with you in mind. The sample bill provided is designed to explain the information contained within your monthly billing statement.










Reasons your bill may change






There are various reasons why your bill may be more (or less) than usual:






We often offer promotional pricing when you sign up for services, and that pricing is available only for a limited time (e.g. $49.99 per month for 12 months). Once a discount expires, there will be an increase to either a new promotional rate or to retail rates. Note: You’ll be notified on your bill when pricing changes.
If you’ve recently changed your service, pro-rated charges may be shown on your bill. Pro-rated charges are partial-month charges and ensure that you will be charged only for the number of days the services were used for that billing period.
If your service was just installed, you might see one-time fees included for installation or activation of services.
You or someone in your household may have purchased Pay-Per-View or On Demand programming. Please review your bill to view a list of the movies titles and live events and the date on which they were purchased.










Ways to pay your bill






You can pay your bill through a variety of options, including online through My Account or the My TWC® App, in person, by phone, by mail or via live chat on a computer.
Note: The following forms of payment are accepted regardless of how you choose to pay your bill:

Credit cards: American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa

Debit cards: MasterCard and Visa
 

Additional forms of eligible payment vary by option.

Time Warner Cable (TWC) was an American cable television company. Prior to its purchase by Charter Communications in 2016, it was ranked the second largest cable company in the United States by revenue behind only Comcast, operating in 29 states.[1] Its corporate headquarters were located in the Time Warner Center in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[2] with other corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Herndon, Virginia.[3]
It was controlled by Warner Communications, then by Time Warner (the film and television production company and cable channel operator). That company spun off the cable operations in March 2009 as part of a larger restructuring. From 2009 to 2016, Time Warner Cable was an entirely independent company, continuing to use the Time Warner name under license from its former parent (including the "Road Runner" name for its Internet service, now Spectrum Internet).
In 2014, the company was the subject of a proposed purchase by Comcast Corporation, valued at $45.2 billion; however, following opposition to the deal by various groups, along with plans by the U.S. government to try to block the merger, Comcast called off the deal in April 2015. On May 26, 2015, Charter Communications announced that it would acquire Time Warner Cable for $78.7 billion, along with Bright House Networks in a separate $10.1 billion deal, pending regulatory approval.[4]
The purchase was completed on May 18, 2016; Charter had continued to do business as Time Warner Cable in its former markets, but has now re-branded these operations under the Spectrum brand in most markets.[5]

History[edit]
Time Warner Cable was formed in 1992 by the merger of Time Inc.'s cable television company, American Television and Communications Corp. (service areas that had belonged to that company went under the Time Warner Communications name; since the 1990s, areas that had used that name have either been renamed to Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks, or have been given to other cable providers), and Warner Cable, a division of Warner Communications, as a result of a merger to form Time Warner; for the two years after the merger, the companies operated separately but under the umbrella name "Time Warner Cable Group" (primarily due to 18% of ATC having been publicly owned at the time); they merged into one entity in 1992. It also includes the remnants of the defunct QUBE interactive TV service. In 1995, the company launched the Southern Tier On-Line Community, a cable modem service later known as Road Runner High Speed Online. That year, talks began that would later result in Warner's acquisition of Paragon Cable. Glenn Britt (1949–2014)[6][7] was the CEO from 2001 until December 2013.
Time Warner retained Time Warner Cable as a subsidiary until March 2009, when it was spun out as an independent company.[8] Prior to the spin-out, Time Warner had held an 84% stake in Time Warner Cable.[9] Non-Time Warner shareholders received 0.083670 shares for each share already owned. This move made Time Warner Cable the largest cable operator in the United States owned solely by a single class of shareholders (without supervoting stock).[10]
Time Warner Cable launched DVR service in the Houston area in 2004. (TWC's Houston-area cable systems are now owned by Comcast.) When first launched, it used Scientific-Atlanta set-top boxes with DVR.
In June 2009, Time Warner Cable unveiled a concept known as "TV Everywhere"—a means of allowing multi-platform access to live and on-demand content to content from television channels that is tied to a user's television subscription.[11][12]
Sale[edit]
Main article: Attempted purchase of Time Warner Cable by Comcast
It was first reported in October 2013 that Time Warner Cable was exploring a sale of the company, possibly to Charter Communications.[13] However, on November 22, 2013, reports surfaced that Comcast expressed interest in acquiring Time Warner Cable. Both companies were said to be placing bids for the company.[14] Charter reiterated its interest in purchasing Time Warner Cable and increased its bid on January 14, 2014. On February 12, 2014, it was reported that Comcast had reached a deal to acquire TWC in an overall deal valued at $45.2 billion, pending regulatory approval.[15]
The proposed merger was met with prominent opposition from various groups, showing concerns that the sheer size of the combined company would reduce competition and would give Comcast an unprecedented level of control over the United States' internet and television industries, increased leverage in the distribution of NBCUniversal content, hamper over-the-top services, and lead to higher prices for its services.[16][17][18][19] In April 2015, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the companies in a bid to halt the merger, primarily because the merged company would have controlled 57 percent of the nation's broadband capacity. On April 24, 2015, Comcast officially announced that it had called off the merger.[20][21]
On May 25, 2015, Bloomberg News reported that Charter was "near" a deal to acquire TWC for $195 a share.[22] Charter had been involved in the Comcast/TWC merger, as the companies planned to divest around 4 million subscribers to Charter in order to reduce the combined company's market share to an acceptable level.[23] The next day, Charter officially announced its intent to acquire Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion, and confirmed that it would also continue with its proposed, $10.1 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although due to the relatively smaller size of the companies and their media holdings, the deal was expected to face less resistance than the Comcast/TWC merger.[24]
The acquisition was completed on May 18, 2016. The Time Warner Cable brand was phased out in favor of Spectrum, the brand used by Charter to market its services.[25][5][26]
Residential services[edit]
As of second quarter 2009, there were 14.6 million basic cable subscribers, 8.8 million Digital cable subscribers, 8.7 million Road Runner residential subscribers, 2.5 million DVR subscribers,[27] and 4.5 million residential Digital Phone subscribers, which makes it the fifth-largest landline phone provider in the United States.[28]
Business services[edit]
As of 2013, Time Warner Cable's business division had the second largest business-facing enterprise by revenue (of cable providers who offer business services), with $1.7 billion in revenue as of the third quarter of 2013. Total revenue for 2012 was $1.9 billion.[29]
Cable Internet service[edit]
Main article: Spectrum Internet
Naming rights[edit]
Current[edit]
Arena[edit]
Spectrum Center, formerly Time Warner Cable Arena, is located in Charlotte, North Carolina, the home of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. In April 2008, the then-Bobcats reached a naming rights deal with Time Warner Cable, the Charlotte area's major cable television provider; the arena was named for the cable provider in exchange for the release of the team's television rights, which had been on the TWC co-owned Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television for its first season, which failed to find much cable coverage in the Charlotte market outside of Time Warner systems and went dark after a year, and then News 14 Carolina which was limited to only the North Carolina side of the market, until the arena naming rights deal was made. The team moved to the new Fox Sports South sub-feed Fox Sports Carolinas and SportSouth (now Fox Sports Southeast) with the 2008-09 season, allowing coverage through both the Carolinas.[30] Shortly after being acquired by Charter, the arena was renamed to Spectrum Center.
Former[edit]
Fox Cities Stadium[edit]
Main article: Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium
On March 9, 2007, Time Warner Cable, which provides service to the northeastern Wisconsin area, signed a 10-year naming rights deal. The field is home of the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, a local minor league baseball team of the Midwest League and affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers, based in Grand Chute, a suburb of Appleton. The team and Time Warner Cable mutually agreed to end the rights deal after the 2013 season, and the venue is now known as Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium, named for a local neurology practice.
Acquisitions[edit]
Adelphia[edit]
On July 31, 2007, Time Warner Cable and Comcast completed a deal to purchase practically all of Adelphia's assets for $17 billion.[31] Time Warner Cable gained 3.3 million of Adelphia's subscribers, a 29 percent increase, while Comcast gained almost 1.7 million subscribers. Adelphia stockholders received 16% of Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable went public effective February 13, 2007, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 1, 2007.[32]
In addition to Adelphia's coverage being divided up, Time Warner Cable and Comcast also agreed to exchange some of their own subscribers in order to consolidate key regions. An example of this is the Los Angeles market, which was mostly covered by Comcast and Adelphia (and some areas of the region already served by TWC), is now under Time Warner Cable. Philadelphia had been split between Time Warner and Comcast, with the majority of cable subscribers belonging to Comcast. Time Warner subscribers in Philadelphia were swapped with Comcast in early 2007. Similarly, the Houston area, which was under Time Warner, was swapped to Comcast, while the Dallas metro area was changed to Time Warner (RR).[33] In the Twin Cities, Minneapolis was Time Warner and Saint Paul was Comcast. That whole market is now Comcast.
NaviSite[edit]
Time Warner Cable purchased NaviSite (NAVI), a company providing cloud and hosting services, on February 1, 2011 for $230 million, roughly equating to $5.50 per share.[34]
Insight Communications[edit]
On August 13, 2011, Time Warner Cable announced its purchase of Insight Communications for $3 billion acquiring Insight's 760,000 subscribers nationwide. The merger was completed February 29, 2012, and as of June 2013 all of Insight Communications was absorbed into Time Warner Cable.[35]
DukeNet Communications[edit]
On October 7, 2013, Time Warner Cable announced that it has agreed to acquire DukeNet Communications LLC for $600 million. DukeNet provides data and high-capacity bandwidth services to wireless carrier, data center, government, and enterprise customers in the Southeast.[36]
Advance/Newhouse and Time Warner (Bright House Networks spin off)[edit]
Some of the regional cable system clusters operated by Time Warner Cable are owned by the Time Warner Entertainment – Advance/Newhouse Partnership (TWEAN). In 2002, Advance/Newhouse Communications, unhappy with some of the operating policies of Time Warner Cable in the AOL Time Warner era, forced a restructuring of the TWEAN partnership such that Advance/Newhouse would actively manage and operate a portion of the jointly owned cable systems equal to their percentage of equity. Under this arrangement, Advance/Newhouse enjoys the proceeds of their actively managed systems rather than simply a percentage of the partnership's total earnings. The majority of the affected systems are in the Tampa and Orlando markets under the Bright House Networks brand.
The value of this deal is that it allows Advance/Newhouse to more directly control their cable investments without having to completely unravel the TWEAN partnership, which does bring some benefits via Time Warner's development and purchasing clout.
The transactions proposed by Charter were approved, TWC and Bright House Networks have been absorbed into Charter.[24]
Venture with Sprint Nextel[edit]
In late 2005, TWC and several other cable companies formed a venture with Sprint Nextel. This joint venture enables TWC customers to receive a full suite of products, linking in-home and out-of-home entertainment, information, and communications services. All of this was included in the new "Triple Play on the Go", similar to the Triple Play[discuss] but an addition of new services through Sprint Nextel.
Controversies[edit]
Bandwidth metering[edit]
In Beaumont, Texas, during 2008, Time Warner Cable began testing tier-based metered data plans that effectively placed customers into a pricing hierarchy based on the amount of data that they used, [clarification needed].[37] In 2009, Time Warner Cable announced that additional cities including Rochester, New York will become additional test sites. In particular in Rochester groups have formed to stop TWC. Several groups including Stop TWC[38] and Stop The Cap[39] are currently working to oppose these efforts. On April 7, 2009, then US Congressman Eric Massa called on Time Warner to eliminate its broadband Internet cap.[40]
Signal intrusion and accidental transmission of pornography[edit]
On March 16, 2010, Time Warner Cable's transmission of their Kids on Demand and Kids Pre-School on Demand channels on systems in eastern North Carolina was interrupted by programming from the adult pay television channel Playboy TV for approximately two hours between 6:15 a.m. and 8:15 a.m./EDT, in which a group of nude women talked and posed in a sexually suggestive manner.[41] This accidental display affected Time Warner's digital cable subscribers in four towns in the system's eastern North Carolina cluster, while other areas displayed a black screen. A Time Warner spokesperson said in a statement to Raleigh CBS affiliate WRAL, "It was a technical malfunction that caused the wrong previews to be shown on our kids' on-demand channels. Unfortunately it hit at the worst possible time on the worst possible channels."[42] A Time Warner executive said normal monitoring procedures did not take effect because the glitch affected only a few areas. Customers were told to pay the small fee, and that their next bill would be reduced. [43]
