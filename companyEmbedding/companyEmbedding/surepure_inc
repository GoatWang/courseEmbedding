WHAT IS  UV?
Ultraviolet  processing involves the use of radiation from the ultraviolet region of the  electromagnetic spectrum for purposes of disinfection.  

                    Ultraviolet  covers a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and is considered to be  germicidal against micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, yeasts,  moulds and algae. Ultraviolet treatment is performed at low temperatures and is  classified as a non-thermal disinfection method. 



Typically,  the wavelength for UV processing ranges from 100 to 400 nm. The highest  germicidal effect is obtained between 250 and 270 nm. This range may be further  subdivided into:


UV-A (315 to 400 nm) normally responsible for  changes in human skin that lead to tanning; 
UV-B (280 to 315 nm) that can cause skin burning  and eventually lead to skin cancer;
UV-C (200 to 280 nm) called the germicidal range  since it effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, 
The vacuum UV range (100 to 200 nm) that can be  absorbed by almost all substances and thus can be transmitted only in a vacuum. 


SurePure  employs UV-C radiation at the germicidal wavelength of 254 nm of sufficient  energy and duration to inactivate contaminating pathogens, including  viruses.  

                          The  transfer of radiation energy directly, selectively and efficiently to the microbial  DNA limits secondary effects on liquid proteins, enzymes and other components  and minimizes the affect on nutritional, sensory and marketing attributes of  the natural product.







HOW DOES UV WORK?
The cellular DNA of the  micro-organism specifically absorbs UV-C at these wavelengths, damaging the DNA  of exposed cells by causing thymine dimer (peptide bond) formation in the  micro-organisms DNA.  The organism  becomes reproductively inactive, unable to replicate and, with no residual  effect, harmless to consumers. UV-C may be used in isolation or in combination  with other processing technologies.

SurePure Brewing Applications
In a  world first in the brewing industry, SurePure’s patented technology provides an  alternative to thermal processing within brewing:

Ambient liquid adjunct/liquid sugar processing:







• Ambient UV treatment of liquid adjunct (as opposed to boiling in the Brewhouse) results in energy savings of both heating (steam) and cooling (electricity for generation of “chilled Liquor”) as well as being beneficial to flavour, flavour stability and yielding throughput benefits.  

















Flavored Alcohol Beverage (FAB)/Cider Production: 

• FAB/Cider Production – Ambient production of Ciders and FAB’s “wort” via UV processing rather than boiling in the wort kettle and cooling during wort collection saved significant energy as well as improved brewery throughput. 

                  •	FAB / Cider Production pre container filling – The opportunity exists to lower the pasteurization units if UV is employed to sterilize the liquid prior to filling. This process saves on energy costs, water usage (and availability concerns), is beneficial to flavour stability and  has throughput benefits as transit times through the pasteurizer are reduced (placing the container filler at the bottom of the “V” profile in the pack hall – For FAB’s). 

 





Light stable beer sterile filtration



An opportunity exists to replace sterile  filtration with UV treatment for beer packaged in flint glass. This could also  generate savings in CO2 (for emptying sterile filters) and the water  used in the extensive cleaning that sterile filters require. 








Water  treatment:



“Cold” dilution water production is the  “newer” method of generation of dilution water. This process (whilst saving  energy on previous production methods) can result in microbial growth in the  D-plant as well as biofilm build up – UV exposure can be used here to prevent  microbial contamination. 


              Yeast Dilution water can be  photosterilized to prevent microbial contamination of yeast.







UV Treatment of effluent could result in a reduction in Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand and would lower the cost of water treatment. 




 UV Treatment of “Steep liquor” in the maltings process could result in a massive reduction in water required for malt generation via the reuse of the first steep water as a second steep.

Another exciting year has  passed, we would like to take this opportunity 
                  to thank you for your  support.  Did you know that the SurePure 
                  technology can treat any turbid  liquid?  Please see SurePure in 
                  action at a porcine plasma plant.
WATCH THE VIDEO >

























The patented SurePure Turbulator design increases the liquids’ exposure to UV-C,  enabling greater efficacy and consistency in purification. The turbulent flow of the liquid over the lamps ensures a non-fouling,   self-cleaning system whilsle multiple-lamp system guarantees added food-safety peace-of-mind. Our technology  delivers replicable, predictable germicidal efficacy.

Fruit juices can be processed using photopurification   to reduce the number of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, as well as yeasts and   moulds. In comparison to heat pasteurisation, juices treated with   photopurification enjoy a far more natural taste and colour. 

SurePure photopurification reduces the microbial load of milk at all levels and deactivates viruses, bacteria, yeasts and moulds. The process can also increase the shelf life of dairy products by at least 30%.  As it is a non-thermal process, the product being treated retains all its natural nutritional value.

SurePure Dairy Photopurification
 SurePure photopurification reduces the microbial load   of milk at all levels and deactivates viruses, bacteria, yeasts and moulds. The   process can also increase the shelf life of dairy products by at least   30%. 

                As it is a non-thermal process, the product being treated retains   all its natural nutritional value. 

                Milk producers as well as milk   processors can successfully apply photopurification either to lower the   microbial counts after milking or to prevent post pasteurisation   contamination.                  

Product Applications:




Pasteurised Milk /   Cream


Ambient Aseptically packed Pasteurised Milk / Cream


Chilled Milk / Cream


Ambient Aseptically packed Milk /   Cream
