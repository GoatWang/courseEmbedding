FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Triangle Capital LLC is a privately held financial advisory firm founded in New York in 2003 by three partners who all had successful careers at large Wall Street institutions.[1]
Richard Kestenbaum spent over 30 years as an investment banker at several firms, most recently at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner, and a boutique firm called Financo, Inc. Errol Glasser was a Managing Director responsible for West Coast investment banking activity at Kidder Peabody and a Principal in the Trump Group, a privately held New York-based investment company. The firm has made a name for itself in advising retail, apparel and consumer product companies such as Cross Pen, Red Envelope, Liz Lange Maternity, and Iconix Brand Group but also counts a diverse group of non retail companies on its roster of clients.
Kestenbaum is a regular speaker at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, in China at the invitation of the Chinese Government to members of the Chinese apparel manufacturing sector [2] and other industry forums. He is often quoted in Women’s Wear Daily and other industry publications.[3] Kestenbaum recently penned an article titled "7 Things to Consider Before Raising $$$", which was published in "The Accessories Magazine".[4]

History[edit]
Triangle Capital LLC was founded in 2003 when Glasser joined forces with Kestenbaum whom he had met when he was on the opposing side of a transaction years before.
Kestenbaum began his career at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner in the firm's New York office. Following the collapse of Drexel, Kestenbaum left to join Financo, Inc. where he served as managing director conducting the majority of that firm’s apparel transaction business during his 10-year tenure there. Kestenbaum has also written three books on finance and computer science[5] and taught International Business at New York University’s Stern School of Business.
Glasser is a native of South Africa, but came to the U.S. in 1978 after qualifying as a Chartered Accountant. He began his finance career at Revlon in corporate development. After joining Kidder Peabody in 1986, Glasser quickly rose in the ranks, joining the Operating Committee in 1991 and became the head of West Coast banking. After leaving Kidder, Glasser went out on his own, purchasing and running several different companies before getting back into investment banking. He has served on numerous boards including Tyco Toys, Montgomery Ward, Pay ‘n Save, Telescene and Regency Affiliates.
Business Services[edit]
Triangle Capital’s primary role is providing advice to middle market companies relating to mergers and acquisitions. Much of its work is sell-side engagements where the firm is hired to sell a company for its owners. Triangle Capital is also actively involved in raising capital for companies that are looking to grow, or want to recapitalize.
Triangle Capital has also been working to establish a foothold in China, believing that an increasing level of investment and M&A activity will be emanating from Chinese apparel manufacturers seeking to buy U.S. brands. Chinese manufacturers have a clear opportunity to move up the value chain by getting closer to the end consumer. It will also enable them to bring an established U.S. brand to the Chinese marketplace.[6] Triangle Capital is in a unique position to apply its in depth knowledge of the U.S. apparel, merchandising and retail market to assist these Chinese manufacturers in their endeavors.
Kestenbaum was recently highlighted in a Forbes article written about Alibaba's 11Main.Com site.[7]
In addition, the firm has worked with distressed firms in and out of bankruptcy.[8]
Triangle also includes fairness opinions among its services.

Triangle Capital LLC is a privately held financial advisory firm founded in New York in 2003 by three partners who all had successful careers at large Wall Street institutions.[1]
Richard Kestenbaum spent over 30 years as an investment banker at several firms, most recently at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner, and a boutique firm called Financo, Inc. Errol Glasser was a Managing Director responsible for West Coast investment banking activity at Kidder Peabody and a Principal in the Trump Group, a privately held New York-based investment company. The firm has made a name for itself in advising retail, apparel and consumer product companies such as Cross Pen, Red Envelope, Liz Lange Maternity, and Iconix Brand Group but also counts a diverse group of non retail companies on its roster of clients.
Kestenbaum is a regular speaker at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, in China at the invitation of the Chinese Government to members of the Chinese apparel manufacturing sector [2] and other industry forums. He is often quoted in Women’s Wear Daily and other industry publications.[3] Kestenbaum recently penned an article titled "7 Things to Consider Before Raising $$$", which was published in "The Accessories Magazine".[4]

History[edit]
Triangle Capital LLC was founded in 2003 when Glasser joined forces with Kestenbaum whom he had met when he was on the opposing side of a transaction years before.
Kestenbaum began his career at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner in the firm's New York office. Following the collapse of Drexel, Kestenbaum left to join Financo, Inc. where he served as managing director conducting the majority of that firm’s apparel transaction business during his 10-year tenure there. Kestenbaum has also written three books on finance and computer science[5] and taught International Business at New York University’s Stern School of Business.
Glasser is a native of South Africa, but came to the U.S. in 1978 after qualifying as a Chartered Accountant. He began his finance career at Revlon in corporate development. After joining Kidder Peabody in 1986, Glasser quickly rose in the ranks, joining the Operating Committee in 1991 and became the head of West Coast banking. After leaving Kidder, Glasser went out on his own, purchasing and running several different companies before getting back into investment banking. He has served on numerous boards including Tyco Toys, Montgomery Ward, Pay ‘n Save, Telescene and Regency Affiliates.
Business Services[edit]
Triangle Capital’s primary role is providing advice to middle market companies relating to mergers and acquisitions. Much of its work is sell-side engagements where the firm is hired to sell a company for its owners. Triangle Capital is also actively involved in raising capital for companies that are looking to grow, or want to recapitalize.
Triangle Capital has also been working to establish a foothold in China, believing that an increasing level of investment and M&A activity will be emanating from Chinese apparel manufacturers seeking to buy U.S. brands. Chinese manufacturers have a clear opportunity to move up the value chain by getting closer to the end consumer. It will also enable them to bring an established U.S. brand to the Chinese marketplace.[6] Triangle Capital is in a unique position to apply its in depth knowledge of the U.S. apparel, merchandising and retail market to assist these Chinese manufacturers in their endeavors.
Kestenbaum was recently highlighted in a Forbes article written about Alibaba's 11Main.Com site.[7]
In addition, the firm has worked with distressed firms in and out of bankruptcy.[8]
Triangle also includes fairness opinions among its services.

				Triangle Capital Corp. - Initiation Note



Triangle Capital Corp.
BUY (TCAP, $19.55)
Internally Managed, Disciplined Originator with Strong Growth Prospects and Prudent Capital Management - Initiating With A BUY Rating And $22 Price Target.
October 24, 2016

Investment Conclusion. We are initiating coverage of Triangle Capital Corp. (TCAP) with a BUY rating and $22 price target. Triangle is predominantly a subordinated lender, with subordinated debt and second lien notes comprising 69.7% of the portfolio at fair value as of 6/30/16 compared with 13.6% of senior debt and first lien notes. While this is certainly riskier given the subordinated position in the capital stack, Triangle utilizes conservative attachment point leverage (weighted average net debt/EBITDA) when structuring its investments. The attachment points are typically slightly above 4.0x through the company’s last dollar of risk. The company had a rough start to the year as its former CEO retired during 1Q16 which caused a significant hit to NII/share ($0.16), as did a reversal of dividend income they received the year prior. Backing out the onetime charges pertaining to the CEO’s retirement the company still earned only $0.45/share of NII, below the regular dividend of $0.54/share in 1Q16 before it was cut to $0.45/share during the second quarter. The company has emphasized that management grasps the reality of spread compression and are committed to preserving NAV/share; two notions that we certainly agree with. During 3Q16 Triangle completed a highly accretive secondary offering at a 34% premium to 2Q16 NAV/share and raised an estimated $129.1 million in net proceeds. The equity offering, combined with what we expect will be additional SBA debentures granted in 2017, will likely permit robust portfolio growth without the need for further equity issuance through 2016 and 2017. Our $22 price target implies an estimated 2017 P/NII of 11.3x, dividend yield of 8.2%, and P/NAV of 1.35x compared to the BDC sector averages of 9.0x, 10.2%, and 0.90x, respectively.
