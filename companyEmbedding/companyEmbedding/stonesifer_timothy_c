I purchased an OfficeJet 4650.  The install instructions were very slim, the DVD useless, the support web sites, unintelligible and there is no technical support phone number to call.  I just purchased my last HP product ever.

HP has apparently become one sorry operation.  I purchased a new Notebook in Feb 2017 which failed in 2.5 months. I followed all instructions, troubleshooting, eventually tech help who said send it back, under warranty.  I did but HP can’t seem to fix the machine they built.  Waiting now nearly a month, no updates, I have to constantly check on the service page to find status as HP does not send any timely info.  The estimated repair dates have been consistently wrong and aren’t updated unless I get through the hellish maze of contact pages and chat with a real person. So the simple truth I have learned, don’t buy HP laptops.

Summary of Laptop Model # 15-ay196nr Serial # CDN6415X3T
As I write this summary I would like YOU to keep in mind that I am a 68-year-old woman.  Probably old enough to be your grandmother and I feel that I have been treated unfairly and that this laptop is not the quality I expected from HP.
I currently own 3 other HP computers and an HP printer which is why I purchased this new laptop.  My 2008 Pavilion dv6000 with a Pentium 4 has much more dependability and better sound and much better quality.
Purchased during Thanksgiving holiday, 2016
Case #’s	3036471630
		3036678512
		3036681305
		3036720123
		3036681305
		3037266588
Note: I can forward all emails associated with the support tickets if there were any.  
Initial support techs blamed the computer issues on not using Internet Explorer and other support techs wanted after about 15 minutes to sell Smart Friend.
One tech person named Raj was excellent and I believe he was in quality control.
He transferred me after trying several different things to tech person named Pradeep in the hardware team.  Pradeep put request in to send me a box to send the laptop to HP service for repair.
2-16-17 shipped to Jefferson, Indiana for repair
2-17-17 was notified case was being transferred from Leo Sanchez X7813860 because he was being assigned to a new area (Leo Sanchez is an excellent employee)
2-22-17 received email from Sabrina X7813749
2-25-17 Computer shipped back and received on 3-1-17 – Note from tech said missing drivers, new hard drive and new fan installed
3-1-17 Began reinstalling all software
3-2-17 Notified Sabrina – no sound, blue tooth issues- tons of registry errors
No response back
3-3-17 Re-emailed Sabrina same issues
No response
3-6-17 Emailed Sabrina with continuing issues
3-7-17 Contacted HP Forum to request info on how to reach corporate or a higher up tech support
3-7-17 Sabrina emailed saying she understands we have same issues
3-8-17 Sabrina emailed saying she had been out on a birthday celebration holiday and was forwarding my issue to Mike X7715318 and it was case #3037266588
3-8-17 Received email from Mike and emailed him back with time and day to call
He did not call during designated time
3-9-17 Emailed my disappointment that he failed to call during appointed time he had agreed to
3-10-17 Email from Mike saying family emergency for his not calling
3-10-17 Case was turned over to Donavan Moore X7715624
3-11-17 Received message and email from Donavan to set up time to call on 3-14-17
3-14-17 Worked with Donavan on computer-fixed sound
3-15-17 Received email and spoke with Donavan to schedule for 3-22-17 after my next webinar to see if results of his work were completely fixed
3-22-17 I had scheduling issue so rescheduled for 3-23-17
3-23-17 Spoke at length with Donavan and worked on computer again.  Reinstalled audio and other drivers, a 2nd flash program and a 2nd Java plus Silverlight adjustment. Told him I would need to attend my next webinar to see if it played and then get back to him. He gave me a private email to email him Donavan.Moore at hp.com.  I asked him to hold the status of my issues until I got back to him via email at that address.
3-31-17 Emailed Donavan to private email
No response
4-3-17 Emailed Donavan to private email
No response
4-5-17 Emailed Donavan both to private and to original support email
No response
4-6-17 Emailed Sabrina
No response
4-12-17 Contacted HP Forum
I would also like you to know that on 3-31-17 I took it upon myself to contact Microsoft to verify that the issues the computer was having were not relating to the Windows Operating System.  I spent 2 grueling days with Microsoft support completing several different tests with the end result being that the Windows Operating System is functioning properly.
In summary, I do not feel that I can trust this laptop computer any longer.
Sincerely,
Sandy Morris

I have HP Pavilion 15au023cl  laptop and it is experience kernel power issues for over 4 months now. Repeated calls with the HP tech support has only resulted in formatting the laptop over and over again and failed repair attempts.
The tech support is hopeless, cannot figure out the problem with their own system.
and HP won’t even replace until god know how many failed repair attempts.
Highly disappointed in HP not likely to recommend at all!
Replace or refund!

I have an hp  envy  15 this is my second  HP laptop . I have been having so many issues with this device and whenever I call in for help I have to reset it or restore and I’m tired of this. So many times I have lost pictures and  things like that that I cant get back. I am currently a college student that takes classes online and all of these issues are causing a lot of problems. There is always trouble starting and shutting down and when it is on an error message comes up asking me to take recovery options. The laptop sometimes makes a ticking sound for what reason I don’t know and that is just the beginning of what I have endured with this laptop

Probably HP should take the complaints as a way to improve their business customer service and product quality. I feel good to know that I am not the only person that feels treated unfairly, but I wish things will get better. This affect all the party involved, the credit card companies, the retail stores that sell HP and the consumer. Reputation worth more than money. Now I know the reason the sales man in Staples was trying to help me to get another brand, probably it is a coincidence, probably no….

I got my HP laptop in December and the pc cracked when I closed the lid. After several attempts of negotiate, Hp blames me for their defective product and do not want to honor its manufacturer warrantee. Please review my records, I am not a liar. I have been an HP customer for years and I do not deserve this treatment.
Hp resolution was to for me to put in my credit card a 600 dollars debit for then send me a 250 dollars coupon toward another hp without fixing my laptop. This is not right. My case number is 303-828-9918. I wonder how HP gets away with treating their loyal customer like this. I bought my pc from Staples and I am still paying for it. Now I need to think what to do next, but it would be nice if HP will come to a resolution.

I purchased a computer and returned it.  When I called and talked to the return department the girl did a good job, I was so upset, I didn’t want to purchase another laptop.  Then I rethought things and called back.  I talked to customer service.  They told me something totally different from the return girl.  The person I spoke with spoke with her supervisor, and he only agreed to give me $50.00 off purchase.  I called today, 1st time I called…I sat there on the phone after someone answered it and didn’t say anything…I kept saying hello…hello… is anyone there….I could here typing on the computer…after 2 minutes of this the call was disconnected.  I called back upset of course.  and talked to customer service again (so this will be the 3rd person) about going ahead and purchasing the computer.  He gave me a totally different price and told me I wouldn’t get the same thing as I returned just with a different processor.  He would not honor the $50 unless I purchased the 3 yr. warranty.  I asked for him to listen to the tapes of the other calls.  He stated he couldn’t do that. I asked to speak to a supervisor.  He told me a supervisor wouldn’t help me.  I asked to have to supervisor pull the tapes of my previous conversations and told him this is the 3rd price I have gotten for this computer and the price keeps going up each time.  He told me a supervisor could not do that and would not help me.  I am very disappointed with the customer service I have received.  I have 2 HP desktops and wanted to purchase a laptop.  If I would have known all the problems I would have had…. I am very disappointed and upset.  Will not be purchasing a HP again.  You have lost a customer, especially after the way the last caller handled the call.  He should definitely not be in sales!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been a loyal HP customer since I purchased my first HP desktop in 2012. It is an all in one Touchsmart 520 with the bare minimums-6 gb ram, but it has served me well. I am currently working on a degree in Graphic Design and as my classes and software have become more complicated I decided to purchase a new laptop. As I also have an HP laser jet printer and have had nothing but the best service and products, getting an HP laptop was a no brainer. I purchased the notebook with 8 gb ram and better graphics. Imagine my surprise when I began working with the laptop. It is much slower than my old desktop and keeps giving me an error message. I work 10 1/2 hour shifts and commute over an each way daily so I don’t time on week days to call tech support. I was off today, Friday, and was excited to get my issue fixed. No. I purchased the laptop on 11/12/16 and called today, 3/17/17 and was told that my warranty has expired and that I will have to pay for technical support to fix the issue. Are you kidding me? I have had a product for four months and it has not worked as it should from the very beginning. I am outraged that HP does not take care of its products or customers. You have lost one of your best customers due to your lack of quality in your products and due to your lack of support. I will tell you that with a career in Graphic Design I need a product that is dependable. I also know that I will need to upgrade regularly. I can tell you that I will no longer be purchasing HP products and I will also tell my friends and co-workers so that they will not consider purchasing an HP product.

Case No:-3032242172|CN4CM233TN [ ref:_00DG0h8qk._50027m7w60:ref ]
I have for reference your Service Call Report S. No. 1605 17609 (attached), my various mail and letters regarding my NEW PRINTER, A9T81B, Series DH3545, Sl. No. CN4CM233TN
As can be seen from the Service Report of 04/11/16 the Scanner Top Cover was found to be broken and was “WAITING for WARRANTY” validation.
FOUR MONTHS have passed and there is still no news at all from HP regarding the replacement of my printer cover.
I contacted HP on the 2nd instant and was given the name and phone number (7479042738) of Ms. Moumita who, I was told, could help me..
When I rang her up, she mentioned she was busy scheduling the engineers’ to send her all details and she would ring back in half an hour/one hour. The call did not come.
On the 3rd inst., I tried contacting Ms. Moumita again at 9:39am, 10:06am and at 01:12pm.
The first two attempts went in vain as the phone just kept on ringing.. third time LUCKY..
As soon as I mentioned my name “Henry Castellino” she promptly repeated “Henry Castellino” and handed the phone over to one Mr Sarfaraz, who told me the printer cover was a “Cosmetic Item” hence was not available, but if I sent him my Invoice Copy he would calculate (under some T2Offer?) the amount I could get as a Discount for purchasing a new printer.
To process this Discount he said he would require my Invoice Copy…
I sent the Invoice copy on the 3rd instant…till date no reply…
May I have frank answers to the following…
1.	Is HP/IQOR waiting for the Warranty to EXPIRE before replying?
2.	I have attached photographs of the breakage.. Is it possible, under whatever circumstances, for a customer/end user to break the top cover in that way?? – the CLIP has chipped off.. if a customer had broken the top cover, the WHOLE clip would have broken off.
3.	I have re-attached photographs of your service engineer opening and repairing the “Stuck Scanner”. This was repaired TWICE so I feel that, at that time, the Cover had been broken.
This only came to light when I was working with the printer on November 2nd, 2016.
4.	All this apart, from the experience I have had so far with HP and allies, I feel I would have to pay for a new Scanner Top Cover, which, reluctantly, I guess I would perforce HAVE to!
I find it difficult to comprehend how, within a matter of 7 months, spare parts for a new (PREMIUM) Printer is not available…hence, I would request you to kindly arrange to supply and fit a Scanner Top Cover for my (NEW) PRINTER, A9T81B, Series DH3545, Sl. No. CN4CM233TN, purchased on 02/04/2016, installed by you on 06/04/2016 or REPLACE the same with a new one.
No discount/depreciated values and/or the likes is acceptable to me on my existing Printer.
Regards
(HENRY D CASTELLINO)

HP SCAM ALERT , I find this very disturbing, the fact that hp has indeed bein breeched by scammers they are calling from hp’s legitimate  # (1-800-752-0900) they have all client information , phone numbers , email , home address , previous computer problems , your sales info , ect ect , this is disturbing and they need to rectify this situation its there responsibility to protect there customers,,,,, and when I talk to customer service they have the nerve to tell me its my fault if when I have a call back date scheduled with legitimate HP tech support  and the scammer also has this information so the scammer calls from hp’s legitimate phone number and knows all specific account details and then he randomly asks for remote access , WTF , so I told him to call back later and let him play around on windows 95 just to see if he was a actual technician  and he was fraudulent , I suspected it so I didn’t get fooled , but I work on computers every day , this might not seem odd to the average user that’s waiting on a call back from hp …. HP NEEDS TO CORRECT THIS IMIDEATLY

Purchased a hp laptop for my daughter’s birthday in December  2016. Soon after she had problems with the charging connection on the laptop. Called and set up a case and repair number. Sent it in in early January 2017. I called in early February and they tell me it wouldn’t be Reay till April 11. That’s about 3 months without my daughters labor she uses for school. School will be out in late May. On top of that it only a year warranty on laptop so I’m getting beat out of 3 months worth of the warranty deal. Tried to talk to someone in charge and they gave me the run around. Called corporate and just sent me right back to the first people I started this ideal with. Worse costumer service I have ever encountered, and I have delta with some bad one. But this one makes those look like a cake walk. I usually don’t leave reviews or replies but I needed to do this. I’m going to tell my kids, family members and anyone who even thinks of purchasing a product from hp to think twice and they better warn anyone they care about to stay far away from hp products. It’s that bad.

I’ve always had Dell Computers (and never had problems with them), but for some reason in December 2014 I thought I’d try HP and purchased an All in One Pavilion 23 desktop computer, and all I’ve had are problems with it.  It’s been sent to HP 2x for repair, and the problems continue.  Here are the errors that continually come up when the pc is turned on “hard disk error; SMARTcheck: NOT installed; LONG DST: NOT installed; and this error comes up almost every time the pc is turned on “ERROR-NO BOOT DISK has been detected, or the DISK HAS FAILED!”.  What is this all about?  I have to manually turn the computer off and on several times before it works properly.  I have continually called HP and all they can offer me is additional warranty for $199/year.  HECK NO!!!  One technician asked me where I had purchased the computer, and when I told him BEST BUY, he told me that could be the problem because vendors keep their computers on shelves for years and by the time they are sold, the systems on the pc are outdated and may cause it to have problems.  REALLY???  SERIOUSLY??? My computer has been returned to HP 2x for repairs and the apparent repair action shows as ReplacedHDD.  So why do I continue to have the same problems???  I’m done with HP!!!!  Will never purchase another one of your products!!!

 This is a joke .
 if someone purchased a computer from hp i guess they want you  to buy if it needs formatting or repair they just want you to purchSE A NEW ONE OR REPAIR FROM A THIRD PARTY

First, I’ll say I know no business is perfect….BUT I’m quite frustrated with HP and the way they’re doing their business.  I ordered a laptop and wireless mouse on Dec. 5, 2016 for my daughter Christmas gift, well, my problem is I HAVE NOT RECEIVED HER LAPTOP as of today Jan. 10, 2017. This is totally unacceptable coming from a very reputable company. I’ve been on the phone numerous times, hours, minutes and days. First the laptop was being held in “customs in China”…. really?? I live in the U.S. and should have my laptop by now!  I was told I wouldn’t get it before Christmas so I had to buy another gift for my daughter to suffice for the laptop not getting to her on time as planned and knowing three weeks was more than enough time to receive it. In the meanwhile, I mentioned to the HP Rep that I wasn’t going to be at my job the week after Christmas and I was assured they would reroute the laptop to my home address.  Well, that did not happen it showed up at my job while it was closed for business and “Returned To Sender”, now for the past two weeks after talking with two “HP Rep and two HP Supervisors” my laptop is still sitting at supposedly the HP Warehouse and no one seems to be able to reach the warehouse for some reason.  I’ve asked for some sort of compensation for my inconvenience and I was offered a $10 credit…. Really HP?  The HP Reps at this point have no clue what’s going on and again this is totally unacceptable and I will spread the word furiously with everyone who it matters… BBB, Yelp, FTC, etc… I will give them till the end of the week, and if no word of my laptop…. I will get my full refund back for the laptop and wireless mouse. DELL I’ll be on your website because I don’t see it arriving on or before Friday…..

Dear Sir:
     I have only had Hewlett Packard Desk Top Computers ever since Windows 98 Version hit the market.  I have only had high regards for Hewlett Packard, until now.  Hewlett Packard is allowing non reputable service scammers to flag my new Windows 10 Desk Top Pavilion with warnings of over 300 viruses have infected my computer.  There is a number flagged to call immediately to Hewlett Packard Support with a 877-910-4204 number listed.  When I called, it was NOT Hewlett Packard Support, but Fasco Three Corporation as the un-American dialect stated when I asked if this is Hewlett Packard. ( I was brushed off but I kept asking is this Hewlett Packard Support.  Finally I was told it was not, but they have HP certified technicians.)  I said you have false advertising on Google with the 877 number that is listed.  To top it all off, they were charging over $100.00/year for a contract that will keep my computer clean and up to date.
    Dear HP, what can I do to keep these Scammers from flagging my computer of false information and what are you going to do with allowing false numbers be issued on Google and the Internet to make people think this is a bonafide Hewlett Packard Site?

The very same thing happen to me.  I changed cable companies and I could not get my printer to work properly.  It is still not working.  These are the HP Tech’s that tried to get my printer to work and could not.  Daniel, Kit, Likith. Daniel was on the phone for a least 7 hours, Kit was on the phone with me for hours as well and so was Likith.  None of these tech’s were able to help me.The printer did print for a while and stopped again and again.  Presently, my printer is not working again, and I can not print a simple document. 
I requested a new printer their reply to me was I did not need another printer, because there was nothing wrong with the one I have. However, it is not working, and they could not get it to work for a day. I begged them to speak to my cable company to resolve the problem with the printer, but they would not.  Does anyone think it is right for loyal customers  to go through changes like this. Where is the customer service, and I did receive a call to day about a virus on my computer and I was asked  what kind of computer I have I replied to them that I had a new computer and I would call the company to find out if I had a virus and hanged up because I knew it was a scam to get money.

I just bought a new laptop that worked fine except there was no key code to register Windows 10 which limited me to what I could use.  I called HP for help, got a girl I couldn’t even understand, we went through several processes and before I knew it, I got the blue screen of death. YUP, THAT’S RIGHT, an HP tech managed to crash my computer. She then did a complete hard drive restore which did not work. Before doing the hard drive restore, I specifically asked 3 TIMES, what about the Word programs and other programs I just downloaded and she stated don’t worry we can get them back, so I asked are you going to get them back and reinstall them, and she responded with Yes, yes don’t worry we will fix it for you.  GUESS WHAT, no one at HP is going to help me and basically told me they don’t know what to tell me call Microsoft Word.  Thank you for not only crashing my business computer, but know I, MYSELF, have to restore everything before I can finish my accounting for my accountant to do year end stuff. THANK YOU FOR SCREWING ME OVER, IN CASE HP DOESN’T REALIZE THIS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A DEADLINE ON WHEN TO GET OUT W-2’S.
This has not been the only problem I have had with HP products and their support system in the past year and a half. Then I try calling corporate who left me waiting for someone to answer my phone call for 45 minutes.  Needless to say I hung up. I used to love HP products. Not only has their products gone downhill and don’t last as long, but their customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!! Time to move on!!!!!

I bought my laptop in June of this year. I was taking a test for school on it and the screen went black. I called HP support and they were worthless. I could barley understand the techs I was talking to. HP out sources their technology support to some middle east country. I couldn’t take my laptop and where local to get it fixed. I had to send it. I am a full time student and I work full time. I should have been able to take my laptop somewhere to be fixed. It’s under warranty.  I am going back to Apple.  I’m so tired of dealing with HP. There are plenty of Apple stores I can take a laptop and have it fixed on the spot without sending it FedEx. My boyfriend has anot HP as well. His acts on its own. Opens programs on its own and shuts them down at will without touching the laptop.The arrow moves across the screen by its self. He’s going back to Apple as well. I shipped my laptop two weeks ago,  I called to see where it is, IT’S STILL THERE, LABEL ON IT, NOT SHIPPED. I can’t belive I waisted over $600 on that P.O.S.  I will be happy to spend $2000 on an Apple that will last me through school without all this B.S.

sent my laptop in for a warranty sound issue. after 2 plus hours allowing a group of three people with control of my laptop to not correct the issue… wasting my time. sending in for warranty, took another 1/2 hour to arrange. unit returned to me and upon using it the first couple of times this last week, it performed only at a snails pace.. it cant even delete history in less than 60 seconds. currently using my 8 year old hp lap… way faster. This unit can take 30 seconds to load a page… old pc… same page… 3 sec. very dissatisfied with this product… shouldn’t have purchased it… recall on it for battery issue just before my production date. another 1/2hr call and all I hear is it is now out of warranty with a problem I didn’t have before you worked on it under warranty. I would prefer my $$$ refunded rather than have to deal with you cs dept again. fix it or refund it but please do not waste more of my time

HP has to be one of the lowest forms of corporate life there is, only Comcast is ahead of it.
HP sends out a firmware update that renders aftermarket or recycled ink cartridges ineffective, hoping of course you’ll run out and buy their wildly over priced ink. This is not the first time. There was a class action suit for a very similar situation a few years back. This blasted behemoth thinks it can do anything it wants to damage a consumer and get away with it.
Well HP, it’s just not going to be tolerated. Your loosing market share in several areas due to incompetent management. You’ve made horrible acquisitions and you ran out of town on rail Carly “I think I want to be president” Fiorino after she nearly bankrupted you gangster outfit.

My name is Georgia. I am writing in regards to the HP Stream notebook that i purchased back in March of 2016. Back in late May i couldnt get it to download the updates for it. I called talked to a young gal and she got it done. the next time i called it would not boot up so that my husband and i could use it. I called again and was put on hold and hung up on 3 times. When i finally got to talk to someone i had been on hold for 45 minutes.
 when the young man that i was talking to got rude with me and accused me of not doing the backup step. I ended up getting a flash drive for free to get it working again. after several attempts to get it working it finally worked. About 3 weeks ago i came home from work to have my husband tell me that the screen to the computer is broken. I right away took a look at it. There is no damage to any part of the computer except for the screen underneath the top screen. I just called your help desk and was accused of damaging the computer. All that  was done to the computer was the screen was cleaned by my husband while it was off. He turned it on to use it and found that the screen was cracked. I was told that the screen being cracked is not covered by your warranty because it was an accidental damage. We did nothing to it except clean the screen. I must tell you that i am not happy with the service that i have gotten from your people at your customer service center. Most of them are rude and are quick to accuse the customer of damaging the product. I take very good care of my computers. I have never had a problem with any computer as much as i have had with HP. Unless i can get some help resolving this issue i have no choice but to tell my family and friends that HP does nothing to help you out if you have a problem with their HP computer. That the warranty is no good so they might as well leave it in the box and not use it. I hope that i will get some kind of a response to this email. I can be reached at 307-315-3686. If i dont  answer please leave a message and i will get back to you as soon as i can.

My brother purchased an HP pavilion laptop from cotsco for me. I barely got it out the box and had trouble with the system shutting down due to memory failure. I also noticed the speaker grid was not comepletely perforated. I suppose the factory in China was only concerned with getting the item out rather than a quality product. A full diagnostic was never performed before shipping, neither was the right processors were used (as far as I can ascertain). I would like to return the laptop for an exchange or return. I’m only hesitating due to the fact that my brother will have to be notified and he would not be “happy” about it (to say the least). I was told a shippingu box will bie sent to me to return the laptop for repair. My cocern is if a “supposedly freshly” built, brand new laptop needs repair, how long will it last? The laptop’s original price was just over $1,000. My brother specifically waited to get it on sale. (To think he wanted to buy a more advanced model makes me very relieved.) I cannot see the value of this laptop for the price their asking—-even on sale for half price of the sale price! I hope this incident can be resolved without foo much “drama”.

The contact numbers you show hear for their HP corporate are no longer accurate. Nor is the 800- 474-6836 “helpline” number…The corp. office one which has been “good” for some years is disconnected; the helpline one takes you to something called “Keitel Corporation” in Albany NY.
Of course, HP is in the tall grass again. This has got to be one of the worst companies ever…not that they always were. Once upon a time, the exact opposite was true. Now you can’t even get hold of them because they are such a miserable company everyone there is hiding under his or her desk.

Purchased an HP 550-a114 deskptop Windows 10 system after being told it could be expanded from 8GB RAM to 64GB RAM and that there were available slots on the motherboard for expansion (critical as the on board graphics would not suffice for the business application it was to be used for). After purchase, after SEVERAL hours on calls to tech support with incompetent individuals who didn’t know a single thing about htis system, I received by email from HP, a diagram of the motherboard with full specs.
1 Half height PCI xpress expansion slot only!
I purchased 1 additional 8GB RAM module and on openeing the case discovered…….NO SUCH PCI slot on the motherboard whatsoever!!!!!!!!!!
HP lied to me prior to purchase of this system; lied to me about the max RAM capability; lied about the motherboard; lied to me during the entire technical support process & left me with a RAM module I cannot return.
This system was for a Client (I have 25000 in West Texas and New Mexico). SERIOUSLY contemplating a mass email advising them NOT to consider HP for futer Computer System purchases after this debacle!

I am writing you as it has come to my attention that companies as yours, gives away laptops for certain reasons. Instead of going into a long story I will just be honest with you, and hope it will be enough. My Compaq is on it’s last leg and there’s no way I can afford to go out and get another. I bought this one when I first recieved my Social Security Disb. back money. I only recieve 820.00 a month and even with my Husband working we barely make groceries. My computer is my outlet to the world, I keep my medical portals with my Dr’s and stay in touch with my Children and Grand children, pictures and such. I am asking your company as I have an HP Deskjet 1000 printer so I thought it would make it easier if this was truly a legit possability. I was told companies give away Laptops as forms of promotions and I swear to God I would truly be Appreciative if I could qualify.

The Photo smart 7520 did not even last a year and it is beyound repair and HP send me a replacement printer HP Envy 7640.After installing the the replacement printer, I diid called HP and talk to Haudi from India an HP agent. and verify the warranty of this new printer and the extended warranty involved. He told me that all HP printer have a one year warranty, If that is the case that HP is guarranteing their one year warranty of every printer, and he said yes. I told him since this is the case I’ll have a total of four years warranty . I did ask him twicw about with agreed on. and he said absolutelly. Today I called about the ink contract and mentioned to chech for my warrantry, and I found out that this guy Kiv told me that that HP are only required for a three (3) warranty included with my extended warranty. I can’t believed what this guy is taling about, for Your agent before give me the four year warranty as stated. If Hp is committed to the warranty of their machine for one year, I don’t see any reason this warrantry was not honored. Also to remind you your agent is hard to understand, and not fit for customer satisfaction explanation. NEED YOUR ANSWER TO THIS MATTER.

Just received my custom hp 17t laptop and upon unpacking unit heard loose part(s) rattles from inside unit. Called customer service, agent had her own agenda and would not listen to what I had to say. After over one hour she gave me an address for  a service center in my area. Hover, it was not a service center but now a gaming center. Called tech support but they could not help and said I should possibly return unit and wait for a replacement to be made. Going overseas in one week, so a wait is not feasible.

HP
This is my seventh phone call in one week.  I bought my computer at Staples six months ago, I was told that my computer should be replaced, and was told that a box would be sent to me a week ago. I never got it.  I have spent a total of 7- 10 hours trying to get resolution.  I have been disconnected repeatedly.
I have been told by both the IT person and the staples manager that the computer should be replaced.  This is incredibly exasperating and if I don’t get this resolved, I will be going on numerous social media sites and explain how you have the worst customer service I have ever had.
I can tell you now, that I will never buy another HP product again and have already told people about my experience. I am in  a management position at a major university and have eliminated HP from our vendor list. Please feel free to write to me at dralisonfreeman at gmail.com

We own 4 HP laptops and are on our 3rd HP printer.  Loyal customers due to the thought that you provided a solid product and stood behind your workmanship.
HP Envy m6. The left hinge is separating the casing of the keyboard portion of the computer.  Countless reports online of the same thing happening to others.
After calling customer “Support” and speaking to someone from another country and his supervisor it has become clear that your company does not stand behind its products.  You created a product with a faulty part.  Your company should fix the part free of charge.
You have lost a customer and any future positive reference for your products.  Thank you for the frustration and complete dissatisfaction.

On the phone with HP, yet again, for our recently purchased HP Envy. The unit has been disabled more than it has been operable.  While HP support has attempted to be helpful by running remote diagnostics and hours of apologies for my inconvenience, there has been no resolve. I was instructed to reinstall the OS and that was supposed to fix the issue but again, no dice. Finally, the unit was shipped back to HP for repair. This week, I received the unit back and here I am on the phone with HP. I called in with my case number and was quickly advised that I should call the repair department. At the moment, I am being batted around HP’s customer support center, repeating the same information OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! My computer repeatedly freezes in various applications and the only solution is to shut the computer down and restart it. This ridiculous for a brand new CPU to be performing at this level. I am currently using my old trusty 7 year old HP All in One while the new and “improved one is being trouble shot! I am utterly disgusted with the amount of time that has been invested in trying to fix this CPU. Just send me a replacement unit and I will be happy!!!

I have had HP’s for a long time; since college, Med School, etc…
Within the past few years and in an effort to compete with other companies that produce the same products, HP has failed beyond reproach. I have unfortunately had to work with HP’s “Technical”and “Case Management” departments for well over 3-months and counting regarding a laptop that cost nearly $1,000. 
The last “Case Manager” (I will use initials instead of the employees full name), “T” I worked with (and 3 Replacement laptops later) I shared I did not want to continue the laptop trade-offs and wanted a full refund (of which they a had the original receipt) and I will purchase a different laptop via a different company until HP sorts out their “Issues” with the devices. He agreed. Many days later, I receive an e-mail (not the courtesy of a phone call) that the Case Manager “T” I had built a relationship with has been replaced with another. After speaking with the new Case Manager , “M” (after the receipt of the e-mail) it is obvious he had and still has no intention on wrapping this matter up. I contacted the “Corporate” Office at 650.857.1501 and asked for the Office of the President. The representative “J” shared, “We stand by the Case Managers and I will contact your Case Manager”. 
HP has no concern about the customer. After reading the posts on this site, it is painfully clear there is no allegiance/respect/regard or there of  as it pertains to HP and the company’s pseudo-relationship with the customer.  
HP has officially lost one of its faithful customers.
Unfortunate.
Best to you.

I’m currently on the phone with HP CASE MANAGER!!! I’ve been a LOYAL CUSTOMER SINCE 1999. After this, I’m DONE WITH THIS COMPANY FOREVER!!! I’m having issues regarding receiving my laptop which was supposed to be delivered by Fed Ex a week ago. I’m still having trouble getting my package delivered. They say they can’t deliver UPS, but I’ve had this problem previously and they ended up having it delivered UPS!!! They should utilize both companies if this is the case. I ALWAYS have PROBLEMS with Fed Ex delivery. Never a problem with UPS. HP is NO HELP!!!

Your story is truly unfortunate, for several important reasons. After resigning from the USAF following the Vietnam war, I accepted a position with IBM Corporation, first as a field engineer, then as a systems engineer and S.E. manager and finally as a marketing representative. Some of the most valuable lessons I learned from IBM (and they were great teachers) had to do with providing outstanding service. Their approach was that there are several good hardware and software manufacturers that customers can choose from. The single most important difference that would distinguish us from the competition was customer service. Whatever it took, we did, and we never told a customer we could not satisfy a hardware or a software request. Companies such as HP and Dell appeal to a particular marketplace that does not think in terms of service after the sale. Perhaps price is their overriding concern. I had purchased two HPs several years ago – one for a college-bound daughter, the other for my wife. My wife’s computer developed a networking problem over a month ago. I have, at last count, talked with 21 different “technicians” at various levels. None of them knows what they are doing. There is no logic, no thought flow, just an endless series of useless and unproductive activities. These kinds of people would never survive working for a company like IBM. The mindset is totally different. Unfortunately, those of us who are left to depend on them must find creative, non-HP ways to get our computers repaired. Like yourself, I will never have anything to do with HP again. Remember the “dollar vote” – every time someone buys inferior merchandise, they are casting their vote for more of the same. Best of luck to you.

I purchased an HP 500-223W brand new, it doesn’t show a picture at all. Me knowing a little about CPU’S know that chances are its the video board!!! I’ve contacted HP customer service on Tuesday March 14,2016. After spending 2 hours of my day on the phone with foreigners, telling me that my warranty is out even though I just purchased the computer the day before, they finally decided to say that they will fix it for free. Supposably they agreed to send me a box with a free shipping label. They said it will take 2-3 business days before I will receive the Bo’s at my door step. Today is the third day and still no box. Never bought something brand new and had so many problems with it. I will be reporting this to the BBB first thing Monday morning. I’ll never purchase anything that has an HP logo on it again.

We bought 40 HP scanjets and none of the buttons work with windows 7. On hp website it says it is compatible with the G3110, but it is not. None of the HP techs can get any of the 40 scanners to work on a windows 7 machine. So we wanted them to replace them. They replaced 6 of them and since October of 2015 we have had this issue and HP does not seem to want to make it right and replace the others that dont work with windows 7 even though their site says it will. That makes pretty crappy customer service!!!!

I have had the same problem.  I was hired as an office manager in a new company.  Right after the computer was connected to the internet I couldn’t get the printer to work.  I called HP and asked them why the printer wasn’t working.  They told me that the PC has been hacked and it corrupted the printer.  I told them that it was just connected to the internet service just a few hours ago.  It cost me $150.00 to so called “correct” the problem.  The company got a new printer because we needed a fax machine.  Everything was working fine but a few weeks later the printer stopped printing again.  I called HP and they said the printer was corrupted and they would send me a refurbished one in place of the new one that was just purchased and in the mean time they would make this one run….for another $150.00, which we paid.  
The company was having a hard time getting online with the internet server we had so we had to switch providers.  Wouldn’t you know it!  The printer didn’t work again!  I called HP and they said it was corrupted again and they could fix it for me.  I said, let me guess for another $150.00 dollars right?!   I disconnected the phone call and I started looking into the problem myself and I figured it out.
We have bought two printers and we’re out $300.00
What ever you do, do not call the support team because it will cost $150.00 every time you call!

Instant Ink!!!! Very interesting scam I mean program. I have just been informed that paying into this program pays for pages used not the ink. I also found out that even though I have only used one quarter of the ink in a 12 mo. period and want to cancel my program the cartridges will no longer function. Very nice scam. I was never informed that you “own” the cartridges. I thought since I’ve been paying for over a year now that I could at least finish what I haven’t used if I cancel the program. You see I only print about 5 to 10 pages a month. Not worth paying into the program. I will be sure to inform my friends and family of this scam and I will never buy another HP product again. I had an HP printer before this and it never worked right from day one. I was constantly on the phone with tech services. I thought I’d give HP another chance but as usual there’s always a catch. Cust service could only apologize which does me no good. I am still stuck with this printer. Not to mention Staples has the combo pack ink cartridges for $54. less than I’ve paid for your instant ink program.

A couple of years ago, I bought two HP DV9720US laptops – one for daughter, one for wife. My wife almost expired from a brain-stem aneurysm several months ago. That was followed by a stroke. She is bedbound and can only enjoy TV and her laptop. About a month ago (6/12), it lost networking capability, and the DVD drive stopped working. I spent hours on the phone talking with 3 levels of “tech support”. No one had a clue. Several started trying to steer me to “parts repair” which is outside of my maintenance agreement with them. One level 3 technician in Canada advised me to  order $40 of CDs from “Computer Surgeons”. These have done nothing. I replaced the DVD drive with a new one that reads the CDs, but with no device manager entry for it (or for networking), I’m not sure what to do with the CDs – nor is anyone else at HP. As a neuroscientist at a medical school, I certainly will not be recommending HP to colleagues, students, acquaintances, friends, relatives or anyone else. They made their buck dishonestly; they won’t make another from me. I don’t know how else to get the message to these kinds of vendors. If they go into bankruptcy, it is due to mismanagement and no sense of sound business ethics.

Had a HP laser jet that had mechanical problems in August called hp after several hours on the phone they said that it needed to be replaced and I needed to send them proof of when I brought the printer scanned and emailed the receipt two days And no contact so I called  and was told so sorry but the warranty ran out 2 days prior to me callings do there was nothing they could do for me but they could sell me a new printer, no thank you. I went to staples instead intending to buy a different brand but there happen to be a HP rep. In the store when I was looking at printers and he asked why I was looking at printers other than HP when I told him of my experience with customer support he said he was sorry and if I would reconsider HP he would try to make it up to me for the bad experience. I did and he gave me a toner cartridge and a extended warranty for three years that was in September. In November when making copies with the auto sheet feeder one or two lines would be through the page but not if I single sheet on the glass. Yes I cleaned everything (just so you know I am a computer technician) so I called hp on November 18th after going through all the gyrations including up dating the firm ware I was told that the printer would have to be replaced and was transferred to a hardware supervisor who took all my info but because their system was down for processing credit cards (which was needed to assure returning of the defected printer) they would call back as soon as the system was up. Received all back the next day she placed the order and the replacement printer would arrive Dec 1st cause of the thanksgiving holiday and all, no problem since I was going on vacation and was not returning til Dec 15th anyway but someone would be here to receive it. When I returned from vacation no printer. So I called after 45 minutes on the phone the “support” person couldn’t under stand why but the order was canceled and that it would have to be reordered. Ok stuff happens so he transferred me to a hardware supervisor. So sorry but they couldn’t place the order right then because there system was down but they would call me back. After playing phone tag for a couple of days we finally got together on the phone and he was sorry but he couldn’t place the order I would have to provide proof of purchase at this point I asked if he could send me an email with those instructions he told me no I had to go to  such and such website and follow the instructions at this point I insisted that I needed emailed instructions;no he couldn’t do that so he escalated the issue to Ruth who is a Case Manager on the Hewlett Packard AMS TCO Escalations team responsible for resolving my issue that was on dec 21st. She sent me an email stating the above with her contact info etc upon receiving her email I replied to it with the situation wand a copy of the reciept and all the information to which I got no answer so the next day I replied again to the email. Still no response, we closed for Xmas ok I deal with this after. Tuesday Dec 29th I followed the instructions in the email again by replying to it and still no response. January 4th having all her contact info I called, and got her voice mail the message stated that she would  be in from 1 to 8 or so please leave a message and the best time to return your call and she would do so. My message  was “this is my cell number and I am available any time looking forward to hearing From her. Today is the 8th of January and I have had no response . Now I have spent so much of my time that I could have brought 4 replacement printers and be ahead of the game: now I’m getting pig headed about this and I don’t care how much time it cost me and will be sending this to anyone I can at hp and any where else

But because HP has the reputation for sending them back not fixed I should call HP first and have them authorize sending it back.  THREE HOURS on the phone with techs overseas who not only couldnt fix it but kept transfering me to more techs. finally gave up called main corporate Guess what…back to India.   NEVER BUY HP!!!!!!!!!

I began the saga of getting help on a laptop 2 1/2 hours ago and found this site to describe how much fun it is.  After a sales pitch from a representative (probably in India) who guaranteed a solution to my issue, I agree to pay $99 for a one time service.  He asked me to hold for a few minutes to make sure the payment was made.  Sure enough after about ten minutes he came back and said everything was fine and he would transfer me to someone who would respond in about three minutes.  35 minutes later the phone went dead.  Started the process again, While I usually get a notification that they are experiencing high call volume, I sometime either get shut off again after about twenty minutes or someone comes on so I can explain the case all over again.  The person says no problem, asks a few questions and says they can fix the problem, but hold on for a few minutes.  They then come back and say that I need to be transferred, they make the transfer which rings a few times, and the phone goes dead.  So what have I gotten for 2 1/2 hours of my time, a bill for $99 and no results.

HP IS THE WORST. NEVER ORDER FROM THEM. I had serious doubts about ordering from HP but thought I would give it a try.  I ordered a mere quantity of three 201X Color Laser Jet cartridges.  HP charged my card immediately and never shipped one damn thing and now they are waiting for a return (which doesn’t exist) to their warehouse. I have spent 3 hours on the phone trying to straighten this out and it has now been 10 days since I ordered. Based on my tracing, Fed-Ex never received the shipment; it had only created a label.  It is now Dec 7 and they are telling me they are waiting for the return shipment to credit my card.  I told them there is no return as nothing was shipped and they are still telling me it will take 6 to 7 days to get me a credit. INCREDIBLE!

spent 50 minutes this morning and nearly 2 hours this evening trying to speak to at least one Customer Service Rep.  It appears there is no such thing at HP.  During these painful attempts got at least 11 HP-ers on the line, 6 could not even transfer a phone internally to another dept. Instead I’d get the msg. “exit point, call not passed” or something similar.  The web site “support” number is no different than any other HP number and also does not offer a chance to speak to a human with the task of giving service to a Customer. In over 40 yrs as a professional I’ve never encountered anything even close to the absolutely abysmal handling of customers as experienced with HP.  They deserve to fail, and quickly.

I’ve been trying to get a working computer from HP since 2008. My original computer didn’t work correctly from the time of purchase. After three years of repairing it and it catching my bed on fire and my legs they said if I paid $300 they would fix everything on it. It couldn’t be repaired. They’ve sent me computers that didn’t work brand new repeatedly. Each replacement takes at least six months without a computer. I had one in all the replacements that’s I liked but a line of pixels burnt out on the screen when the computer was 4 months old  so I was afraid the screen was going and sent it in for repair. They replaced the screen but then the computer wouldn’t work right. I sent it back and once again it couldn’t be repaired. That computer has been replaced three more times with on that was missing features that it was suppose to have so they sent me another that the speaker didn’t work on and then they built me a custom computer last October that hasn’t worked since I received it. It’s been back for repairs in which they didn’t address what I said was wrong and the manager Sonny told me he “he didn’t give a rat’s ass if the computer worked or not and that no one but him was going to speak to me ” yet he wouldn’t speak to me. My current case manager who had been great though she had left me with a broken computer forever won’t return my calls or emails now nor will anyone at the general voice mail in her office. DO NOT BUY HP!!!

I purchased a $500 printer from HP. I have had nothing but trouble with this particular model. HP has sent me three refurbished replacements and I am still having issues. I have contacted the technical support department numerous of times. Unfortunately, the calls are routed to India. The customer service/technical support representatives in India do not comprehend English! I contacted the corporate office for assistance. The customer service representative and case manager were not able to assist me. Both individuals stated the CEO and COO do not take calls from customers. I will NEVER purchase another HP product!!

I bought a new laptop and after opening box was forced to sign away constitutional rights to use my own computer.  HP demanded ability to record voice, take photos of me, enter and transfer files to others. Basically, I lost control of my laptop, privacy and rights. Then they had the nerve to say I could not sue them. Congress will hear from me, especially in light of supreme court cases saying if you buy it, it is yours!

Large investment about 5 years ago for our business/personal needs. For some time I called and spoke with English speaking people who helped me immediately.  Then we went far far away.  You canNOT believe the difference.
Yesterday spoke with about 4 of your mumbai customer service reps.  kept getting changed from one dept to another.  Last week my husband had a problem, paid $199.00 for a one year service contract.  We had always had the contracts but our equipment is JUST 5 years old. Now considered obsolete by HP.  They used to be $99.00.
One of your reps wouldn’t go further until I gave him my visa and he said I would be charged 59.00 A N D  couldn’t fix it, made some comment I didn’t hear and disappeared.  We were ready to buy new equipment but your customer service doesn’t warrant my business.  I would certainly appreciate an American answer to this.  How can you get away with it.  I understand there are thousands in this location in India…..don’t we American customers deserve American speaking help?  We also deserve work or isn’t this an American company anymore…………………….

Wow!  I wish I would’ve looked at this before I bought an HP Printer last fall.  I have to say, I have never had a bad experience with their printers until I purchased the Laserjet M476nw.  It has software issues.  I purchased it in Oct 2014 and immediately contacted HP support.  It is May 2015 with one replacement down, two visits from a tech at my location, multiple occasions of remoting into my computer (which I don’t particularly like as a business owner), and still no working printer.  They ask, do you want a replacement?  No!  I don’t think the third will work any better.  Not to mention, they say they will call and I am still waiting.  It is to the point where I have to record names, phone numbers, log emails, etc.   There are case numbers but they either dont read them or they say they dont have the information….”it is in another department”.  Rediculous!!

I have some concerns about your “All-IN-ONE”, printer, scanner, copier, & fax.  This is the second time this year I’ve had issues with HP Ink.
The first time was 01-05-2015 at 6:40 a m (mt), Case # 3011106773, I spoke with Christen.  I had purchased a multi-pack of ink and the yellow did not work. They did send me a replacement.
Now, 05-04-2015 12:30 p m (mt), after getting a message the black ink is depleted and replacing it, again I had problems with the carriages: Case # 3015751893 I spoke with Kevin, he had me reset the printer by unplugging & re-plugging then taking out all the ink carriages, reading the info on the screen, putting them all back, read info, put in old black carriage, read info.
It was determined the new carriages is faulty. They will send another one #BFRB0647-01. 
I buy HP products because I was told by someone that HP brands are usually repairable, whereas other brands are mostly throwaway. However, what about the ink carriages?
I’m sometimes up late getting work done for stuff I’ll need for the next day.  If I run out of ink, as I have done twice, I like to have extra ink, just in case.
Both times this has happened it was 2-3 a m, and both on weekends, and the so called extra carriage did not work. HP usually send me replacements but that does not happen until three days later, which does not help me for the next days work.
I’m purchasing Genuine HP carriages from reputable places. The multi-pack from Costco and the single black carriages from Wal-Mart.
I also have an L7650 model with a bad print head.
I wonder if I would do better with some of the other, cheaper brands.

I TOLD HER THAT I PAY MONTHLY FOR MY COMPUTER TO BE FIXED WHEN NEEDED, INSTEAD I GET PASSED FROM TROUBLE TO TROUBLE. SHE THEN WENT ON TO SAY, THAT I HAVE TALKED TO THEM ENOUGH, THAT MY MONEY, (WHAT I WAS TOLD TO BE MY INSURANCE MONEY, TO KEEP MY COMPUTER MAINTENANCED, WHEN NEEDED), KAREN SAID THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON THE NUMEROUS TIMES, THAT I KEEP CALLING BACK COMPLAINING ABOUT MY COMPUTER, SO THERE FOR, I WILL NOT BE GETTING ANY REFUND, AND IF I ATTEMPT TO CANCEL MY CONTRACT, (I interrupted her, CONTRACT)!!!???? (I TOLD HER, I DON`T HAVE ANY CONTRACT WITH HEW & PAC)!!! SHE SAID THAT I SOULD HAD READ MY EMAILS, AND I WILL BE PAYING A $70.00 FEE. I TOLD KAREN, THE MAN ON THE PHONE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION ABOUT ANY CONTRACT, OF ANY KIND. SO THAT TRUMPED-UP, WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, OR CONSENT OF EMAIL, HOLDS NOTHING. I THEN ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER OR HER SUPERVISOR. SHE WENT ON TO SAY, THAT SHE IS!! THE SUPERVISOR, SO NO THERE IS NOT ANYONE ELSE OVER HER FOR ME TO SPEAK WITH.

I am trying to register a newly purchased laptop and am finding a lot of trouble.  I get a lot of warnings that my new computer has viruses. I find that hard to believe. one site told me to take the new laptop to staples to get it fixed for almost as much as I paid for the laptop.  Or, they said they could fix it for halve the price.  I finally got off line with these jokers.
What do you recommend. the data provided with the laptop doesn’t giv eme anything..

I am trying to reach Corporate Office Manager at minimum who can help me respectively with 1 of my HP Products (HP Office Jet Printer 8600.  I purchased item & only used up the starter cartridge & the another print head did not work.
I have received absurd & crazy communication with tech support.  The printer was determined it was junk & done!
As a customer who liked HP & believed in products, But I would never buy another HP again with THE SO CALLED SERVICE PROVIDED VERY BADLY BY HP.  MOREOVER, NOBODY SHOULD BE TREATED AS I HAVE!!  HP WORKERS REFUSE TO GET ME TO A MANAGER WHO COULD HELP OTHER THAN HP TRYING TO BUY ANOTHER HP PRINTER AT A PETHETIC DISCOUNT!  I PAID A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON A PRINTER TO ONLY GET TO USE BLACK INK STARTER CARTRIDGE.  I ALSO BOUGHT A NEW CARTRIDGE!
THE 1ST REP. SAID HE WAS GOING TO SEND ME A CARTRIDGE BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
I HAVE EXTENSIVE NOTES FROM MY CONTACT WITH HP WHICH IS CRAZY!
I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE BEING CONTACTED BY CORPORATE OFFECE TO RECTIFY THIS MESS!  NEVER EXPECTED SUCH BAD SERVICE AS REPEATEDLY HAVE BY HP!
I REALLY TO NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS MATTER TO MY ATTORNEY, OR TO EVERY OUTLET & EXPRESS EXACTLY HOW HP REPRESENTIVES WERE EXTREMELY BAD!

I am having the same issues as most of the complaints posted.  Whatever happen to customer service being a number one priority to maintain satisfaction and company reputation.  I bought a brand new HP Envy 700 desktop in September 2013 and on October 20, 2014 the motherboard was no good.  Really?  And of course the warranty had expired exactly after one year in September 2014.  To add insult to injury I still owed $360.00 on the computer.  I just want HP to know that I am returning their computer to the local Best Buy where I purchased it, I am not paying the balance and I will let Best Buy deal with it.  It may be reported to the credit bureau but I own nothing, need nothing so I don’t really care what they report.  Never will I purchase an HP product.

I have been reading through the forum’s of unsatisfied customers complaints. Hewlett Packard seems to have forgotten the old adage “When a person walks through our door they have our money.” After the experience’s I’ve had I will never give them another penny. In January I bought a windows 8 notebook model #2000-2D24DX I came across 2 problems by May of 2014 it would not configure windows updates and the DVD drive did not work. They were pleasant at first and sent me a box to send it out for repair and I did. In it’s place I got back a windows 7 note book and have had nothing but problems ever since. I have sent it back twice already because the system operates slower than my 1991 dell and it keeps losing it’s wireless communications with available net works. What I want to know is why didn’t Hewlett Packard repair my original notebook and why are they refusing to replace the original with a compatible one?

In 2013 I purchased a HP Laptop Windows 8 for my wife’s birthday.  We attempted to operate this computer but found that Windows 8 was very difficult for us to operate.  We made several attempts without success.  At that point we gave up and put it away.  We recently made another attempt and could not find our password.  Now I have a totally useless computer.
My questions:
Is there anyway we can get around this password problem?
Is there anywhere we can go to an authorized vendor or send this computer to fix this problem?
Also, is there anyway we can change Windows 8 to Windows 7?  This operating system is something we can work with. 
We have always used HP products but very unhappy with Windows 8.

This is no doubt a waste of time but I purchased a new touch all in one to replace an old HP that has served me well for years.  Now I find that I cannot open some e-mails, etc. as I no longer have Word?  This ability to create charts, letters, etc. is why I own a computer.  When I spoke with someone, I was told that I have to pay to get Word – it is no longer supplied by HP on every system.  
I can guarantee you as soon as I can find someone dumb enough to take this off my desk, I will have a new Apple replacing it.
Thanks for amazing me in your policies.

I purchased an HP15 in April 2014 and have had nothing but problems since day 17, ironically 2 days after Wal-Mart’s 15 day return policy. I did not purchase the additional warrantee offered by Wal-Mart since HP offers a 1 yr. parts and repair/ replacement warrantee. I have had to send laptop back to HP twice for repair since April of this year, pretty sad to have for only 5 months and already problems.
I called HP yesterday (Monday 9-22-2014) wasted about an hour talking to tech support most of which was me saying “huh” because I couldn’t understand what they were saying because of their thick accent. The agent took my #, gave me a case #. I was promised a manager would call and make things right with my pc…….well, glad I’m not holding my breath because I’m still waiting for that call!  HEWLETT PACKARD LACKS GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND I’M BEGINING TO WONDER IF THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NEXT TIME I WILL PURCHASE A DIFFERENT BRAND OF LAPTOP, SURE HATE THESE EXPENSIVE LIFE LESSONS!!

Dissatisfied Customer
On September 1, 2014, I ordered and paid for a lap top for my daughter for college l.  After calling twice and talked to like I’m ignorant to check the status of my order. Ironically the day the lap top was due to ship I called again for a status update rolls by a supervisor their were no problems I could expect the shipping information.  In stead I receive an email saying sorry for the inconvenience but your date head changed to October  1.  Really how does that help my daughter.

I just had the most HORRIBLE customer service experience with a sales rep by the name of  Katie/Kerri. I recognized her voice several times and each time she is either Katie or Kerri. I was argued with and yelled at on the telephone. I was also told that I could never order from HP’s website…ever and to take my services else where. She specifically told me to go to Best Buy. I have never been so angry in my life! She also refused to let me speak with a supervisor. I really am baffled as to how she is working in the customer service industry. I have worked in customer service for over a decade and have never witnessed someone yelling at a customer because they are asking a question. I WILL be contacting corporate and reporting this agent everyday if I have to.

Wow HP – lots of the same complaints – and you say you’re sooo improving customer relations? What a joke.  I’ve been trying to get a replacement computer for almost a year now.  When you finally do get a case number and worker, you’re ignored forever unless you call every day.  Your case “supervisors” can’t be bothered to call is what I’ve been told.  I’ve been pushed to the point of wanting to scream at you people.  I paid money in good faith to purchase your lousy product. I expect it to work correctly.  So, with no word, again, from your wonderful case managers, I’m going to give the Wall Street Journal and MSNBC a call.  Lets discuss what a great job Meg Whitman is doing so far.

Sunny, I’m with you. We ordered a desktop through our phone company who has an “arrangement” with HP to sell a few of their computers. I’m a desktop guy and luckily, the phone company offered only ONE, but it seemed decent and was advertised as not just having a CD Drive, but also a CD Burner…something I sorta needed(and still do!) When the pc got here, it was a completely different one from what we’d ordered. After numerous and fruitless phone calls with the phone company, I was finally directed to the head of the warehouse. He was a super slick “salesman”, rattling off specs, etc. on the pc that was delivered and simply wore me down and I STUPIDLY agreed to just keep it since it was already here and had BEEN here for a month, still in the box. Since that time, one year into ownership, the OS failed. Since then it’s been memory crash dump after memory crash dump, sometimes as many as 2 in the same day. As of yesterday, it’d crashed 4 times in as many days. The phone company’s “tech dept” has told me numerous reasons causing the problem, and finally last week and definitive answer was given in less than 5 minutes! I called HP immediately and explained everything to the “tech” there, and was told “we’re so sorry, but your warranty expired a month and a day ago”, and there was ZERO offer to try to resolve the situation. Yesterday, I spent from approx 2pm until almost 10pm!, on the phone with the phone company and HP. HP had me run some kind of test, and when it was done and showed 7 different issues, she didn’t even want to hear what they were, she just wanted to go to another LONG test to check the processor, and promised to call in about 30 minutes, which would’ve been about 6:05pm. It’s 10:25am the next day, and still no call, and oddly, I’m not surprised one bit. Between the phone company and HP, they’ll end up losing more business by unhappy customers than if they’d just admit they had a faulty product and offer a new one, and I’ve already told the phone company that I know ALL too well how to use social networking and sites like Change.org and other sites to put out the word on bad products and bad service. I’ve owned a business before, and to keep a good customer base, sometimes you simply have to bite the bullet and lose a couple dollars if it means KEEPING the customer and having the free POSITIVE word of mouth advertising. Neither the phone company nor HP seem to understand this…I guess they think like the bank not too long ago…they’re too big to fail(or fall). I hope your situation finally got resolved, and everybody else’s who’s posted here, and wish me luck as I’m about to call corporate and have a “prayer session” with them about both the product AND the “tech help”, which was a joke from the second we were connected. HP would also be wise to hire people who can actually F^#**@!G SPEAK ENGLISH for English speaking customers!!!!!!!!!!!

Is it also company policy to hear a complaint and a name yet transfer the customer right back to the person they are wishing to report

I have a defective printer cartridge — when I installed it, the msg, “At least one of the cartridges has a problem”.  I have been through all the steps to try to fix the problem and I am sure it is a defective cartridge (60XL).  I purchased it directly from HP on 5/29/14.  There is no way to email HP and get a replacement cartridge.  I had a problem a few years ago and ended up contacting the Board of Directors to get assistance.  I don’t wish to go to such lengths this time. I just want a replacement 60XL cartridge.

Lost  fax contact between laser-printer-fax machine and computer. I could print but not send faxes from HP Tool Box fax number contact list. I had to work on Monday, Susan called HP support to get it re connected. She was on the telephone from 10:00 am until 4:00 p.m. with no results. The tech person in India was useless, wanted Susan to give her credit card number to finish connection. I was home when this happened and told her donot give number out until we can verify it is working.
How can anyone working as a so called tech support for six hours booting-rebooting system, repeatedly trying to download and then entering wrong laser/printer to connect to!!!  I will never buy another HP product, customer service is terrible, cannot understand a word they are saying. Need ENGLISH speaking support in the USA and stop out sourcing. Tried to call 800 number for assistance-again HP not user friendly- computer generated operator trying to direct my calls over and over. Frustrated I just hung up!!
HP is terrible !!!! By the way as of right now-printer/fax machine still not working and have lost all contact with it. Tried to start all over  myself with HP Laserjet M1530 disc
no luck at all after two hour of trying to download . Kept saying taking too long and would not connect.

Ditto on the worst customer service.  Purchased 2 printers (the same) in January – 1 worked, the other defective;  received replacement – LCD not liting up, have to use flashlight to read and sometimes it won’t copy;  the 1st return label was an enormous bar code, FedEx said it was corrupt;  contacted Richard (HP case manager) several times for new label, received 2 letters from HP scolding me about good faith and accused me of failing to return printer;  received FedEx label;  FedEx’s scanner couldn’t scan the label, the driver called her boss who helped resolve the issue;  tried to return replacement printer but the printer FedEx picked up can’t be found;  just received email from Richard saying ‘without proof of the other printer being returned to us, the only option is to replace your printer with a refurbished model.’  Well… I didn’t provide the FedEx label now, did I Richard?  And I used to work at HP!  Contacting all my HP buddies and family members who work there for Meg’s address.  This is beyond ridiculous.

Three months to get a case number followed by three more months of dead silence.
I bought an HP laptop on Sept. 11, 2013 . The touch pad didn’t function from day one. It took me a lot of time and frustration until I got an HP support case number on Jan. 19, 2014. I am quoting their answer:
“Hi ,
We have received your email. Our support agent will contact you shortly.
Case number for the case created: 3000872629
Thanks,
HP Support”
No one contacted me since then. When I replied to the above HP email It failed time and time again. I tried a number of times to call HP from abroad where I have been traveling. Each time I waited over 20 minutes listening to HP advertisement how good they are but no one answered.
I was looking forward to having a good, new laptop with me but instead I have been carrying a heavy dead laptop, spending a fortune on phone calls to a “reputable” company that does not care one bit about its costumers and make it as difficult as possible for them to contact HP.
I will consider it to be a miracle if HP would care seeing this post and contact me

Reference: ENVY Laptop computer Serial # 5cg32711L5
Dear Ms. Whitman,
I am writing to you regarding one of three Laptop computers I purchased from your company over the summer. I have been attempting to seek repairs for one of the laptops for the last several months to no avail. I am taking this directly to you as this issue seems to be a serious flaw in customer support which should be immediatly addressed.
I am unable to seek ANY service repair for a completly new laptop
I have spoken repeatedly to customer service, a total of 6 telephone calls  for over three and a half hours with customer support, long distance, with no resolution. I have submitted  the laptop to my local HP repair representive and have had the computer returned unfixed. The latest call to customer support today for 45 minutes resulted in, AGAIN!, the representive telling me he will call me back in a couple minutes and, again, I never receive a return call.
The only solution offered  by your customer support was, I mail the computer I purchased back to the country it was purchased in, to someone I may know, so they can send the computer through your prepaid box, you can send to them, to a repair center named in advance, so they may repair the already documented broken mother board, then return the computer to someone I know in the country the computer was purchased in, and they will in tern then mail the computer back to me in the country i currently am working in.
Logistically, this is a nightmare. Cost wise through shipping alone i will pay next to the cost  of a new machine. This process will take 3 months in mail and delivery time, repair is still an unknown, and burdens many people. This is an ineffective and utterly total waist of my time and yours, money loss for your company and your customers satisfaction has been destroyed.
Now, let me point out this small detail, I was in schipol airport yesterday and purchased electronics at a store. IF it were your computer, would you require me to find someone I know at the airport to return the computer to be fixed???, What with hong kong or spain. The logic your support is giving to me is crap that the computer I have has to be repaired in the country it was purchased in. I bought HP because I know (or at least assumed albeit incorrectly it seems) I could get help world wide.
I have taken the machine to an authorized repair workshop and they cannot fix it. If you have another facility that can fix it, thats great, but you can offer to send a shipping box to me where I am not to some country the computer originated in.  I have spent months trying to get help, only to have my time waisted, get hung up on, or not receive a return call. At this point we have been with out this NEW laptop for months and cannot receive any support or help from your company. I want to offer your organization one last oppertunity to make this issue correct. WE WANT A REPLACEMENT LAPTOP.
I tried to explain to the customer rep. that it would be far cheeper to just send a PO to our local HP outlet for a replacement machine, at the same time we can return the broken laptop and YOUR company can ship it to whoever to try and fix it. You are welcome to keep this damaged machine.
I am afraid at this point to even attempt to seek repair help on the second of the three machines purchased as this one also has issues affecting functionality, albeit not as critical as the computer in question which is completly dead, but still, its two machines out of three. First things first lets replace the documted broken MB with a new laptop please.
I await your prompt response and a streamlined, effective and customer satisifaction oreintated solution to this situation without further delay.

Hewlett-Packard Rodeo		In Reference To:   Service order BDTD0119-01
I received a replacement printer under my warranty.  When the technical supervisor submitted the order, I asked him how I can extend the warranty on the new printer.  He stated I would go to the following website, where I could order an extended warranty:   shopping.hp.com
I went to that website, and couldn’t quite determine what I was looking for, and given the amount of time I had spent between two phone calls to Technical Support, decided to contact HP via online chat.  I was connected with a service rep identified as “GraceP.” See chat log below.  I inquired about the extended warranty and provided the background information, including the order # for the replacement printer (BDTD0119-01)
GraceP conducted research into the matter, stated the prices and provided links to where I could purchase the extended warranty.  When I went to order the warranty, my customer account would not come up as my email address did not show as valid.  I sensed a problem and called customer/sales support.  The sales rep and his supervisor stated I would have to go through Technical Support for a warranty extension.  I stated that it was Technical Support that had me go to the shopping website, which led me to them. IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
I feel like I am getting the runaround from HP personnel on two different continents—please advise or provide information.
My wife received the printer this morning and when she set it up and attempted to put it into operation, she kept receiving carriage jammed errors.  She stated she followed the troubleshooting measures as best she could, and as of this writing, has spent a little more than one hour on the phone with Technical Support attempting to get this printer to work.
——————————————————–Questions———————————————————————
Can someone explain to me, why after I spent nearly 30-45 minutes on hold while the original service tech I contacted on Wednesday, and after I very passionately and loudly explained that I could continue to hold, and SHE SET UP an 11:00AM EST time for the Technical Supervisor to call my wife, no one at HP contacted my wife at the appointed day and time.  I had to call HP and go through the process of getting through to the Technical Supervisor.  Granted that call resulted in success, as he initiated the process to send out the replacement printer—it was just more time that is very precious to me.
Given the fact that my wife and I have spent at least 4 and a half hours on the phone talking with various representatives from two departments on two separate continents, and still don’t have a printer that works NOR a method or means to extend the warranty, can you think of any reason for me to continue purchasing HP products?
We’ve purchased at least three printers (all all in one, photosmart series over the years) and at least $2,000 USD in ink from HP.
Needless to say, my wife and I are not real pleased with Hewlett Packard right now.  In fact, you might say, that we are livid at Hewlett Packard at the moment.
It would extremely nice, if Hewlett Packard would:
A.  Help my wife put this newly received printer into operation, and
B.  Provide some correct information to either my wife or I as to how we can extend the warranty on this newly received, refurbished printer, and
C. Figure some way or gesture that might make believe that your firm practices what your leadership  surely preaches to the rank and file concerning customer service:  our customers are our most important asset, the customer is always right, we take pride in providing the highest degree of customer service,  blah, blah, blah.
Update as of Friday 11APR2014 1715 EST:   I wanted to email the above narrative to HP via the online website—as the submission form limited my input to 1000 characters, I called the sales support customer service contact number—explained the situation in detail to a rep named Brandi (SP).  She stated to call (888) 227-8454 and ask to speak with a case manager, who will be able to help me.  At that number the representative gave me yet another number to call to reach a case manager: (800) 474-6830.  When I called that number I received the same runaround, from a rep named Thomas—he asked me several questions, and wanted to put me through to a supervisor.  I explained in no uncertain terms, that I have already spoke with a Technical Support Supervisor and need to speak with a Case Manager—as described by Brandi.  Thomas asked me for the background on this issue.  He stated that I would have to wait until the current warranty expired before I could order a new warranty.  (This makes about the 3rd different version I’ve been told by HP personnel concerning this issue.  Thomas then wanted to know if the carriage jam had been cleared.  I explained for the 2d time, that I wasn’t with my wife and the printer and that because she has been on the phone with HP for the past three hours, and because I have not heard back from her, that NO I DON’T BELIEVE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  He then attempted to put me on hold in order to connect me to his supervisor—I adamantly explained that I’ve already spoken to a Technical Support Supervisor, and demand to speak with a Case Manager.  He put me on hold, and about 5 minutes later his supervisor, a man named Nick came on the line.  Nick wanted to hear the entire story, stating he needed to hear it from.  By now I was livid—I started to provide the data, and demanded to know why Thomas had not taken any notes to put into the case record so I would not have describe this entire ordeal—for about the third time in last hour and a half.  He stated that they don’t have a direct line to the case managers, and that someone would have to call me.  I explained that since one Technical Supervisor did not call my wife back at the agreed date and time, that I had absolutely no confidence that I would be receiving a call from anyone at Hewlett Packard.
I threatened to send  this entire narrative to Hewlett Packard’s corporate headquarters—either via
the corporate website.
Hopefully this will result in some sort of response–
Sincerely, 
Ronald P. Kerr

04/10/2014 11:08:56AM	 Session Started with Agent (Grace P)
04/10/2014 11:08:56AM	 Ronald Kerr: “How much would an extended warranty be for a HP 5514 e-All-in-One series printer?”
04/10/2014 11:08:59AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Thank you for contacting HP Home & Home Office Store Chat. My name is Grace. I’ve read your question so let’s get started.”
04/10/2014 11:09:10AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Hello, Ronald.”
04/10/2014 11:09:18AM	 Agent (Grace P): “We thank you for choosing HP. Do not worry, I will check this for you. But before anything else, I would like to wish you a fine and lovely Thursday.”
04/10/2014 11:09:30AM	 Agent (Grace P): “By the way, is your printer still within its base warranty?”
04/10/2014 11:11:16AM	 Ronald Kerr: “Yes–we are receiving a refurbished printer from HP tomorrow, the warranty will remain in place until 14 Dec 2014 (the end of the warranty on the printer that died). I just want to know how much it would cost and the deadline for purchasing an extended warranty for the inbound printer (HP 5514 Photosmart e-all in one)
04/10/2014 11:12:26AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Thank you for that clarification, Ronald.”
04/10/2014 11:12:33AM	 Agent (Grace P): “I can definitely check this out for you.”
04/10/2014 11:12:40AM	 Agent (Grace P): “About your concern, please give me a minute to check on the information for you.”
04/10/2014 11:14:03AM	 Agent (Grace P): “While I am checking for the information, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to enroll in our My Print Rewards Program. You will save 10% everyday on ink purchases after your first qualifying order, which is a $30 purchase. As always, you get free next day shipping to your door on all original HP supplies! It is free. You may check this URL to sign up: shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/my-print-rewards/Start
04/10/2014 11:14:46AM	 Ronald Kerr: “The order # for the replacement printer is BDTD0119-01. I don’t want to purchase right now–I just want to know how much it would cost and when I need to extend the warranty. The Tech Supervisor who completed the transaction stated I could go to the web”
 	site http://www.shopping.hp.com –where I could find out purchasing information for such a product.
04/10/2014 11:15:20AM	 Agent (Grace P): “I am checking this now for you. Please bear with me.”
04/10/2014 11:16:11AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Ronald, thanks for holding.”
04/10/2014 11:16:29AM	 Agent (Grace P): “As I checked, you do have two options for the carepack that you can purchase for your printer. Here are the details below:”
04/10/2014 11:16:38AM	 Ronald Kerr: “I guess my idea is, if the extended warranty costs say $30-50 for at least two years it may be worth it. If the cost is say $100 or more, it would be more cost efeective to simply by a new printer”
04/10/2014 11:18:09AM	 Agent (Grace P): “You can purchase the HP 2 year Care Pack w/Next Day Exchange for Printers.”
04/10/2014 11:18:23AM	 Agent (Grace P): “This is only for $24.99.”
04/10/2014 11:18:31AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Here is the page:”
04/10/2014 11:18:33AM	 Agent (Grace P): “shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Care_Packs/Care-Packs-for-Printers/UG605A?HP-2-year-Care-Pack-w-Next-Day-Exchange-for-Printers”
04/10/2014 11:18:45AM	 Agent (Grace P): “And, the HP 3 year Care Pack w/Next Day Exchange for Printers for only $34.99. Here is the page:”
04/10/2014 11:18:47AM	 Agent (Grace P): “shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Care_Packs/Care-Packs-for-Printers/UG608A?HP-3-year-Care-Pack-w-Next-Day-Exchange-for-Printers”
04/10/2014 11:19:22AM	 Ronald Kerr: “Do I have until the end of the current warranty to make the decision–sounds like the 3-yr Care Pack would be worth it.”
04/10/2014 11:19:29AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Also, as long as the printer is still within its warranty, you have the chance to purchase the extended warranty, considering there is no defect of the printer until you purchased it.”
04/10/2014 11:19:56AM	 Agent (Grace P): “No, you have to purchase it within the base warranty of the printer.”
04/10/2014 11:20:16AM	 Agent (Grace P): “The Extended Service Plan starts at the date of delivery of the product like (computer or printer), it does not start at the date of purchased of the Extended Service Plan. That is why it is highly recommended that they purchased the Extended Service Plan” together with the product (computer or printer) so that they can enjoy full coverage in terms of technical concerns since the standard manufacturer’s warranty is not exactly a full technical support.
04/10/2014 11:21:18AM	 Ronald Kerr: “Okay, so I’m receiving a replacement printer tomorrow–should I purchase the Extended Service Plan today or tomorrow (as the coverage begins the day the product is shipped)?”
04/10/2014 11:21:36AM 	Agent (Grace P): “You can purchase it tomorrow if you want, Ronald.”
04/10/2014 11:22:00AM	 Agent (Grace P): “Should you go ahead and purchase the carepack now”
04/10/2014 11:23:14AM	 Agent (Grace P): “While I still have you, I would also like to take this opportunity to inform you that we are having a special deal on most of our HP products. Please purchase any HP item that comes with a subtotal of $75 on your cart for you to get $15 off. Just use coup” on code SUPER2014 at checkout.

04/10/2014 11:23:15AM	 Agent (Grace P): “When you are ready to make the purchase, one of the best resources that we have to place your order is our Sales Center.

I bought a Pavilion TouchSmart 23 computer Sept. 4, 2013. Since that time I’ve had nothing but trouble. I’ve contacted your HP Total Care and have gotten the runaround. They tried to sell me protection, they constantly lied by telling me there was nothing wrong with the computer. They told me to restore to Factory Setting, but do not install Windows 8.1, because they were having issues. They kept telling me that I have a case number and would get back to me ASAP, but after I waited a couple of days and nothing happened, they said that they were having a electronic ‘glitch’ which sounded very phony. I have had to email them several times between Feb. 22, and Feb. 28. The response was usually that I’d hear from them soon. Their idea of soon is non-existent. I could go on and on, but I’m sure others have had the same kinds of problems that I’ve had. I believe that I have a useless computer and it should be considered under our Lemon Law. I either want a new computer, or full reimbursement.

first printer was replaced. second had issues from day one but I lived with the notice, shaking, missed paper pick up, not shutting down. After a tech assist, Got a phone offer a 3 yr care pack warranty . I b ought it. Issues continued and called tech support, nothing was done and I said forget it, and used it as it was Finaly called tech, they could not find prior notes adn told me the whole tech support process needed to be done over again….a tech walking me thru testing the unit. I said no, no more. It was escalated to a case mgr authorizing replacement unit. I was to be phoned at 9am  next morning or following morning. Bot mornings passed an I was late to work. I called HP  finally got the right dept.  was told to select a printer within a price range. no problem. teh replace ment would be received in 5 days !!!!!!
% friggin days. when I took out the care pack warranty, i was told repairs or replacement would be next day service.
Now I have a case mgr who knows nothing about that and if did not like the 5 day delivery then I was to keep the printer i was using an deal with it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HP ,should only know where they stick their care packs, managerial attitudes and mis- information.
Don’t get me started on ink cartridges that all have to be replaced when the black is empty—–THE FIRST TIME.. So, to replace the black for the first time, I had to buy black and 3 colors.. (EVEN THOUGH I USE GRAY SCALE ONLY) No where in the manual or box was this hidden/devious expense indicated.
They may put in print that customer service is a priority but their actions indicate otherwise.
Now, I have to wait 5 business days to get a replacement printer

Hello.  On Dec 4, 2011, I purchased a dv6t Select ed laptop from you hp website.  Order #H120509915 for $1049.99.  I also purchased a 3yr pickup and rtn/ADP Lojack (HG170B) package for 217.49. 
The laptop\\\’s fan is not functioning properly and shuts down after a warning message. I call 800-407-4005 for tech support.  The issue was not able to be resolved.(45 mins)  I was unable to access computer to down load new BIOs update due my not knowing my son\\\’s password. I forwarded the email receipt from 12/4/11 to hp.pop@mail.support.hp.com.
Tech support kindly called back when my son was home.  The issue was not resolved and tech support recommended sending laptop in for fan replacement.
I was transferred to a supervisor because the 3 yr pickup and return warranty could not be verified.  This was the case with the first call I made. This took 69 mins.
The only issue I have is the 3yr warrant I purchased.  I have the email I was sent of this purchase and bank statement showing where I was charged for this purchased. However, no one can located this purchase in you computer files. Now reason would dictate that your computer files are not my responsibility to maintain or insure its accuracy. I was charged for this warranty as indicated by the above mention order number and my bank records.  I seen two reasonably alternatives. 1. Honor the warranty.  2. Refund my money for a produce that you are not going to honor.  I will take the second alternative as a buyer beware scenario and shame on me. 
Just prior to this incident, I was close to purchasing you Phoenix desktop system for my son\\\’s birthday; however, I will have to wait and see.
Thank you

I am dissatisfied wit HP, the customer service is awful, and the tech support is the same. My laptop had a virus, and I called HP. They remoted into my computer. Several times we were disconnected, and had to keep calling back. They said they woukd bill me $14.95 a month. Instead they withdrew 210.00 the next day, without my permission. I called the company and was giving several people to call. Each extension was incorrect. They wouldn’t give a fax number. Horrible service, and I’m never buying this product again.. Buyer Beware…..
