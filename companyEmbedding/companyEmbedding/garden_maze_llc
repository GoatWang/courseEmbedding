A-MAZE-N-PRODUCTS   Home > SMOKERS
































The 6x6 A-MAZE-N-SMOKER(AMNS)PATENTED is a light weight, durable and portable smoke
generator, that produces a great quality smoke for cold and hot smoking.
	 It is versatile enough to be used in just
about any smoker or a grill.
	The
Original A-MAZE-N-SMOKER was designed to burn sawdust for cold smoking, but
customers quickly found is useful at higher temps up to 180°.
	

 The A-MAZE-N-PELLET-SMOKER(AMNPS)PATENTED
is also a light weight, durable and portable smoke generator, but it’s designed
to burn pellets or sawdust.
The new
AMNPS will produce smoke during cold smoking and hot smoking, tested up to
275°!




The latest addition to my smoking arsenal is the A-MAZE-N-TUBE-SMOKER(AMNTS)PATENTED  The AMNTS uses the very same materials as my other smokers, but it's in the shape of a tube.  It was designed to burn pellets and supplement smoke at higher temps, in Pellet Grills/Smokers.  This is where most pellet grills/smokers do not produce much smoke.  The AMNTS adds additional smoke at cooking temps, regardless if your pellet grill/smoker is burning pellets or not. 


 It can also be used in many other types of smokers or grills, where grate space is limited.  Just like the other smokers we sell, the AMNTS will produce great smoke for cold smoking as well.  The 12" AMNTS will burn up to 4 hours, depending on the smoker temps, type of pellets and draft inside your smoker.

Garden Mazes Create a Sense of Wonder






    Explore the art of maze and labyrinth makers.
























Garden Labyrinth


It might look like a maze but this is actually a labyrinth created by Suzman Design Associates. If it was a maze, the hedges would be too high to see over the pathways.

Mazes and labyrinths have been prominent components of European gardens and estates for centuries but they are now gaining popularity in the U.S. Either form brings something magical and compelling to a landscape design but there is a distinct difference between the two.




A maze is a puzzle with a choice of pathways and dead-ends designed to confuse and challenge the explorer. Garden mazes are usually created with tall hedges that you cannot see over or see through, making it difficult to navigate your way from the entrance to the exit. One of the most famous examples of this is the maze at Hampton Court Palace in England.




A labyrinth, on the other hand, is designed with a single, non-branching path which leads to the center. Architect Stephen Suzman, who has designed several labyrinths for clients, states that "a labyrinth is basically a pattern on the ground that is low and could be made up of something as simple as two different types of stone or grass and stone or very low hedges."

















For Kids of All Ages


This labyrinth of brick and pavers was a collaboration between Suzman Design Associates and Thomas Hacker and Associates for a school. Labyrinths are quite popular with children who are engaged by the design and interact naturally with it.

This labyrinth of brick and pavers was a collaboration between Suzman Design Associates and Thomas Hacker and Associates for a school. Labyrinths are quite popular with children who are engaged by the design and interact naturally with it.





While mazes test your deductive reasoning, labyrinths serve a different purpose. "Labyrinths were designed to concentrate the mind," Suzman says, and are "more of a progression to a center, sort of like a walking meditation. There are labyrinths in places like Chartres where they have religious and meditative functions." An American example would be the Labyrinths of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, which are open to the public as a place to reflect, pray or meditate.




Of the two forms, labyrinths offer more options on what materials you use to create them. Gravel, sand, rocks, tiles, bricks, pavers and low-growing vegetation are some of the many choices available. A traditional garden maze, however, requires hedges or shrubbery that can grow to heights of 6 feet or more and would require much more maintenance. Among the more popular and hardy plants used by maze designers are yew, boxwood and yaupon holly. Suzman adds, "You could use beech or hornbeam. It would be deciduous in mazes but they could certainly be very effective." Clumping bamboo is another alternative.

Lost in Yew


Composed of more than 16,000 English yews, the Longleat Hedge Maze, located near the town of Warminster in Wiltshire, England, is a stunning creation that was first laid out in 1975 by the renowned designer Greg Bright.

Misty Maze


This impressive hedgerow maze is located behind the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg and is popular with children who like to get lost within its 6-foot tall walls.

Bird's Eye View


Modeled on the famous maze at the Hampton Court Palace, the Governor's Palace maze in Colonial Williamsburg was restored in 1999-2000 with yaupon holly replacing the less vigorous American holly.

Find the Clue


Every year the Davis Mega Maze in Sterling, Massachusetts presents a different theme with its corn maze. This past year the elaborate design by Adrian Fisher was based on the popular board game Clue and required participants solve a number of mysteries and puzzles while moving through the maze.

Green Puzzle


The Garden Maze at Luray Caverns challenges visitors to discover the secret of the maze through a series of twists, turns and tunnels.

Maze Explorers


A group of brave adventurers enter the Garden Maze at Luray Caverns in Virginia, which is composed of over 1,500 dark American arborvitae that stand eight feet high.

John, Paul, Ringo and George


A corn maze tribute to The Beatles? Yes, the 50th anniversary of The Beatles' U.S. debut was the theme of this unique 2013 tribute at the Richardson Adventure Farm and Corn Maze in Spring Grove, Illinois. The popular tourist attraction included four separate mazes that winded through 33 acres of cornfields.

Aerial Artistry


The Longleat Hedge Maze in England is part of the 8,000 acres that belong to the historic 1541 estate of the Marquesses of Bath. The maze is considered the longest, but not the largest, one in the world and covers 1.48 acres and 1.69 miles of pathway.

Raised Expectations


Visitors to the Longleat Hedge Maze take advantage of the observation tower and elevated bridges to try to figure out how to maneuver their way through the pathways.

Pineapple Fantasy


Billed as the world's largest maze, the Dole Plantation Garden Maze in Hawaii extends over three acres and includes pathways crafted from 14,000 colorful native plants.

Contemplating Perfection


Designed as a place of meditation, The Harmonist Labyrinth in New Harmony, Indiana was reconstructed between 1939-1940 with privet hedge on the site of the original design. The Harmonists believe that the labyrinth symbolizes the difficult path of life to reach true perfection.

Hidden Fountain


If you make it to the center of the Garden Maze at Luray Caverns, you'll discover a refreshing surprise. This one-acre ornamental garden is open year round on weekends, weather permitting.

Corny Complexity


Every year The Amazing Maize Maze at Cherry Crest Adventure Farm in Ronk, Pennsylvania creates a new theme for its interactive 5-acre corn maze and this aerial photograph displays their 2011 theme, "Once Upon a Time."

Engage the Mind


This labyrinth design by Stephen Suzman of Suzman Design Associates displays the aesthetic difference between a labyrinth and a maze. "Labyrinths were designed to concentrate the mind," says Suzman, and are "more of a progression to a center, sort of like a walking meditation." A maze, on the other hand, requires hedges or vegetation that are tall and prevent you from seeing through them, which creates a sense of mystery.

The Amazing Maize Maze


This overview of the corn maze at Cherry Crest Farm gives you some idea of the unique and creative agricultural experience awaiting visitors during its active season between May and October.

Lost in Space


Can you find the flying saucer in this corn maze? This photograph from 2000 showcases the theme of that year's maze exhibition at Cherry Crest Adventure Farm: "Lost in Space."

High as an Elephant's Eye


Corn mazes can be even more challenging than hedge mazes since the corn can grow to heights of ten feet or more and even viewing your location from an elevated bridge is no guarantee you can figure out how to get out of the maze. These intrepid explorers at the Cherry Crest Adventure Farm are armed with a flag that they can signal for help if they get lost.








    
        Photo By: Image courtesy of Cathy Kornfield
    
    















The Dino King


The age of the dinosaurs was the theme at Marini Farm in Ipswich, Massachusetts, for the 2013 season and if you look closely, you can see the head of a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the corn maze design. 








    
        Photo By: Image courtesy of Marini Farm
    
    
















In recent years, corn mazes have become increasingly popular in farming areas and there are several commercial operations that transform their cornfields into elaborate mazes every year with specific themes. Larry Davis of Davis Family Farm Adventures in Sterling, Massachusetts uses world famous maze designer Adrian Fisher to design their seasonal corn maze with themes like the board game Clue. An aerial view of the maze reveals a giant question mark in the center of a network of intricate puzzles, dead-ends and observation bridges placed strategically throughout the exhibition. 




One striking aspect of the Davis Mega Maze is that it isn't completely created out of corn stalks and is supplemented by sorghum-sudangrass. "It grows very tall and gives a jungle effect to the maze," Davis said. "It makes the pathways look super lush. You really can't see through them well at all." The Davis Mega Maze also offers a flashlight experience that challenges visitors to navigate the twists and turns of their eight-acre corn sculpture under the night sky. 




For more information about mazes and labyrinths, check out Mazes and Labyrinths of the World by Janet Bord (E.P. Dutton & Co., 1976) and Mazes and Labyrinths by W.H. Mathews (Longman, Green and Co., 1922). The Labyrinth Society is also a good internet resource.

What can I do if my compost is too wet?Daniel Vilinsky2017-05-11T02:20:59+00:00 
What can I do if my compost is too wet?



To correct wet compost we recommend reducing the amount of green waste (fruit, vegetable, kitchen scraps) and increasing the percentage of brown waste (dry grass, leaves, paper).
Generally the mix should be 50/50 however in the case of wet compost it is necessary to increase the percentage of brown waste temporarily in order to get the mixture balanced again.
Once the mixture is moist (without being wet) it will be possible to revert to a 50/50 composition.
Exposure to sunlight and increased aeration are also helpful in getting the compost back to its correct balance.
 




Can Maze greenhouses be fixed to a concrete slab?Daniel Vilinsky2015-07-20T02:25:35+00:00 
Can Maze greenhouses be fixed to a concrete slab?



All of our Greenhouses can be fixed to a concrete slab. Each greenhouse has multiple openings on its base to accommodate fixings. We suggest using 10mm dyno bolts.




Is it safe to store drinking water in your tanks?Daniel Vilinsky2017-05-11T02:19:45+00:00 
Is it safe to store drinking water in your tanks?



The following tanks have been constructed from virgin polyethylene and are therefore classified as food grade and suitable for storing drinking water:

100lt MINItank
190lt MINItank





Are your greenhouses wheelchair accessible?Daniel Vilinsky2015-07-20T01:31:02+00:00 
Are your greenhouses wheelchair accessible?



To ensure wheelchair accessibility we recommend our 8 x 12 greenhouse as it does not have a raised “kicker” at the entry which is a feature of our 6′ range of greenhouses. It has also been designed with wide double doors to give more clearance on the sides.




Do you offer Australia wide delivery?Daniel Vilinsky2017-05-11T02:21:35+00:00 
Do you offer Australia wide delivery?



We offer Australia wide delivery on most of our products (including greenhouses).




Do UV panels prevent plants from photosynthesizing effectively?Daniel Vilinsky2015-07-20T01:31:13+00:00 
Do UV panels prevent plants from photosynthesizing effectively?



Actually the opposite is true given that UV light damages plants cells. Plants cannot use energy in the UV range to facilitate photosynthesis. They use light from either the red or blue wavelengths for this.




Can Maze Greenhouses withstand strong winds?Daniel Vilinsky2017-05-11T02:22:55+00:00 
Can Maze Greenhouses withstand strong winds?



All Maze Greenhouses have been tested for wind speeds of up to 75km p/h.
This can be increased to 90km/h with the aid of the Maze Anchoring Kit: http://mazedistribution.com.au/product/anchor-kit/

About UsDaniel Vilinsky2016-08-19T02:25:39+00:00 
Founded in mid 2004, Maze Distribution’s goal from the outset was to bring quality home and gardening products to the Australian public.
More than a decade later Maze continues to lead the market in new and innovative solutions for everyday gardening and household needs.
On this website you will find the full range of Maze branded products. These include greenhouses, a wide selection of quality, unique composting products, MINItanks, vertical gardens, sheds and more.
In addition to our range of Maze products we are also proud to supply many of Australia’s premier retailers with a wider variety of home and garden products. These products include a substantial range from Keter Plastics (World’s largest exporter of resin home & garden products) and span categories such as storage, shelving, cabinets, leisure, kid’s play and much much more.
Our suppliers are as varied as the products themselves. As it stands we currently import from countries including The UK, Germany, Canada, Israel, Taiwan, New Zealand, China and others. We also proudly buy and manufacture certain items in Australia like our MINItanks and some composting items.
Here at Maze we are excited about all the future possibilities.
