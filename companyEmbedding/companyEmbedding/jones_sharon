 100 Days, 100 Nights CD music Product Description

100 Days, 100 Nights album for sale by Sharon Jones / Sharon Jones & The Dapkings was released Oct 02, 2007 on the Daptone label. Despite beginning her career in her 40s, Brooklyn-based singer Sharon Jones has been bringing true biscuits-&-gravy soul to the table as if she's been doing it since the day she was born. On her third album for the Daptone label, 100 DAYS, 100 NIGHTS, Jones, who's backed here by label house band the Dap-Kings (also the touring band for British neo-soulstress Amy Winehouse), rips through a set of deep '60s-inspired funk and R&B that sounds anachronistic in all the right ways. 100 Days, 100 Nights CD music is a 2-disc set with 17 songs.   ...See Full Description


 100 Days, 100 Nights buy CD music Product Reviews

Rolling Stone (p.78) - 3 stars out of 5 -- [With] some of the finest horn charts ever created for soul music -- funky, jazzy, subtly voiced things that compare to Pee Wee Ellis' trickiest writing for James Brown."Spin (p.106) - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- "[Sharon Jones' songs] sound old and new, wiggly and sexual, raw and cooked..."Entertainment Weekly (p.64) - "[T]he Dap-Kings' slower, moodier template gives Jones' voice the space it needs to soar." -- Grade: A-Uncut (p.98) - 3 stars out of 5 -- "The Dap Kings' Southern Soul simulation is in high demand these days....It's all impeccably done..."Magnet (p.101) - "This is a retro soul act with songs that are more than just horn-and-rhythm showcases. Some feature sly major-to-minor transitions and guitar solos..."Down Beat (p.62) - 3 stars out of 5 -- "[With] hook-laden tunes that often sound like newly discovered Motown or Invictus Records sessions."Living Blues (p.62) - "100 DAYS, 100 NIGHTS opens with the cascading horns of the title track before the funk-drenched rhythm section and Jones' rich vocal wash over the ears in vintage analog glory."No Depression (p.102) - "Jones and the Dap-Kings reproduce the sounds and the soul feeling of Motown and James Brown...[with] funky ease and gospel fervor and emotional complexity..."Q (Magazine) (p.121) - 3 stars out of 5 -- "[Jones is a] gospel-raised New Yorker with a voice like a tornado..."

                    This option is available for our in-stock and special order items.  Simply order online and drive to one of our store/warehouse locations to pick up your order.  Due to the limited availability and specific qualities of our special order products, NFM must assess a 25% non-refundable deposit.  This deposit must be made with a major credit or debit card.  We offer an option that allows you to use your Nebraska Furniture Mart Card for the remainder of the balance.  To complete an order this way, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.

                    On your scheduled delivery date, you’ll be given a 2-hour time window that you can expect to receive your delivery. Our drivers can also call ahead of time if it has been requested. With Driveway Delivery, our delivery drivers will place your items on the nearest sidewalk, driveway, or inside your garage.

At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include the setup of Ready to Assemble products. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page.  If you have any questions about assembly please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.

 Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones CD music Product Description

Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones album for sale by Sharon Jones was released Sep 13, 2005 on the CD Baby label. This fabulous entertainer was born in Portsmouth, NH. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones buy CD music Portsmouth called her the pride of Portsmouth. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones songs As a child she knew she wanted to be a professional singer. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones album for sale Sharon is most definitely what she set out to be. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones CD music Sharon is a world call artist. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones buy CD music Sharon traveled extensively with the world renowned jazz organist Johnny Hammond Smith and Houston Person. Many Styles Of: Sharon Jones songs After touring she settled in Los angeles where she studied privately with a vacal coach from the Sullivan School of Music and did studio work as a backup vocalist. As an entertainer Sharon can be only thrilling at her worst and absolutely electrifying at he best. Once again, it's a case of world-caliber performer who hasn't received that kind of recognition by the world. Only the tens of thousands who have heard her live, in concert or in jazz rooms know. Her audiences ranged from Baltimore to Seattle, from New York to Los Angeles, from Boston to Canada. Sharon is Aretha, Ella, Anita Baker and Tina Turner rolled into one. Sharon sings jazz, blues, R&B, show tunes and even a little country music and makes it all sound extraordinary. Sharon Jones is not just a singer, she is a dynamic entertainer. She is what show business is all about. She runs the listener through all the gamuts of emotion. She is warm and gentle. She can also be a majestic lioness at times. I've seen audiences opening weeping during her rendition of, "This Is My Life." Sharon currently has her own jazz band, funk band as well as a more quiet jazz ensemble. Sharon also takes gigs fronting other bands. This is one classy and soulful lady!

Dap-Kings' Gabriel Roth recalls Sharon Jones' last days: 'She didn't want to stop singing'

Randall RobertsContact Reporter




Soul singer Sharon Jones, who died Friday at age 60 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, didn’t find commercial success until she was well into her 40s.When she did, it was through her work with her longtime band the Dap-Kings. They backed Jones for nearly two decades, and were by her bedside when she died.
She was the strongest person any of us had ever known, and she just kept singing. She didn't want to stop singing.
— The Dap-Kings' Gabriel Roth on Sharon Jones' last days

Jones, Roth said in an interview Saturday, suffered a stroke on Nov. 8 — election night -- as she was watching the returns. He immediately flew to Cooperstown N.Y., where she was in the hospital, and summoned the rest of the band. “She told the people that were there that Trump gave her the stroke,” said Roth, laughing.

“She didn't seem anxious or scared or anything. She just wanted to sing, you know, and every time there was a lull in the room she would start moaning some kind of gospel song,” he said. Here, Roth remembers the pain, and transcendent beauty, of Jones’ last days.The announcement of Sharon’s death said that the Dap-Kings were with her when she died. Can you talk about that?Well, she’d been fighting fighting cancer for a few years now, and there’s been all kinds of stuff coming at her. But the thing that actually got her in the last couple of weeks was, she had a stroke watching the election results. After that first stroke she couldn't move her leg, but she could still talk. 

I flew out and met her up in the hospital in Cooperstown, and I saw her and she told the people that were there that Trump gave her the stroke. She was blaming Trump for the whole thing.
The thing that actually got her in the last couple of weeks was, she had a stroke watching the election results.
— Gabriel Roth

Unfortunately -- that was on on Tuesday night, and then on Wednesday while we were there she had another stroke. After that, she couldn't talk or really respond anymore.I called the band right away and everybody came up, and her family came up. She was surrounded by her real close loved ones. Was music involved?Binky [Griptite, a Dap-Kings member] started to play the guitar and she started humming along. It was kind of remarkable. She was just moaning at first, and then she was moaning in tune and then she started following chord changes and pretty soon she was humming "His Eye on the Sparrow" with him.We all just kept playing and singing with her, and little by little over the next couple of days she actually started moving her mouth and started singing lyrics. She just wanted to sing these gospel songs. Every time we'd stop, she’d just keep singing -- “Amazing Grace” and “Go Tell It On the Mountain,” “This Little Light of Mine.” We just stayed with her and sang with her and played music with her.Was she aware of her surroundings?She still couldn't talk, and couldn't answer questions, but that part of her that's singing, that part of her that made music and that loved music and that was musical just didn't want to go. It was just so strong.

And, you know, it was very sad, but it was also very beautiful and kind of amazing to see that. I mean, she was the strongest person any of us had ever known, and she just kept singing. She didn't want to stop singing.That was really beautiful, really beautiful, and I'm really glad that the band had a chance to spend that last musical moment with her and sing with her.The whole band was there?Oh geez. [Counts] I mean, it was the whole band now. So that was nine plus [backing vocalists] Saun and Starr -- that's 11. [Lists other behind-the-scenes personnel]. Fourteen. People were coming and going. Other friends and family were coming and going the whole time. Over that whole week there was a lot of people there. And she would smile and she would laugh at jokes and she'd look around and she seemed really happy to have everybody around her.She didn't seem anxious or scared or anything. She just wanted to sing, you know, and every time there was a lull in the room she would start moaning some kind of gospel song or something and we'd very quietly come in behind her and play guitar. Or Saundra and Starr were singing harmonies with her. And it was crazy. Even in that state -- if you asked her if she was in pain, she couldn't respond.  She couldn't say one word, or say somebody's name or anything.But she could find harmony notes with Saun and Starr, and sing three-part harmony and improvise these gospel moans. It was really remarkable, and it was beautiful. I've never seen anything like it.
