Highlights
 
Unlock productivity and accelerate onboarding
 
Focused on a business user’s needs, the award-winning SAP Fiori 2.0 extends the personalized paradigm of the SAP Fiori user experience, enabling easier onboarding and greater productivity. The SAP Fiori launchpad is evolving into a “viewport,” a personalized landing page with ready access to individual notifications and profile information. 
 
From a single point of entry, each user can see his or her task list, key performance indicators, and access apps through tiles, links, or search. The SAP S/4HANA 1610 release has a single visual design across all applications making it easier for your workforce to transition between daily activities.   
 
Accelerate digital transformation
 
The SAP S/4HANA 1610 release includes new functional, usability, and integration enhancements which expand on existing innovations and allow customers to accelerate their digital transformation journeys with IT landscapes that are more simple and flexible.
 
Supply chains can perform better with increased agility—resulting in lower lead times, better customer service and higher profitability. Key innovations include SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) and Production Planning and Detailed Schedule (PPDS) in the core, eliminating potentially complex integrations.
 
The 1610 release also includes the full scope of SAP S/4HANA Finance. Companies can now take complete advantage of new capabilities such as transfer pricing, parallel valuation, soft close, and prediction.
 
Additional innovations across lines of business include Integrated Quality Management, Embedded Software in Product Development, and Optimized Portfolio and Project Management among many others.
 
Leverage key industry functionality in the core
 
The new SAP S/4HANA 1610 release allows organizations to meet specific industry needs in the digital economy. For example, not only has Retail Merchandise Management been completely re-architected to take advantage of SAP HANA, it is now also available for customers in other industries who have retail operations.
 
Oil and Gas customers can take advantage of upstream and downstream functions that have been optimized for the SAP HANA platform as well as a real-time insight and the flexibility to better meet customer needs.

Your needs are at the heart of everything we do




Life Assurance & Income Protection




ISAs & Investment Planning




Pensions & Retirement




Corporate Advice




Estate Planning








Life Assurance & Income Protection
Let's Talk

'Everyone can benefit from having a little extra security'
Jon Perry, Independent Financial Adviser




								Whatever your stage in life it is always important to consider whether you have fully planned for the future. Do you have sufficient savings should you be unable to work due to a lengthy period of illness? Could you afford to pay for the medical and rehabilitation bills resulting from a serious illness? Have you considered securing a source of income or capital for your loved ones should you pass away? It is important to understand that in all of these situations help and support from the state is limited. Without proper planning the wrong decision may result in financial hardship.  

Ae Financial Services has access to the full range of insurance companies and solutions. We assess all aspects of your current financial situation and needs, before making recommendations about the most suitable contract, level of protection and insurer for you.


Life & Critical Illness

												Financial protection for you and your family in the event of death and critical illness.											


Income Protection

												Protect your income should you be unable to work due to sickness or incapacity. 											


Private Medical Insurance

												Provides access to quality and affordable medical care without waiting on the NHS.											




'Everyone can benefit from having a little extra security'
Jon Perry, Independent Financial Adviser









ISAs & Investment Planning
Let's Talk

'It’s your money, make it work for you'
David Hayward, Chartered Financial Planner




								Our investment committee meets quarterly to discuss the performance, volatility and long-term outlook for our preferred investment groups. The discussions result from our continued analysis of both the global macro economy and the individual portfolios we choose, through the use of software such as Morningstar Adviser Workstation as well as regular face-to-face meetings with the providers. 

Following this, our in-house investment team are able to create portfolios for clients which are diversified across asset and geographic classes. We also take into consideration their attitude to investment risk and any ethical preference. Most importantly, these investments must serve the purpose they were intended for – be it income, capital growth or a combination. 

Some of our  investment partners include:






































ISAs

												Pay less tax on your investment returns by investing annually in an ISA.											


Investments

												Build a diverse portfolio aimed at protecting and growing your capital. 											




'It’s your money, make it work for you'
David Hayward, Chartered Financial Planner









Pensions & Retirement
Let's Talk

'Working with you to deliver sustainable income in retirement'
Andy Dixon, Independent Financial Adviser




								It is important to start planning for retirement as early as possible. Pensions are a key element of this and often form the main source of retirement income.

You have been able to withdraw part of your pension plan as a tax free lump sum for some time, alongside taking taxable income from it. However, since April 2015 the changes to pension death benefits mean they can now play a central role in long-term estate planning. Their flexible structure also facilitates investment in a wide variety of assets.

Whether you are an individual or an employer, we can help you plan for retirement in a way that is most appropriate to you and your circumstances. 


Personal Pensions

												Provides significant tax concessions and are an essential part of retirement and estate planning. 											


SIPP/SSAS

												Designed for individuals and businesses offering tax planning and extensive investment opportunities.											




'Working with you to deliver sustainable income in retirement'
Andy Dixon, Independent Financial Adviser









Corporate Advice
Let's Talk

'By working with us, you can have more time to focus on the things that really matter to your business'
James Henley, Independent Financial Adviser




								Having spent many years working closely with businesses, solicitors and accountants, our firm has extensive experience of the issues you may encounter. 

Whether you are looking for advice on workplace pensions and insurance schemes, making sure your business is financially protected in the event of death or illness of a key member of staff, or using your assets to assist with business expansion goals, our expert advisers build long-term corporate relationships through face-to-face meetings, telephone and back office support, alongside regular reviews.


Company Pensions

												Comply with current legislation by setting up and maintaining a workplace pension scheme. 											


Business Protection

												Protect your business in the event of death or sickness through continuity and succession planning. 											




'By working with us, you can have more time to focus on the things that really matter to your business'
James Henley, Independent Financial Adviser









Estate Planning
Let's Talk

'There are a range of solutions available to help in reducing inheritance tax'
James Henley, Independent Financial Adviser




								We understand that planning for the future can be a daunting and complex process. However, it is important to have your affairs arranged so you can pass assets on to those closest to you at a time of your choosing.

With careful, ongoing and flexible planning that has a focus on your individual circumstances, we are able to make recommendations that match your objectives. By taking into account your entire financial position you can be left secure in the knowledge that your estate will be passed-on according to your wishes. 


'There are a range of solutions available to help in reducing inheritance tax'

You are in: Home  » Why Us  »  About Us About UsAbove everything else, we never lose sight of the premise that our prosperity is directly linked to yours.
AE Finance Ltd was established in Peterborough nearly 25 years ago by its Managing Director, Salim R Ebrahim FCCA. It not only provides clients with the standard accountancy, audit and taxation services, but also business support and advice, wealth retention, wealth management and strategies for tax planning and mitigation.
AE Finance Limited is able to provide clients with the personal touch.  We have a reputation for our high standards and our fine attention to detail. 
Our dedicated team of qualified client managers and staff members are ready to respond to your requirements. The aim is to offer a pro-active, practical and timely service tailored to the needs of Individuals, Sole Traders, Partnerships, Trusts and Companies.
Our registration with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants requires us to adopt specific professional standards, which are centrally monitored to ensure compliance. In addition, the Association has introduced a quality assurance accreditation, granted only upon completion of a satisfactory inspection of a firm's quality assurance procedures and professional standards.
In 2003 AE Finance Ltd was awarded the ACCA Quality Checked seal after a rigorous inspection of our existing procedures, becoming one of the few ACCA practitioners then holding this kitemark. We regard this recognition of �best practice' as a significant achievement, and will maintain and indeed improve this level of service, to make quality the hallmark of our practice.  A further visit in 2009 not only re-confirmed the standards maintained but recognised further improvements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
