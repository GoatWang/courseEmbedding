Investors are overreacting to poor returns at the Hollywood box office

Jul. 20, 2017 at 9:23 a.m. ET
by Trey Williams









IMAX shares fall more than 5% leading film exhibitors down in disappointing summer movie season
Film exhibitors continue to experience stock declines as the summer movie season has gotten off to a rough start. Shares of Imax Corp.  were down more than 5%, leading the exhibitor space downward, with AMC Entertainment Holding Inc.  shares falling nearly 4% and shares of Cinemark Holdings Inc. and Marcus Corp.  falling slightly. Regal Entertainment Group shares were up less than 1%. The declines follow a Tuesday selloff that came after the 4-day Memorial Day holiday weekend had the lowest gross in 18 years. "Although Imax has the benefit of global exposure and more local content than the pure play exhibitors, their business is still focused on major blockbuster films and, with a number of those underperforming as of late, we would not be surprised if incremental concerns over near-term results and negative leverage on the model on weaker box office results is causing the selling pressure," B. Riley analyst Eric Wold said. The summer box office, so far through the season, is down 4.7% compared with last year's gross during the same time frame. Shares of the S&P 500 index  were down slightly in intraday trade on Wednesday.

Movie theater stocks suffer after a disappointing Memorial Day weekend at the box office
Shares of movie exhibitors and theater chain operators were down Tuesday after the box office suffered its lowest 4-day Memorial Day weekend draw in 18 years. AMC Entertainment Corp.  led the decline, falling nearly 5%, while IMAX Corp.  fell 4%, Cinemark Holdings Inc.  fell more than 2% and Marcus Corp.  fell 2%. Regal Entertainment Group's  was less severe, falling less than 1%. The box office brought in an estimated $179.0 million over the 4-day weekend, which is the lowest gross for the typically busy weekend since 1999, said ComScore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Foot traffic at the multiplex, which has been relatively stagnant for years, disappointed over the weekend. Dergarabedian said the slate of movies so far this summer, aside from Walt Disney Co.'s  "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," have been poor. Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales" topped the holiday box office but received little help from critics, pulling in $77.0 million, according to ComScore estimates. The box office's other new comer, "Baywatch," distributed by Viacom Inc.'s  Paramount Pictures pulled in just $23.0 million. So far in the summer season, the box office is down 5.6% compared with the same time frame last year. "The pressure is on right now," Dergarabedian said, as the industry looks to June releases "Wonder Woman" from Time Warner Inc.'s  Warner Bros., Disney's "Cars 3" and "Despicable Me 3" from Comcast Corp.-owned  Universal Pictures. The S&P 500 index  was flat during Tuesday trade.

Investors are overreacting to poor returns at the Hollywood box office

Jul. 20, 2017 at 9:23 a.m. ET
by Trey Williams









IMAX shares fall more than 5% leading film exhibitors down in disappointing summer movie season
Film exhibitors continue to experience stock declines as the summer movie season has gotten off to a rough start. Shares of Imax Corp.  were down more than 5%, leading the exhibitor space downward, with AMC Entertainment Holding Inc.  shares falling nearly 4% and shares of Cinemark Holdings Inc. and Marcus Corp.  falling slightly. Regal Entertainment Group shares were up less than 1%. The declines follow a Tuesday selloff that came after the 4-day Memorial Day holiday weekend had the lowest gross in 18 years. "Although Imax has the benefit of global exposure and more local content than the pure play exhibitors, their business is still focused on major blockbuster films and, with a number of those underperforming as of late, we would not be surprised if incremental concerns over near-term results and negative leverage on the model on weaker box office results is causing the selling pressure," B. Riley analyst Eric Wold said. The summer box office, so far through the season, is down 4.7% compared with last year's gross during the same time frame. Shares of the S&P 500 index  were down slightly in intraday trade on Wednesday.

Movie theater stocks suffer after a disappointing Memorial Day weekend at the box office
Shares of movie exhibitors and theater chain operators were down Tuesday after the box office suffered its lowest 4-day Memorial Day weekend draw in 18 years. AMC Entertainment Corp.  led the decline, falling nearly 5%, while IMAX Corp.  fell 4%, Cinemark Holdings Inc.  fell more than 2% and Marcus Corp.  fell 2%. Regal Entertainment Group's  was less severe, falling less than 1%. The box office brought in an estimated $179.0 million over the 4-day weekend, which is the lowest gross for the typically busy weekend since 1999, said ComScore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Foot traffic at the multiplex, which has been relatively stagnant for years, disappointed over the weekend. Dergarabedian said the slate of movies so far this summer, aside from Walt Disney Co.'s  "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," have been poor. Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales" topped the holiday box office but received little help from critics, pulling in $77.0 million, according to ComScore estimates. The box office's other new comer, "Baywatch," distributed by Viacom Inc.'s  Paramount Pictures pulled in just $23.0 million. So far in the summer season, the box office is down 5.6% compared with the same time frame last year. "The pressure is on right now," Dergarabedian said, as the industry looks to June releases "Wonder Woman" from Time Warner Inc.'s  Warner Bros., Disney's "Cars 3" and "Despicable Me 3" from Comcast Corp.-owned  Universal Pictures. The S&P 500 index  was flat during Tuesday trade.

Hospitality Management Services
Marcus Hotels & Resorts is the first choice in the industry, illustrated by our strong performance in our markets. No company knows how to create experiences like we do, tailoring to what guests want in today’s experience economy and, thus, capturing their loyalty. Entertainment and hospitality is in our blood. We make ordinary days extraordinary. With Marcus as an operating partner, we make properties the healthiest and most vibrant they can be, from the guests’ experience and associates’ ambassadorship, to optimizing the value of a portfolio.





We achieve this for our partners through management expertise that includes:


Sales & Revenue Management


Marcus Hotels & Resorts establishes revenue segment goals and strategies in concert with the overall goals of each property. With the ability to monitor productivity centrally, across both branded and independent CRM systems, we quickly identify opportunities to improve overall hotel performance. Training and coaching, from initial engagement to advanced sales negotiation, is provided at onboarding and on an ongoing basis.
Through Marcus’ Customer Care Center – 24-hour reservations and guest support center – advanced technology allow for calls to be routed to specially trained agents that provide service that appears to be on-site, yet at a significantly lower cost. Agents focus on individual properties’ priority revenue goals, and guest feedback and “shop” scores consistently surpass industry benchmarks.
With strategic and tactical expertise at corporate, regional, cluster, and property levels, Marcus’ revenue management allows us to drive market share with a focus on pricing, inventory controls, segmentation analysis, distribution, forecasting, and demand generation through both brand systems and independent approaches.




Marketing & Online Engagement


Marcus Hotels & Resorts has a comprehensive and integrated approach to sales and marketing that focuses on reaching the right person with the right message at the right time and price to optimize capture rates and ROI. We utilize modern technologies and forward-thinking approaches that center around strategic online engagement, customer relationship marketing (CRM), and leverage brand and strategic partnerships.




Financials & Accounting


Marcus provides centralized accounting and finance support, reducing personnel costs at the property level. We utilize industry-leading software packages providing efficiencies and timely insight into financial performance and a full spectrum of tactical areas of oversight.
We offer strategic planning collaboration, aligning budget and goals for optimal performance, as well as comprehensive business and budget planning, and reporting capabilities using our operational and reporting system, and deliver weekly, monthly and annual reporting and measurement that is fully customizable and interfaces seamlessly to PMS, POS, Sales and CRM systems.




Information Technologies


Our hospitality-specific expertise encompasses the entire technology spectrum, and we cover every detail. Marcus Technologies handles all brand standards, system and network security management, 24/7 technology support services, contract negotiation and vendor management, project management, and new construction and renovation technology implementation
Through Graydient, an award-winning part of the Marcus Corporation, we offer a full spectrum of web and application design and development, branding and print design, content strategy and writing, social media management, SEO, e-commerce, email marketing, mobile apps, and augmented reality.




Food & Beverage


Marcus’ F&B businesses focus on outlet performance through compelling and branded F&B concepts driving higher RevPOR than industry benchmarks, memorable events and catering, Marcus Restaurants' loyalty program, and dedicated teams that focus on their specialties resulting in exceptional guest satisfaction.
We drive food and beverage profitability through leveraged product contracts, professional supply chain and procurement solutions, and consolidated spending through flexible national contracts that allow for balancing with local sourcing, as selected.




Fitness, Spa, & Sport


Driven by our focus on overall guest experience, we are experts in operating appropriately positioned, high quality, and profitable operations for guest recreation and enjoyment.
Within our hotel and resort properties, we operate four spas, three of which are our own Well Spa brand with up to $4 million in individual annual revenue and 25% department profitability; fitness centers outfitted for guest needs; two golf courses, ski lifts and an airstrip.




Human Resources


Marcus Hotels & Resorts is built upon the philosophy of “People Pleasing People.” Our associates are one of our most important assets, consistently providing exceptional service and creating extraordinary experiences for our guests.
We provide subject matter expertise in all areas of HR focused on talent attraction, associate training and development, retention, and HR compliance. As a result, our associates’ tenure outpaces that of the industry with stellar response in associate satisfaction.

Hotel Development & Investment Services
 Marcus Hotels & Resorts’ portfolio today reflects more than 50 years of strategic acquisition, partnership, market and product positioning and operational expertise. Our owned and managed assets are  a testament to our success in sourcing the right opportunities, in the right markets, and with the right partners. We keep our finger on the pulse of the industry through our extensive networks to identify and turn around underperforming assets and ill-positioned properties that can benefit from our expertise in market repositioning, rebranding, food and beverage concepts and execution, targeted sales strategies, revenue management, and expense management. Sustainable consumer and asset value are the result.  
Our expertise in operations and project management of full and select service properties, resorts and urban hotels,  and both branded and independent hotels gives us a broad and deep base of knowledge to draw upon in evaluating and executing on a variety of opportunities. Our team is experienced in brand agreement negotiations and we are an approved operator of all major hotel brands.
Through our investment partner, MCS Capital, Marcus Hotels & Resorts has the ability to be an equity investor and provide acquisition support to our partners.











Financial Underwriting

Working with  our operations team, our acquisitions and development team uses realistic financial forecasting, sound investment assumptions, detailed due diligence, current and future demand trends and unique market considerations to prepare detailed operating pro formas and investment theses for  each prospective development, acquisition, and management opportunity. 












Ground Up Development

Marcus has a long history of working with our partners from the very start of a new-build opportunity to ensure that we put together a deal with the best possible results for all parties involved. Whether our partners are looking to develop a new city convention center hotel or an urban, branded select service hotel, or a destination-oriented independent boutique property, our team has the skills and resources to ensure on-time and on-budget execution of an exceptional finished product that delivers the best guest experience and the most profitable outcome for our partners. We guide the development process from entitlements and permitting through the critical stages of pre-opening.














Investments & Acquisitions

Marcus Hotels & Resorts’ affiliate, MCS Capital, is able and willing to invest in lodging assets with our partners. Generally such investments are in the range of 5-20% of the required equity on a pari passu basis. We find that by investing equity in the properties we manage the majority investor takes comfort that our respective interests are aligned and that feasibility of the opportunity has been keenly underwritten from an overall equity return perspective.

Marcus acquired and began managing its first hotel in 1962. Since then the company has bought and developed hotels for its own account and in more recent times has focused on investment relationships with third parties such as private equity funds, REITs, institutional investors, and individual owners to strategically grow the Marcus Hotels & Resorts portfolio in a way that best benefits our partners and ourselves.
