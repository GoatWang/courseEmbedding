February  3, 2009


FHI Unveils the New Robin EH72 FI with Electronic Fuel Injection System,
    General Purpose Engine for the Next Generation,
    While Introducing the New Generations of Robin EH / V-Twin Engine series
Tokyo, February 3, 2009 -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (FHI), the maker of Subaru automobile, today announced the unveiling of its newly developed EH72 FI equipped with the electronic fuel injection system at the World of Concrete Show, which is held from today at Las Vegas in USA. The new EH72 FI will be on production and sale around the world after this spring, as the top-of-the-range model of the general-purpose overhead valve (OHV) engine, "Robin EH / V-Twin series". The series has been received well as a power source for small construction machinery or power generators, compressors and riding mowers.
The EH Series has sold approximately 2.1 million units worldwide since it hit the market in January 1985, being positioned as the top-grade series of Robin general-purpose engines. With fourteen models ranging in displacement from 25 cc to 720 cc, the series boasts outstanding durability and environmental performance, such as exceptional fuel economy and clean exhaust emissions, which are known as advantages of 4-cycle engine.
 The new EH72 FI has been developed as a high performance model. By adopting the newly developed
electronic fuel injection system, the new EH72 FI offers easy and surefire start-up performance as well
as excellent running performance which are less subject to external circumstances, such as changes of
ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, while achieving higher power output by increasing inlet
air volume. Furthermore, by optimizing the fuel injection management, it has improved both the fuel
efficiency as well as low-emission capability, while realizing an agile response when
accelerating/decelerating.
Moreover, by adopting the Engine Control Unit (EUC) incorporated inside the throttle body of electronic fuel injection system, the new EH72 FI has achieved very compact design, which is same envelop size as carbureted engine, to keep superb mountability for machineries.

EH72 FI
At the same time, FHI announced the debut of EH72-2 as the new generation of EH72, while adding special vehicle installation engines, which enables installing to various vehicles, such as golf cart, utility vehicles, and so on, to the EH / V-Twin series including the new EH72 FI.
The EH72-2 has achieved higher power output by adopting 2-Barrel Side draft carburetor system, which increases intake airflow, as well as optimizing camshaft profile and increasing compression ratio.
The vehicle installation engines provide exceptional mountability thanks to the low profile configuration, which eases to place engine underneath driver sheet. Furthermore, by adopting the 2-Barrel Side draft carburetor system as with EH72-2, it has improved the output performance and acceleration response.
FHI operates the general-purpose engine business in its Industrial Products Company. Its enigines have won high-level reliability of users from all over the world. Thanks to its rich lineup, they are used as power source for a wide variety of applications from small construction and agricultural machinery, which builds social infrastructure, to recreational equipment for people’s affluent lives. Starting with the new EH72 FI, the company addresses to expand the adoption of electronic furl injection system to other general-purpose engines for enhancement of its product lineup offering both conveniences and environmental friendliness. With these activities, the company aims to further bolstering its engine business as a global general engine manufacturer who can flexibly and promptly respond to the diverse needs of customers.

Subaru Corporation (株式会社SUBARU, Kabushiki-gaisha Subaru), formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (富士重工業株式会社, Fuji Jūkōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha) (FHI), is a Japanese multinational corporation and conglomerate primarily involved in aerospace and ground transportation manufacturing, known for its line of Subaru automobiles. The company's aerospace division serves as a defense contractor to the Japanese government, manufacturing Boeing and Lockheed Martin helicopters and airplanes under license along with being a global development and manufacturing partner to both companies.

History[edit]
Fuji Heavy Industries traces its roots to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, a leading supplier of airplanes to the Japanese government during World War II. At the end of World War II, Nakajima was broken up by the Allied Occupation government under keiretsu legislation, and by 1950 part of the separated operation was already known as Fuji Heavy Industries.
FHI was incorporated on July 15, 1953 when five Japanese companies, known as Fuji Kogyo, Fuji Jidosha Kogyo, Omiya Fuji Kogyo, Utsunomiya Sharyo and Tokyo Fuji Sangyo, joined to form one of Japan's largest manufacturers of transportation equipment.
By late 1980s, the company was a major supplier of military, aerospace and railroad equipment in Japan, but 80% of its sales came from automobiles. Sales in 1989 fell 15% to US$4.3 billion.[1] In 1990, the company faced a loss of over US$500 million. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., the main bank of the company, asked Nissan Motor which owned 4.2% of the company to step in. Nissan sent Isamu Kawai, the president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., to take charge of FHI.[2] In 1991, FHI started contract-manufacturing Nissan Pulsar (Nissan Sunny in Europe) sedans and hatchbacks.[3]
Currently, the company makes Subaru brand cars, and its aerospace division makes parts for Boeing, helicopters for the Japanese Self Defense Force, Raytheon Hawker, and Eclipse Aviation business jets.
In 2003, the company adopted the logo of its Subaru division as its worldwide corporate symbol.[4]
On October 5, 2005 Toyota Motor Corporation purchased 8.7% of FHI shares from General Motors, which had owned 20.1% since 1999.[5] GM later divested its remaining 11.4% stake on the open market to sever all ties with FHI. FHI previously stated there might have been 27 million shares (3.4%) acquired before the start of trading by an unknown party on October 6, 2005, and speculation suggested a bank or perhaps another automaker was involved. After the purchase, Toyota announced a contract with Subaru on March 13, 2006 to use the underutilized Subaru manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana, USA as well as plans to hire up to 1,000 workers and set aside an assembly line for the Camry, beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In June 2014, the company entered into a contract with Boeing, as one of five major Japanese companies contracted, to build parts for Boeing's 777X aircraft.[6]
In May 2016, Fuji Heavy Industries announced that it would change its name to Subaru Corporation, with the change effective on April 1, 2017.[7][8][9]
Divisions[edit]
Subaru has four main divisions:

The automobile division, Subaru.
The aerospace division is a contractor for the Japan Defense Agency and markets and sells both commercial and defense-related aircraft, helicopters and target drones. For the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force it has built the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell AH-1 Cobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. It will also be responsible for providing maintenance for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.[10][11] This division previously built the FA-200 Aero Subaru and is currently participating in the Airbus A380, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Hawker 4000 and Eclipse 500 programs, and supplies parts for Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 767.
The Subaru Industrial Power Products division manufactures and sells commercial engines, pumps and generators which were formerly under the Subaru-Robin and Robin brands. Subaru's industrial products division, began manufacturing "Star" engines for Polaris Industries snowmobiles in 1968 but engine manufacturing operations ended in 1998 when Polaris Industries started to build their own brand new Liberty two-stroke engines. Subaru remains a Polaris supplier of pistons currently, and remains an invested partner with Polaris. Subaru has provided more than 2 million engines used in Polaris snowmobiles, ATVs, watercraft and utility vehicles.[12]
The eco technology division manufactures and sells garbage trucks, robot sweeper, and wind turbines.
Subaru discontinued the production of buses and railroad cars in 2003.

At the end of World War II, Nakajima was broken up by the Allied Occupation government under keiretsu legislation, and by 1950 part of the separated operation was already known as Fuji Heavy Industries.
FHI was incorporated on July 15, 1953 when five Japanese companies, known as Fuji Kogyo, Fuji Jidosha Kogyo, Omiya Fuji Kogyo, Utsunomiya Sharyo and Tokyo Fuji Sangyo, joined to form one of Japan's largest manufacturers of transportation equipment.
By late 1980s, the company was a major supplier of military, aerospace and railroad equipment in Japan, but 80% of its sales came from automobiles. Sales in 1989 fell 15% to US$4.3 billion.[1] In 1990, the company faced a loss of over US$500 million. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., the main bank of the company, asked Nissan Motor which owned 4.2% of the company to step in. Nissan sent Isamu Kawai, the president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., to take charge of FHI.[2] In 1991, FHI started contract-manufacturing Nissan Pulsar (Nissan Sunny in Europe) sedans and hatchbacks.[3]
Currently, the company makes Subaru brand cars, and its aerospace division makes parts for Boeing, helicopters for the Japanese Self Defense Force, Raytheon Hawker, and Eclipse Aviation business jets.
In 2003, the company adopted the logo of its Subaru division as its worldwide corporate symbol.[4]
On October 5, 2005 Toyota Motor Corporation purchased 8.7% of FHI shares from General Motors, which had owned 20.1% since 1999.[5] GM later divested its remaining 11.4% stake on the open market to sever all ties with FHI. FHI previously stated there might have been 27 million shares (3.4%) acquired before the start of trading by an unknown party on October 6, 2005, and speculation suggested a bank or perhaps another automaker was involved. After the purchase, Toyota announced a contract with Subaru on March 13, 2006 to use the underutilized Subaru manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana, USA as well as plans to hire up to 1,000 workers and set aside an assembly line for the Camry, beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In June 2014, the company entered into a contract with Boeing, as one of five major Japanese companies contracted, to build parts for Boeing's 777X aircraft.[6]
In May 2016, Fuji Heavy Industries announced that it would change its name to Subaru Corporation, with the change effective on April 1, 2017.[7][8][9]
Divisions[edit]
Subaru has four main divisions:

The automobile division, Subaru.
The aerospace division is a contractor for the Japan Defense Agency and markets and sells both commercial and defense-related aircraft, helicopters and target drones. For the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force it has built the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell AH-1 Cobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. It will also be responsible for providing maintenance for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.[10][11] This division previously built the FA-200 Aero Subaru and is currently participating in the Airbus A380, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Hawker 4000 and Eclipse 500 programs, and supplies parts for Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 767.
The Subaru Industrial Power Products division manufactures and sells commercial engines, pumps and generators which were formerly under the Subaru-Robin and Robin brands. Subaru's industrial products division, began manufacturing "Star" engines for Polaris Industries snowmobiles in 1968 but engine manufacturing operations ended in 1998 when Polaris Industries started to build their own brand new Liberty two-stroke engines. Subaru remains a Polaris supplier of pistons currently, and remains an invested partner with Polaris. Subaru has provided more than 2 million engines used in Polaris snowmobiles, ATVs, watercraft and utility vehicles.[12]
The eco technology division manufactures and sells garbage trucks, robot sweeper, and wind turbines.
Subaru discontinued the production of buses and railroad cars in 2003.

Subaru Corporation (株式会社SUBARU, Kabushiki-gaisha Subaru), formerly known as Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (富士重工業株式会社, Fuji Jūkōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha) (FHI), is a Japanese multinational corporation and conglomerate primarily involved in aerospace and ground transportation manufacturing, known for its line of Subaru automobiles. The company's aerospace division serves as a defense contractor to the Japanese government, manufacturing Boeing and Lockheed Martin helicopters and airplanes under license along with being a global development and manufacturing partner to both companies.

History[edit]
Fuji Heavy Industries traces its roots to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, a leading supplier of airplanes to the Japanese government during World War II. At the end of World War II, Nakajima was broken up by the Allied Occupation government under keiretsu legislation, and by 1950 part of the separated operation was already known as Fuji Heavy Industries.
FHI was incorporated on July 15, 1953 when five Japanese companies, known as Fuji Kogyo, Fuji Jidosha Kogyo, Omiya Fuji Kogyo, Utsunomiya Sharyo and Tokyo Fuji Sangyo, joined to form one of Japan's largest manufacturers of transportation equipment.
By late 1980s, the company was a major supplier of military, aerospace and railroad equipment in Japan, but 80% of its sales came from automobiles. Sales in 1989 fell 15% to US$4.3 billion.[1] In 1990, the company faced a loss of over US$500 million. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., the main bank of the company, asked Nissan Motor which owned 4.2% of the company to step in. Nissan sent Isamu Kawai, the president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., to take charge of FHI.[2] In 1991, FHI started contract-manufacturing Nissan Pulsar (Nissan Sunny in Europe) sedans and hatchbacks.[3]
Currently, the company makes Subaru brand cars, and its aerospace division makes parts for Boeing, helicopters for the Japanese Self Defense Force, Raytheon Hawker, and Eclipse Aviation business jets.
In 2003, the company adopted the logo of its Subaru division as its worldwide corporate symbol.[4]
On October 5, 2005 Toyota Motor Corporation purchased 8.7% of FHI shares from General Motors, which had owned 20.1% since 1999.[5] GM later divested its remaining 11.4% stake on the open market to sever all ties with FHI. FHI previously stated there might have been 27 million shares (3.4%) acquired before the start of trading by an unknown party on October 6, 2005, and speculation suggested a bank or perhaps another automaker was involved. After the purchase, Toyota announced a contract with Subaru on March 13, 2006 to use the underutilized Subaru manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana, USA as well as plans to hire up to 1,000 workers and set aside an assembly line for the Camry, beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In June 2014, the company entered into a contract with Boeing, as one of five major Japanese companies contracted, to build parts for Boeing's 777X aircraft.[6]
In May 2016, Fuji Heavy Industries announced that it would change its name to Subaru Corporation, with the change effective on April 1, 2017.[7][8][9]
Divisions[edit]
Subaru has four main divisions:

The automobile division, Subaru.
The aerospace division is a contractor for the Japan Defense Agency and markets and sells both commercial and defense-related aircraft, helicopters and target drones. For the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force it has built the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell AH-1 Cobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. It will also be responsible for providing maintenance for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.[10][11] This division previously built the FA-200 Aero Subaru and is currently participating in the Airbus A380, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Hawker 4000 and Eclipse 500 programs, and supplies parts for Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 767.
The Subaru Industrial Power Products division manufactures and sells commercial engines, pumps and generators which were formerly under the Subaru-Robin and Robin brands. Subaru's industrial products division, began manufacturing "Star" engines for Polaris Industries snowmobiles in 1968 but engine manufacturing operations ended in 1998 when Polaris Industries started to build their own brand new Liberty two-stroke engines. Subaru remains a Polaris supplier of pistons currently, and remains an invested partner with Polaris. Subaru has provided more than 2 million engines used in Polaris snowmobiles, ATVs, watercraft and utility vehicles.[12]
The eco technology division manufactures and sells garbage trucks, robot sweeper, and wind turbines.
Subaru discontinued the production of buses and railroad cars in 2003.

History[edit]
Fuji Heavy Industries traces its roots to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, a leading supplier of airplanes to the Japanese government during World War II. At the end of World War II, Nakajima was broken up by the Allied Occupation government under keiretsu legislation, and by 1950 part of the separated operation was already known as Fuji Heavy Industries.
FHI was incorporated on July 15, 1953 when five Japanese companies, known as Fuji Kogyo, Fuji Jidosha Kogyo, Omiya Fuji Kogyo, Utsunomiya Sharyo and Tokyo Fuji Sangyo, joined to form one of Japan's largest manufacturers of transportation equipment.
By late 1980s, the company was a major supplier of military, aerospace and railroad equipment in Japan, but 80% of its sales came from automobiles. Sales in 1989 fell 15% to US$4.3 billion.[1] In 1990, the company faced a loss of over US$500 million. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., the main bank of the company, asked Nissan Motor which owned 4.2% of the company to step in. Nissan sent Isamu Kawai, the president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., to take charge of FHI.[2] In 1991, FHI started contract-manufacturing Nissan Pulsar (Nissan Sunny in Europe) sedans and hatchbacks.[3]
Currently, the company makes Subaru brand cars, and its aerospace division makes parts for Boeing, helicopters for the Japanese Self Defense Force, Raytheon Hawker, and Eclipse Aviation business jets.
In 2003, the company adopted the logo of its Subaru division as its worldwide corporate symbol.[4]
On October 5, 2005 Toyota Motor Corporation purchased 8.7% of FHI shares from General Motors, which had owned 20.1% since 1999.[5] GM later divested its remaining 11.4% stake on the open market to sever all ties with FHI. FHI previously stated there might have been 27 million shares (3.4%) acquired before the start of trading by an unknown party on October 6, 2005, and speculation suggested a bank or perhaps another automaker was involved. After the purchase, Toyota announced a contract with Subaru on March 13, 2006 to use the underutilized Subaru manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana, USA as well as plans to hire up to 1,000 workers and set aside an assembly line for the Camry, beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In June 2014, the company entered into a contract with Boeing, as one of five major Japanese companies contracted, to build parts for Boeing's 777X aircraft.[6]
In May 2016, Fuji Heavy Industries announced that it would change its name to Subaru Corporation, with the change effective on April 1, 2017.[7][8][9]
Divisions[edit]
Subaru has four main divisions:

The automobile division, Subaru.
The aerospace division is a contractor for the Japan Defense Agency and markets and sells both commercial and defense-related aircraft, helicopters and target drones. For the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force it has built the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell AH-1 Cobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters. It will also be responsible for providing maintenance for the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.[10][11] This division previously built the FA-200 Aero Subaru and is currently participating in the Airbus A380, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Hawker 4000 and Eclipse 500 programs, and supplies parts for Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 767.
The Subaru Industrial Power Products division manufactures and sells commercial engines, pumps and generators which were formerly under the Subaru-Robin and Robin brands. Subaru's industrial products division, began manufacturing "Star" engines for Polaris Industries snowmobiles in 1968 but engine manufacturing operations ended in 1998 when Polaris Industries started to build their own brand new Liberty two-stroke engines. Subaru remains a Polaris supplier of pistons currently, and remains an invested partner with Polaris. Subaru has provided more than 2 million engines used in Polaris snowmobiles, ATVs, watercraft and utility vehicles.[12]
The eco technology division manufactures and sells garbage trucks, robot sweeper, and wind turbines.
Subaru discontinued the production of buses and railroad cars in 2003.
