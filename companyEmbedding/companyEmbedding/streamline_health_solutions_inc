 Improve Coding EfficiencyWhile care delivery is the heart of a provider organization, coding is its financial lifeblood. By translating patient encounters—and all supporting documentation— into billable data, it not only helps ensure you’re appropriately reimbursed; it further documents the quality of care delivered. But coding is fraught with challenges. That’s why its crucial to have experienced support and powerful innovation to help you optimize your coding efforts. Streamline Health provides the ideal balance of experienced service and innovative technology to help confirm compliance and optimize revenue.

 Increase Revenue CertaintyNow more than ever, it’s crucial for providers to know they’re billing correctly for services rendered. Having confidence in your coding processes is key: if you code too aggressively, you expose your organization to audits and potential penalties. If you’re too conservative and undercode, you hinder financial performance and quality ratings. Achieving the best balance in your coding operations requires an experienced approach backed by technology to optimize productivity and results. Streamline Health provides robust solutions and technology-enabled services to help your organization confirm compliance and optimize revenues to fund your mission.

 Decrease Compliance RiskMaintaining revenue compliance has always been challenging, and the resumption of RAC audits will only make it moreso. Coding programs need expert guidance in how to effectively optimize revenue capture without increasing exposure to audits and penalties. Streamline Health provides expert audit services, reinforced by innovative technology, to enable your organization to optimize reimbursements while maintaining revenue integrity.

 Decrease DenialsDenials disrupt your organization on many levels. Every day that a claim goes unpaid, your cash flow is hampered and overall financial performance suffers. Re-works and appeals consume additional time and resources, while days in AR continue to climb. Many variables influence the likelihood of a claim being denied, and Streamline Health delivers the innovative technology and insightful services to help ensure claims are successfully submitted for timely reimbursement.

Increase Documentation AccuracyHaving complete and accurate medical documentation is crucial to supporting good patient health as well as a healthy revenue cycle.  Streamline Health® CDI  provides automated workflows, integrated Physician Queries and robust reporting that enables better productivity to increase documentation quality and optimize revenue capture. Streamline Health CDI services are available for those looking for expert guidance to further optimize documentation quality.

 Improve Coding EfficiencyWhile care delivery is the heart of a provider organization, coding is its financial lifeblood. By translating patient encounters—and all supporting documentation— into billable data, it not only helps ensure you’re appropriately reimbursed; it further documents the quality of care delivered. But coding is fraught with challenges. That’s why its crucial to have experienced support and powerful innovation to help you optimize your coding efforts. Streamline Health provides the ideal balance of experienced service and innovative technology to help confirm compliance and optimize revenue.

 Increase Revenue CertaintyNow more than ever, it’s crucial for providers to know they’re billing correctly for services rendered. Having confidence in your coding processes is key: if you code too aggressively, you expose your organization to audits and potential penalties. If you’re too conservative and undercode, you hinder financial performance and quality ratings. Achieving the best balance in your coding operations requires an experienced approach backed by technology to optimize productivity and results. Streamline Health provides robust solutions and technology-enabled services to help your organization confirm compliance and optimize revenues to fund your mission.

 Decrease Compliance RiskMaintaining revenue compliance has always been challenging, and the resumption of RAC audits will only make it moreso. Coding programs need expert guidance in how to effectively optimize revenue capture without increasing exposure to audits and penalties. Streamline Health provides expert audit services, reinforced by innovative technology, to enable your organization to optimize reimbursements while maintaining revenue integrity.

 Decrease DenialsDenials disrupt your organization on many levels. Every day that a claim goes unpaid, your cash flow is hampered and overall financial performance suffers. Re-works and appeals consume additional time and resources, while days in AR continue to climb. Many variables influence the likelihood of a claim being denied, and Streamline Health delivers the innovative technology and insightful services to help ensure claims are successfully submitted for timely reimbursement.
