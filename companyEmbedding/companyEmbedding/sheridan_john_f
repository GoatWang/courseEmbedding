SHERIDAN PRODUCTS, INC.
Previous trademark marketed by Crosman Corp. located in Bloomfield, NY.
In 1994 through 1995, after their purchase by Crosman Air Guns, some of the separate lines of the Benjamin and Sheridan airgun companies were merged into one.The Sheridan Company of Racine, WI was started in 1945 by E.H. Wackerhagen, who teamed up with fellow airgun enthusiast Robert Kraus, who had engineering skills. He stated that their objective was to best the Benjamin Air Rifle Company by producing what they planned would be the best possible pneumatic air rifle. Mr. Kraus related to Robert Beeman that they felt that because Wackerhagen and Kraus would not be too catchy a name for an air rifle, they named the company after Sheridan Street, a road in Racine which they traversed almost daily as they went between their respective garages during the development of the new gun. Their first model, the Model A, was produced in March 1947. The first paid advertisements evidently appeared about 1948. The perfection of the Model A required a retail price of $56.50 in 1948. Sales were very poor. A less expensive model, the Model B, introduced in October 1948 at a retail price of $42.50, was even less successful. Good sales did not begin until after the introduction of the Model C, which sold for $23.95 in 1949.See the introduction to the Benjamin section for information on manufacturing locations and the names under which these guns have been marketed in the 1990s.All Sheridan air rifles and pistols are single shot, bolt action, breech-loading, and .20 (5mm) caliber. Muzzle velocity figures are for Sheridan´s standard weight pellets of 14.3 grains.For more information and current pricing on the Sheridan firearms, please refer to the Blue Book of Gun Values by S.P. Fjestad (also available online).

Page ContentJohn F. Sheridan, PhDProfessor College of DentistryPhone number: (614) 688-4629Email: john.sheridan@osumc.edu Efficient cutaneous wound healing quickly restores the protective barrier to injured tissue and reduces the risk of infection.  Psychological stress is known to modulate inflammatory responses (Avitsur et al, 2007) and slow the healing of experimental cutaneous and mucosal wounds in humans (Kiecolt-Glaser, et al. 1998, Marucha et al., 1998). It has been shown that slowed healing is associated with activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic nervous system (Padgett et al., 1998), which in turn is associated with diminished mononuclear cell trafficking (Padgett et al., 1998) and reduced expression of cytokine, chemokine and growth factor genes in wound tissue (Mercado et al., 2002).  In addition, stress reduces oxygen content in wound tissue (Gajendrareddy et al, 2005) and increases the susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infections (Rojas et al., 2003).  Additional data generated thus far, have shown that stress alters inflammatory gene expression, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, wound contraction and re-epithelialization. Thus, significant components of wound healing are negatively affected by stress-induced activation of neuroendocrine pathways and altered wound oxygen content. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism by which psychological stress has a significant effect on chemokine, pro-inflammatory cytokine and growth factor gene expression during wound healing.

			Wound, Burn, and Trauma

Page Content
In the United States, skin wounds affect 6.5 million patients placing a major burden, estimated at US$25 billion annually, on society. The research program at OSU utilizes novel state of the art molecular technologies to understand mechanisms that impair healing of chronic wounds. Understanding the mechanisms of action of specific therapeutic intervention is another active area of investigation. A strong multidisciplinary team consisting of clinicians, molecular biologists, imaging specialists, biomedical engineers, statisticians and system biologists support the research program. There is a continuum from bench to bedside and back.  The studies are performed in cell culture, rodent, preclinical and clinical systems.i) diabetic wound healingii) miRNA therapeutics, wound inflammation and angiogenesis, iii) redox and oxygen biology, iv) non-invasive wound imaging, v) biofilm, infection and therapeutics,vi) wound genomics (microarray), proteomics and laser capture microdissection (LCM).
