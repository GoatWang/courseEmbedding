                    At nearly a mile in length, Big River Crossing is the longest public pedestrian bridge across the Mississippi River. 

Big River Crossing is also the country¿s longest active rail/bicycle/pedestrian bridge. It serves as the connection point of Main Street to Main Street, a 10-mile multi-modal corridor that also features the Delta Regional River Park and Big River Trail, creating ties to attractions between Memphis, TN and West Memphis, AR. 

No matter how you travel it, Big River Crossing provides opportunities for recreation and fitness with a whole new point of view.

                    I am a native Memphian, and I love Memphis because there are so many great things to say about the River City that I really don't know where to start; from the Mississippi River, the Pyramid, Elvis Presley, Beale Street, Orpheum Theatre (Broadway plays and musicals), Overton Park with the Memphis Zoo, one of the top zoo's in the nation, Pink Palace Museum, Children's Museum, Levitt Shell (free outdoor concerts), Brooks Art Gallery, the medical center including St. Jude, Le Bonheur and a Level 1 Trauma Center, Amtrak to New Orleans and Chicago, fabulous restaurants and the Green Line to Shelby Farms, the largest urban park in the United States.  Because I'm a native Memphian I have extensive knowledge and a wealth of information on neighborhoods, parks, communities, schools (public and private), restaurants, shopping, etc.  Please send me an email or text requesting information on whatever would interest you about Memphis, and I will reply back quickly.
