EnviroStar, Inc. Announces the Acquisition of Western State Design, Inc. | Business Wire


























































EnviroStar, Inc. Announces the Acquisition of Western State Design, 
      Inc.






September 08, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EnviroStar, Inc. (“EVI”) (NYSE MKT: EVI) today announced that it has 
      executed a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially 
      all of the assets of Western State Design LLC (“Western State Design”), 
      one of the nation’s largest distributors of commercial, industrial, and 
      coin-operated laundry products and a provider of installation and 
      routine maintenance services. Closing of the transaction is subject to 
      certain closing conditions, including a financing condition, and the 
      closing of the private placement described below. The parties intend to 
      close the transaction promptly after all the closing conditions are 
      satisfied, which is expected to occur within the next 30 to 45 days. The 
      transaction is expected to be accretive to EVI’s earnings in its current 
      fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.
    

      Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the purchase price is $28.0 
      million, of which $18.0 million will be paid in cash at the closing and 
      $10.0 million will be paid in shares of EVI’s common stock. The cash 
      portion of the purchase price will be funded in part by the private sale 
      of 1,290,323 shares of EVI’s common stock to Symmetric Capital II LLC, a 
      company controlled by EVI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at 
      $4.65 per share, which was the closing price of EVI’s common stock on 
      the NYSE MKT on September 6, 2016. The balance of the cash portion of 
      the purchase price is expected to be funded by a credit facility that 
      EVI intends to enter into with a commercial bank prior to the closing. 
      The total number of shares of common stock to be issued to Western State 
      Design will be 2,044,990. The maximum number of shares of EVI’s common 
      stock to be issued at the closing of the asset purchase agreement will 
      not exceed 19.9% of the total number of shares of EVI’s common stock 
      outstanding at the time of closing. The Company will obtain stockholder 
      approval prior to the issuance of the shares in excess of such amount 
      prior to their issuance.
    

      Founded in 1974 and based in Hayward, California, Western State Design 
      distributes a comprehensive line of commercial and industrial laundry 
      equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and to the 
      replacement laundry market. Western State Design distributes certain 
      commercial laundry brands on an exclusive basis within the states of 
      California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and parts of Nevada, Arizona and 
      Idaho. Western State Design serves over 6,000 customers in the 
      healthcare, hospitality, cruise line, correctional, government, and 
      commercial and coin-operated laundry industries. Under the joint 
      direction of Dennis Mack and Tom Marks, Western State Design has 
      increased its revenues, profitability, and market share, resulting in 
      recognition as one of the leading distributors and service providers in 
      the industry. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Western 
      State Design generated approximately $60.2 million in revenue.
    

      Consistent with EVI’s buy and build strategy and its operating 
      philosophy, Western State Design will operate as a wholly owned 
      subsidiary of EVI under its current name, from its present locations, 
      led by its existing management team and employees, and with the added 
      benefit of EVI’s support and resources to assist Western State Design in 
      the execution of its growth plans. Additionally, following the closing, 
      Dennis Mack will be named a director and executive officer of EVI and 
      Tom Marks will become an executive officer of EVI.
    

      Dennis Mack, President of Western State Design, and Tom Marks, Executive 
      Vice President of Western State Design, jointly said: “On behalf of the 
      entire team at Western State Design, we are very pleased to be joining 
      the EVI family of commercial laundry businesses. EVI’s goal of becoming 
      the industry’s largest and most versatile commercial laundry products 
      distributor and service provider is promising, and we are aligned with 
      EVI’s business plans and long-term growth strategy. We are also excited 
      about the new opportunities our employees will have to continue their 
      mission of providing superior products, exceptional service, and 
      competitive pricing to our valued customers for many years into the 
      future.”
    

      Henry M. Nahmad, EVI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: 
      “We are thrilled to welcome Dennis Mack, Tom Marks, and all of the 
      employees of Western State Design to the EVI family. We recognize that 
      Western State Design’s success is based on a thriving entrepreneurial 
      culture, strong customer relationships, dedicated employees, and a 
      commitment to exceptional service. For those reasons and others, we 
      believe that the addition of Western State Design to the EVI family will 
      benefit EVI and its customers, employees, and stockholders.”
    

      This press release contains only a brief description of the proposed 
      transactions. EVI will file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) describing in more detail 
      the terms of the acquisition and the private placement.
    

Additional Information and Where to Find it


In connection with the issuance of the shares of EVI’s common stock 
      under the asset purchase agreement which requires stockholder approval, 
      EVI intends to either (i) file a proxy statement in accordance with 
      Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 
      (the “Exchange Act”), or (ii) file an information statement in 
      accordance with Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act, and in each case, 
      other relevant materials with the SEC. The definitive proxy 
      statement or definitive information statement, as the case may be, will 
      also be mailed to EVI’s stockholders, who are urged to read the 
      definitive proxy statement or definitive information statement, as the 
      case may be, and all other relevant documents filed with the SEC, when 
      they become available, because they will contain important information. 
      EVI’s stockholders will be able to obtain these documents (when 
      available) free of charge at the SEC’s web site, http://www.sec.gov. 
      In addition, they may obtain free copies of these documents by 
      contacting EVI’s Secretary at 290 N.E. 68th 
      Street, Miami, Florida 33138, telephone: (305) 754-4551.


If EVI solicits proxies from its stockholders in connection with the 
      issuance of shares of EVI’s common stock under the asset purchase 
      agreement which requires stockholder approval, EVI and certain of its 
      directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in 
      such solicitation. A list of the names and other information regarding 
      the directors and executive officers of EVI is available in EVI’s 
      Definitive Proxy Statement for its 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
      filed with the SEC on October 14, 2015, which can be obtained free of 
      charge from the sources indicated above. Additional information 
      regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included 
      in any definitive proxy statement relating to the stock issuances that 
      require stockholder approval when it becomes available.


Forward Looking Statements


      Except for the historical matters contained herein, statements in this 
      press release are forward-looking and are made pursuant to the safe 
      harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
      1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and 
      unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, trends, 
      performance or achievements of EnviroStar, or industry trends and 
      results, to differ from the future results, trends, performance or 
      achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
      These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those relating to 
      the proposed acquisition and private placement described in this press 
      release, including that the potential benefits of the proposed 
      acquisition may not be realized to the extent anticipated or at all, 
      integration risks, risks related to the business, operations and 
      prospects of Western State Design, and the risk that the conditions, 
      including financing condition, to closing the proposed private placement 
      and acquisition may not be satisfied and that the proposed private 
      placement and acquisition may not otherwise be consummated when 
      expected, in accordance with the contemplated terms, or at all, and the 
      risks related to EnviroStar’s operations, results, financial condition 
      and growth strategy. Reference is also made to other economic, 
      competitive, governmental, technological and other risks and factors 
      discussed in EnviroStar’s filings with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, including, without limitation, its Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015 filed with the SEC on September 
      23, 2015. Many of these risks and factors are beyond EnviroStar’s 
      control. In addition, past performance and perceived trends may not be 
      indicative of future results. EnviroStar cautions that the foregoing 
      factors are not exclusive. Any forward-looking statements relating to 
      the proposed acquisition discussed above are based on EVI’s current 
      expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections and involve 
      significant risks and uncertainties, including the many variables that 
      may impact or are related to consummation of the transaction. EVI 
      assumes no obligation for updating any such forward-looking statements 
      to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other 
      factors affecting such forward-looking statements.

Dexter's technological advancements in coin-op laundry equipment have led to the development of the Dexter Express line of washers and dryers which use less gas and electricity to dry clothes faster. With Dexter Express washers and dryers, coin-op laundry customers can complete a full turn (wash and dry cycle) in under an hour, while utility costs are reduced by 60 percent or more for laundry store owners.

Since 1894, Dexter coin-op laundry machines have been engineered and built in the heartland of America and are now constructed using high-quality, commercial-grade components, including stainless steel encasing options for many models.

The new C-Series is Dexter's most powerful, smartest lineup to date. Leading-edge technology has arrived with innovative DexterLive controls maximizing efficiency and revenue. Alongside DexterLive controls, comes free access to DexterLive.com, a web app that allows unprecedented ease of access for administering machine settings, managing pricing and promotions, and facilitating interactions of multiple users across your business. Available on your tablet, smartphone, computer, or any internet ready device - DexterLive is your smart new business partner.

Coin Op Laundry
The coin-op laundry industry has developed into a reliable source of income for many investors and entrepreneurs. Servicing a primary customer base of 104 million people living in rental housing as of the 2014 updated census information, the average coin-op laundromat can generate cash flow between $15,000 and $200,000 per year with a market value between $50,000 and $1 million. Thanks to a steady market that remains productive, or actually improves during recession (due to an increase in the rental market), coin-op laundromats often occupy their retail space on long-term leases of 10-25 years.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

Western State Design (WSD) of Hayward, California protests the award of a contract to G. A. Braun, Inc. (Braun), of North Syracuse, New York under request for proposals (RFP) No. VA528-11-RP-0105, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish and install commercial laundry equipment at the VA Medical Center in Buffalo, New York. WSD generally challenges the agency's evaluation of its proposal and the selection of a higher-priced proposal for award.
We deny the protest. 











B-404921, Western State Design, June 27, 2011     Decision   Matter of: Western State Design  File: B-404921  Date: June 27, 2011   Dennis Mack for the protester. David W. Altieri, Esq., Department of Veterans Affairs, for the agency. Paula A. Williams, Esq., and Edward Goldstein, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.  DIGEST  Protest challenging agency's award decision and evaluation of firm's own proposal is denied where the record reflects that the selection decision and evaluation were consistent with the terms of the underlying solicitation.  DECISION   Western State Design (WSD) of Hayward, California protests the award of a contract to G. A. Braun, Inc. (Braun), of North Syracuse, New York under request for proposals (RFP) No. VA528-11-RP-0105, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish and install commercial laundry equipment at the VA Medical Center in Buffalo, New York. WSD generally challenges the agency's evaluation of its proposal and the selection of a higher-priced proposal for award.[1]  We deny the protest.  On February 3, 2011, the agency issued the subject solicitation contemplating the award of a fixed-price contract to deliver and install laundry equipment described as a "medium production folder cross folder with large piece stacker machine" within 14 days of contract award. Id. at 38, 47. Among other requirements, the offered equipment had to be compatible with the existing laundry equipment, had to be suitable for installation in the available space, and had to include lock-out and tag-out devices. Id. at 38.[2] Award was to be made to the offeror whose proposal was determined to be most advantageous to the government, considering four evaluation factors: (1) technical capability; (2) price; (3) quality/past performance; and (4) work plan. Id. at 46. The solicitation advised that "the individual factors are considered to be of equal importance; therefore the non-price factors of technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price." Id. at 46-47.  The VA received timely proposals from WSD and Braun. Proposals were evaluated under the technical capability factor using the following adjectival rating system (which was not disclosed in the solicitation): outstanding; excellent; acceptable; marginal; and unacceptable.[3] Agency Report (AR) exh. 6, Evaluation Scoring Sheets. The past performance evaluation contemplated a risk assessment of very low risk, low risk, moderate risk, high risk, or neutral risk. Id. After completing an initial evaluation, the VA held discussions with each offeror. WSD and Braun submitted revised proposals and the agency completed its evaluation.   In the final consensus evaluation, the agency rated WSD's proposal as marginal overall, with marginal ratings for the technical capability and work plan factors, as well as a very low performance risk rating for the past performance factor. The marginal ratings resulted from WSD's failure to adequately address several solicitation requirements. As it relates to the protest, the agency found that WSD failed to establish how its equipment would be compatible with the existing Braun laundry equipment. AR exh. 6, Evaluation Scoring Sheets, at 1-7; exh. 7, Source Selection Decision, at 4-5.   Braun's proposal was rated satisfactory overall, and, like WSD, received a very low performance risk rating under the past performance factor. With regard to price, WSD's proposal was low, with a total price of $76,250, whereas Braun's price was $79,602.65. AR exh. 7, Source Selection Decision, at 2-3. The agency concluded that Braun's higher-rated, higher-priced proposal constituted the best value and selected Braun for award. Id. at 5. After receiving a debriefing, WSD filed this protest.   WSD argues that the agency's selection decision and evaluation of its proposal were improper. According to WSD, because the solicitation did not specify the weights to be attributed the evaluation factors, "there is no clear acquisition mechanism to [determine]" that Braun's higher'priced proposal offers the best value to the government. Protest at 1; Protester's Comments at 1-2. WSD also challenges the agency's finding that its proposal failed to establish the compatibility of its equipment with the existing Braun equipment.   First, WSD's suggestion that the agency's selection decision was illusory because the RFP failed to establish the weight to be given each factor, is factually erroneous and therefore without merit.[4] As described above, the RFP specifically established that the evaluation factors were equally-weighted, and that the technical capability and past performance factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price for the purpose of making a best value decision. RFP at 46-47.   Second, WSD's challenge of the agency's technical evaluation, is also without merit.  In reviewing a protest against the propriety of an evaluation, it is not our role to independently evaluate proposals and substitute our judgment for that of the contracting activity. Shumaker Trucking & Excavating Contractors, Inc., B-290732, Sept. 25, 2002, 2002 CPD para. 169 at 3. Rather, we will review an evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria in the solicitation and applicable procurement statutes and regulations; a protester's mere disagreement with the evaluation does not show it lacked a reasonable basis. VT Griffin Servs., Inc., B-299869.2, Nov. 10, 2008, 2008 CPD para. 219 at 4.  Here, the underlying record supports the agency's evaluation. In this regard, under the technical capability factor, the solicitation stated that each proposal would be evaluated as to whether the offered equipment was compatible with the existing Braun laundry equipment. RFP at 38. Notwithstanding repeated requests during discussions asking the protester to explain "how [its] equipment is compatible with and will interface with the existing Braun equipment" see, AR exh. 4, WSD's Proposal, at 22 and 24, WSD failed to demonstrate that this was in fact the case, as determined by the agency's evaluators. Id. exh. 6, Evaluation Scoring Sheets. In its comments responding to the agency report on this issue, WSD does not meaningfully rebut the agency's assessments regarding its failure to satisfy this requirement; rather, the protester simply repeats the general assurance it provided to the agency during discussions that its equipment "would be fully compliant." Protester's Comments at 1; see also, AR exh. 4, WSD's Proposal, at 22 (stating in response to an additional discussion question on this issue that its equipment "is compatible with the existing Braun equipment and will function per the specifications set out by the VA").   An offeror is responsible for demonstrating affirmatively the merits of its proposal and risks rejection if it fails to do so. See John Blood, B-402133, Jan. 15, 2010, 2010 CPD para. 30 at 3-4; HDL Research Lab, Inc., B-294959, Dec. 21, 2004, 2005 CPD para. 8 at 5. No matter how competent an offeror may be, the technical evaluation must be based on information included in the firm's quotation. See Watson Indus., Inc., B-238309, Apr. 5, 1990, 90-1 CPD para. 371 at 3-4. Having failed to demonstrate that its equipment met the agency's requirements, the agency properly downgraded WSD's proposal on this basis.   Based on our review of the entire record, we see nothing unreasonable in the agency's evaluation of WSD's proposal as marginal. WSD's complaints constitute mere disagreement with the agency's evaluation and, as such, do not provide a basis for sustaining the protest. In sum, the VA's selection of Braun's higher-priced, higher-rated proposal was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.   The protest is denied.[5]  Lynn H. Gibson General Counsel   [1] The protester is not represented by counsel therefore our discussion of some aspects of the procurement is general in nature in order to avoid disclosure of non-public information. Our conclusions, however, are based on our review of the entire record, including non-public information.   [2] The solicited equipment is part of a large, three component integrated laundry system manufactured and installed by Braun. Contracting Officer Statement at 1.   [3] As relevant here, acceptable was defined as: Proposal demonstrates acceptable understanding of requirements and approach that meets performance or capability solution. Has few or no strengths. AR exh. 7, Source Selection Decision, at 2. Marginal was defined as: Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance. Id. at 3.    [4] The issue is also untimely. A protest based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of proposals, such as the issue raised by WSD, must be filed before the closing time. Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. sect. 21.2(a)(1) (2011); e.g., General Dynamics--Ordnance & Tactical Sys., B'401658, B-401658.2, Oct. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD para. 217 at 6 (dismissing as untimely a post-award challenge to evaluation scheme that could produce a misleading result).    [5] WSD raises other collateral arguments. For example, the protester contends that the VA communicated with Braun regarding early delivery of the solicited equipment (14 days after contract award) before the RFP was actually issued. Protest at 2. WSD has provided nothing in support of these claims and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the agency improperly communicated with Braun.
