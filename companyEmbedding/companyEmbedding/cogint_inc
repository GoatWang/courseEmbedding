We deterministically target consumers across various marketing channels and devices, through the user-supplied acquisition of personally-identifiable information on behalf of our clients, such as email addresses, other identifying information and responses to dynamically-populated survey questions. 80% of our consumer interaction comes from mobile, which differentiates us from competitors whose platforms are not mobile-first.















Why Cogint Is Undervalued - Cogint, Inc. (NASDAQ:COGT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why Cogint Is UndervaluedJan.27.17 | About: Cogint, Inc. (COGT) JGR Capital Partners Long/short equity, valueJGR Capital Partners websiteSummaryAll companies need advertisements, risk management and data analytics. Cogint is quickly expanding into these profitable markets.Cogint’s gross margins are the same or better than its competitors. Once its operations scale because of the implementation of its new segments, its gross margins will increase even more.Has many recurring Fortune 500 client companies on its roster, which proves the value of its offerings.From a valuation perspective, the company looks attractive given its stronger top-line growth relative to its peers.Brief Business Description Cogint (NASDAQ:COGT) is a big data and analytics company that provides solutions to its customers in three main segments: Risk Management, Consumer Marketing, and Custom Analytics. It is a cloud-based company that offers its services to a variety of sectors and industries, with a focus on new data-driven marketing solutions. Cogint also helps companies manage risk and identify fraud within their technology. 

 Company presentation Investment Overview Small capitalization stocks are known for their risk and Cogint is no different. That said, we recommend the company even though it suffered a loss last quarter. One of the reasons it suffered a loss was a one-time write-off of $4M for purchased IP and litigation costs. The reason for this fee was that Cogint's subsidiary company, The Best One, purchased intellectual property from Ole Poulsen on October 14, 2014. Since the company had to defend its claim to the property from TransUnion Risk & Alternative Data Solutions (Source), we do not expect this to be a recurring expense. The company is in a development phase and still discovering its capabilities. In the past, Cogint's gross margins have been substantially higher than its competitors. In the third quarter, gross margins suffered as the company invested in growing its various business segments. The company's gross margins came in at 24%, 3% lower than the last two quarters. Compared to its competitors, such as TransUnion whose gross margin is 21.8% (last quarter), or CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) whose gross margin is 16%, Cogint is still outperforming its competitors. These strengths will likely scale soon. COGS will lower and gross margins will increase substantially as the company begins to benefit from economies of scale. Cogint will outperform its competitors considerably in this area.
 COGT increased its revenue by 27% over the second-quarter 2016, according to its press release, which is a positive indicator of growth. The company is in a great position to increase revenue moving forward by creating new products that showcase its ability to combine different technologies that stem from its access to proprietary data. Another influential reason to purchase shares is the extensive list of the companies that use its services. Fortune 500 companies such as Cheapflights.com, Western Union (NYSE:WU), Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) all use Cogint's services. They have been recurring customers of the business and are not simply one-time trial customers. This recurring revenue stream is unique and great for investors as it provides a greater ability to predict earnings and free cash flow compared to other businesses. 

 Company presentation 

 Company presentation Valuation 

 Source: Author Analysis 


 Source: Author Analysis In order to value Cogint, we screened for comparable information and analytics companies. Using Cogint's projected consensus 2017 revenue of $235 million, and an average comparable company enterprise value to revenue multiple, based on the 50,663,171 shares outstanding, we are setting a 12-month price target of $12. Thus investors purchasing shares at current levels would enjoy substantial upside if our price target is achieved. Competition Observing Cogint's competition, they have a rustic, dated feel about them. TransUnion, founded in 1968, and Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO), founded in 1956, especially seem to not have the relevancy or innovation that Cogint exhibits. Working in the data analytics industry, companies must not fall behind or they will be left behind. These companies are ahead of Cogint regarding their financial stance, but this does not reflect its unique position in the market driven by its technology. Cogint has an important advantage over its competition namely its adaptability and catering to millennials and their unique needs. Additionally, it has an experienced management team which has built and sold companies in this sector. In the last decade, it has become much difficult for companies to market to consumers. People are accessing content in a variety of ways. Unlike its peers, Cogint combats this elusiveness by having 80% of consumer interactions through mobile devices. We view Cogint's mobile strategy as powerful and also necessary as we move to an all-mobile world. 

 Company presentation Insider trading at Cogint is also a positive reflection on the outlook of the company. The largest inside shareholder is Ryan Schulke, the chief executive officer of Fluent, LLC, with 550,000 shares. Overall, key insiders hold a total of 1,207,566, which is 2.4% of total shares and a market value of $4,709,507. For being in the early stages of this company, it is a positive sign to see management so invested in it.
 With Cogint's acquisitions of both Fluent, LLC and Q Interactive, Inc., the opportunity for growth has increased exponentially for the company as well as an increase in shareholder value. Each subsidiary has come with an improvement in leadership and management as well as an expansion of technology, unique to both companies. Fluent LLC will bring its expertise in people-based digital marketing and customer acquisition, which uses mobile devices and survey responses to gain a deeper insight into customers' buying decisions. Q Interactive complements Fluent's digital marketing by providing hundreds of millions of leads to advertisers as well as validating consumer data such as email, home address and phone number. We expect these acquisitions will significantly benefit shareholders through synergistic growth. An example of past big data mergers support this assumption. IHS Markit (NASDAQ:INFO), one of Cogint's competitors, has used this tactic for the last couple of years to increase market share and shareholder value by bolting on smaller competitor companies. When IHS acquired Markit, it received a tax break of around 15% as well as an increase in share price by nearly 12%. Thus, we view acquisitions as a viable strategy for growth in this industry. Another highly publicized big data merger took place when Dell acquired EMC Corp. for $67 billion. This buyout positions Dell for significant growth, as well as helping its transition from being a personal computer provider to a big data company. EMC specializes in information security, data storage, cloud computing, big data analytics and covers around 20% of the data storage market (to put that into perspective, it's double the amount of Dell). Reflects the consideration paid at closing to Fluent's shareholders in IDI's common stock.               Convertible preferred shares issued to Sellers as purchase consideration     300,000     Conversion ratio     50:1     Equivalent common shares     15,000,000     Share price of common stock as of December 8, 2015   $ 8.45                 Purchase Price amount paid in shares   $ 126,750,000     Source Acquisition of Q Interactive 

 Source Acquisition Sources: Fluent Q Interactive Core Risk Factors Cogint operates in highly competitive and lucrative markets with many competitors that are larger. Failure to appeal to companies and gain understanding in how Cogint's products may benefit them may also be reflective in lower-than-expected sales. Finally too much emphasis on a variety of products may lead individual product lines to be underdeveloped and/or not gain sufficient market share. Summary Cogint is a company that is still in its infancy and has financials that do not accurately reflect its potential. This company is entering markets with a lot of opportunity for ingenuity and growth, and has an advantage with its leading-edge technological products and proprietary data. It will likely continue to exhibit strong top-line growth. Cogint differentiates itself from its competitors by being cloud based and targeting consumers 80% through mobile devices. The company has established itself as today's generations data analytics company through its adaptive strategy while older and dated companies are likely to get left behind. Cogint's proven management and large insider ownership give confidence to shareholders that the company is headed in the right direction. Finally, the acquisition of Fluent, LLC and Q Interactive, Inc. increases shareholder value significantly and opens opportunities that would have been unavailable to the company if it stood on its own.

According to IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report published in 2015, in the U.S. alone Internet advertising spending was close to $60 billion. The company's addressable market in the U.S. alone stands at $67 billion. The key driver of this market of course is the adoption of mobile devices. While growth of smartphone and tablets is expected to slowdown in the coming years, shipments are still expected to reach 1.84 billion by 2020, according to IDC. Areas such as Phablets are still expected to have double-digit growth until 2020.
 The other growing market that Cogint is targeting is the Risk Analytics software market. In the U.S. alone, this market was estimated to be more than $8 billion, according to a 2016 report published by MarketsandMarkets. Overall, the Global Business Analytics market is expected to reach $161 billion by 2019, according to IDC. Growth, not surprisingly, will be driven by continuing migration towards cloud. In terms of products, Cogint has four offerings. The products include idiCORE and Data Acquisition Solutions within the Information Services space, and Audience Solutions and Mobile Acquisition Engine within the Performance Marketing Space. 

 Source: Company Presentation Cogint's client base currently includes companies such as Western Union, Cheapflights.com and Finish Line (NASDAQ:FINL). Cogint has a major competitive advantage because of its comprehensive offering. The company is present at each point of the value chain from platform to generating actionable intelligence. None of the companies in the data mining space provide such a comprehensive product offering. One of the biggest strengths of Cogint is its top management. The company is led by Derek Dubner. Dubner worked closely with Hank Asher, who is known as the "father of data mining." Cogint's COO Harry Jordan served in a range of roles at LexisNexis Risk Solutions (a division of Reed Elsevier). Jordan was in charge of LexisNexis Healthcare. He took the business from inception to more than $100 million in annual revenue. Cogint's Executive Chairman, Michael Brauser has been consistently buying shares in the company, which is always a positive sign. Brauser was the founder of Seisant, which was acquired by LexisNexis for $775 million.
 Robust Revenue Growth, Strong Balance Sheet In the third quarter of 2016, Cogint reported consolidated revenue of $52.2 million, up 27% on a sequential basis. In terms of segments, it was the company's Performance Marketing segments that contributed major portion of the revenue ($37.4 million). Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.2 million. Cogint also has a healthy balance sheet. Its cash balance at the end of the September quarter was $10.4 million. In November, the company raised another $6 million through a stock offering. But more important is to focus on Cogint's future growth. And that growth is most likely to come from idiCORE. In fact, once the product becomes a bigger part of the revenue mix, it could boost EBITDA margins, which were one of the disappointments in the third quarter of 2016. Looking ahead, Cogint sees 2017 revenue to come in between $230 million to $235 million. This would represent growth of around 20% from the estimated revenue range for the full year 2016. If this revenue growth can be combined with significant margin expansion then we have a strong investment case. The company's long-term EBITDA margin target is between 20% and 25%. Investment Case: Unlocking the Value The investment case for Cogint is based on the increasing adoption of big data analytics. The company stands out because of its unique product offering. As I noted earlier, it is present at every point of the value chain, which gives it a huge advantage over competitors. Based on the 2017 estimate for revenue, Cogint trades at just under 1x sales. According to Barrington Research, Criteo, a peer in the performance marketing space, trades at a multiple of 2.6x sales. Even if you assign a discount of 30% to Cogint's multiple, we are talking about a multiple of 2x estimated sales. That translates to a valuation of more than double from current roughly $210 million. Even after applying the industry multiples though, there is a significant valuation anomaly. And this is where the COGT story gets even more interesting. Currently, the valuation for COGT is based on just its Fluent product offering. In fact, in the third quarter, Fluent generated 97% of the company's sales and nearly all of its gross profits. The valuation of COGT is essentially based on Fluent at the moment. The consensus price target for COGT currently stands at $6, which translates to a market value of around $310 million. That is roughly 1.5x 2017 sales estimate. Like I noted this is just valuing the Fluent business. The market is not assigning any value for idiCORE. This is understandable as the product is currently not contributing to the financial results. However, the future for COGT will be in idiCORE. As idiCORE operations expand in the next two-three years, valuation is expected to enhance. In fact, the product saw an encouraging launch in mid-2016. In the first month of its launch, the company had 2,800 users for idiCORE, which is an impressive number considering that the product is still evolving.
 The valuation anomaly has also led to significant insider buying activity. Since November alone, insiders have bought a total of 630,000 shares, which translates to around 1% of total outstanding shares. In the last nine months, insiders have bought a total of 3.34 million shares. Back in May 2016, insiders purchased at price as high as $5.25 per share, highlighting the fact that insiders considered COGT undervalued even then. The table below gives the insider buying transactions at Cogint since November alone.   Insider Name Insider Title Shares Purchased Date Purchased Price   Robert N Fried Director 2,000 11/07/2016 $3.75   Jeff Dell Chief Information Officer (NYSE:CIO) 2,000 11/07/2016 $3.20   Robert Swayman Director 10,000 11/07/2016 $3.68   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 20,679 11/07/2016 $3.51   Derek Dubner CEO 3,000 11/07/2016 $3.66   Matthew Conlin President of Fluent LLC 21,812 11/07/2016 $3.51   Daniel Maclachlan CFO 1,000 11/07/2016 $3.45   Michael Brauser Chairman 18,000 11/07/2016 $3.64   Phillip Frost, MD Director (10%) 35,000 11/04/2016 $3.17   Harry Jordan III COO 155,000 11/07/2016 $3.97   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 5,000 11/08/2016 $4.01   Matthew Conlin President of Fluent LLC 5,000 11/08/2016 $4.01   Michael Brauser Chairman 6,500 11/08/2016 $3.79   Matthew Conlin President of Fluent LLC 5,000 11/09/2016 $3.73   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 5,000 11/09/2016 $3.72   Michael Brauser Chairman 5,000 11/09/2016 $3.69   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 2,000 11/29/2016 $3.79   Michael Brauser Chairman 3,500 11/29/2016 $3.71   Michael Brauser Chairman 3,000 11/30/2016 $3.35   Harry Jordan III COO 5,000 11/30/2016 $3.25   Michael Brauser Chairman 3,500 12/09/2016 $3.43   Michael Brauser Chairman 1,500 12/14/2016 $3.29   Robert Swayman Director 50,000 01/20/2017 $3.12   Matthew Conlin President of Fluent LLC 100,000 01/23/2017 $3.15   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 150,000 01/24/2017 $3.15   Ryan Schulke CEO of Fluent LLC 15,000 01/27/2017 $3.95   I believe that at some point COGT should consider spinning off the business to unlock its value. In any case, at current valuation, COGT also looks an interesting M&A target, especially given the growing importance of big data and the fact that the market is valuing a key growth driver in idiCORE at nothing.
 It is also important to note that with Cogint there is no near-term dilution risk. The November offering has strengthened the company's balance sheet. The major risks I foresee for Cogint at the moment are operational. The company needs to improve its EBITDA margin. The idiCORE product becoming a bigger part of mix could help the company in this regard. In fact, in a shareholder letter late last year, CEO Dubner noted that the company reverted to historically higher margins at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Another risk is the lack of liquidity with the COGT stock. However, this could improve with the company's move to the NASDAQ. COGT was previously listed on the NYSE MKT but made a move to NASDAQ in September when it also changed its corporate name. The move to NASDAQ, combined with the growth prospects for big data, should bring in more institutional investors.

Stock market closes lower as geopolitics hamper equity benchmark’s record run

Jun. 5, 2017 at 4:39 p.m. ET
by Barbara Kollmeyer









Cogint's stock pares some losses after company refutes short seller's allegations
Cogint Inc.'s stock  plunged 14% in afternoon trade Monday, but pared some losses after the data intelligence and analytics company's assertion that a short seller's negative research note included numerous "recycled and fabricated inaccuracies and misstatements." Volume had already reached a record of 2.86 million shares more than two hours before the regular session's close. The stock was down as much as 25% at an intraday low of $4.15 earlier. "Today, our company was subjected to an unscrupulous internet blog by an anonymous, admitted short seller of the stock," said Cogint Chief Executive Derek Dubner. "It is unfortunate that small companies must endure this self-serving, unethical and perhaps illegal conduct." The company said it and its management haven't received any communications from the Securities and Exchange Commission or from any federal law enforcement agency, as the short seller claimed. Earlier, short seller Une Mon said documents revealed that several Cogint insiders, including Chairman Michael Brauser, were facing multiple investigations by the SEC and the Department of Justice regarding securities fraud. The stock has run up 39% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

Cogint's stock tumbles on heavy volume after short seller's note
Shares of Cogint Inc.  tumbled 11% in active morning trade Monday, following a negative report from a short seller alleging that a number of the data analysis company's insiders were under investigation for securities fraud. Volume spiked to over 1 million shares within the first hour of the regular session, compared with the full-day average of about 210,000 shares. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Short seller Une Mon said documents reveal that several Cogint insiders, including Chairman Michael Brauser, are facing multiple investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice regarding collapsed stock promotions. The stock has run up 43% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
