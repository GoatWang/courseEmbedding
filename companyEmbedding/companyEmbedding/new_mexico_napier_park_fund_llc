Napier Park Cares
Employees at Napier Park are committed to making a positive impact in our community. Recent community outreach efforts include:



Berklee College of MusicJim O’Brien, Senior Managing Partner of Napier Park Global Capital, and his wife Judy gave a generous gift to the Berklee College of Music to have the dining hall stage named in honor of singer-songwriter Jackson Browne.  The O’Briens were inspired to make the gift in Jackson Browne’s honor in part to recognize him for his volunteer work with students at the Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center in Los Angeles.  Jim and Judy are both longtime supporters of the Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center and Jim currently serves as the Chair of the Board of Directors.  They hope that Berklee students for years to come will find inspiration on a stage named for Browne.
To learn more about the dedication, please visit: https://www.berklee.edu/news/berklee-dedicates-jackson-browne-stage
About Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center
The Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center (FPCAC) is a non-profit organization, which provides quality arts instruction to 600 under-served students, age 8-20 years old, in South Los Angeles. FPCAC teachers provide a program filled with structure and well planned curriculum to help their students build self-esteem, develop civic responsibility and learn to apply the same dedication and commitment to their academic efforts.This is particularly important because Performing Arts assist in children’s development and enriches the lives of the community. Arts, including theatre, are vital to a well-rounded education and person. Yet, many local public schools offer little to no performing arts programs. Arts instruction has been proven to raise test scores, improve reading and communication skills, improve school attendance and reduce High School dropout rates.The donations that Michael was able to raise through his efforts will allow 45 jazz students to gain access to both instruments and practice time. These donations will also help put cameras in the hands of 60 film students. FPCAC has assisted thousands of children in gaining acceptance to college, and four students of the program have gone on to win Grammys.

Cycle for SurvivalOn March 10, 2016, Team Napier Park rode in the New York Cycle for Survival event. 12 Napier Park employees participated in a relay-style cycling event funding rare cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
We raised $64,125 in the event which includes a $25,000 award from the Bloomberg Challenge for raising more between the hours of 6pm - midnight that night than any other team in attendance.
About Cycle for Survival
Cycle for Survival, is a national indoor cycling event that funds rare cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). MSK is one of the world's premier cancer research institutions, and the work conducted there benefits patients around the world. In just the first nine years of Cycle for Survival events, over $75 million has been raised.
That's an incredible number, but we must keep increasing it to beat these diseases!
Funding for rare cancer research is critical. Approximately 50% of people with cancer are fighting a rare cancer. And these are familiar diseases: all pediatric cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, and thyroid, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, among many others. The people fighting rare cancers face limited, if any, treatment options.

ReserveAidEvan Odim, Senior Operation Analyst at Napier Park Global Capital, and five friends ran the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim (“R2R2R”) to raise awareness for ReserveAid. Evan and his team set out on this 50 mile endurance run, with an elevation change of approximately 20,000 feet, on October 31, 2015. The team started on the Canyon’s South Rim (via South Kaibab Trail), then headed to the North Rim, and then turned around and ran back to the South Rim (via the Bright Angel Trail). Evan was able to successfully raise close to $25,000 for this endeavor which will go an incredibly long way toward helping our veterans.
Why would anyone do this to themselves? As Evan said:
“The late Steve Jobs once stated ‘I want to put a ding in the universe.’ While I’m certainly not out here looking to change the world, I am trying to help those who keep me and my family safe. Consider this my effort to ‘ding.’ 
The daily financial hardships faced by our Reservists and National Guard members, simply because they are making good on their commitment to protect our freedoms, dwarf the challenges I will face on the run. To the degree that I can honor their commitment and help in any way I can, I will.”
About ReserveAid
ReserveAid is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization that makes unrestricted, need based grants to military Reservists, and families of Reservists, on full time deployment to a combat zone or homeland security position. ReserveAid exists as a response to the hardships and grim financial realities experienced by the men and women of the United States Armed Forces Reserves.
Nearly one half of American troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are from Reserve units. As a result of lengthy activations, many Reservists are suffering emotionally and financially as they worry about providing for their families back home and completing their missions abroad. ReserveAid’s objective is to meet every valid emergency financial need of service members and their dependents within 48 hours of grant approval.

Grace InstituteAn integral part of the Grace Institute curriculum is to have the women visit an office to begin to imagine and prepare for the next step in their career journey. On July 29, 2015, Napier Park collaborated with Grace Institute and hosted the firm’s 3rd Annual Grace at Work Event. Napier Park hosted seven women from the Grace Institute at the office to give them exposure to a diverse range of jobs, learn about the Napier Park business and goals, network and hear personal success stories from our employees. One of the many highlights of the day was the opportunity to hear from Napier Park Compliance Associate, Maria Kling, who is a Grace graduate herself, and a true testament to the strength of the program and how helpful it has been in her own career.
About Grace Institute
Grace Institute was founded in 1897 by W.R. Grace, twice-elected Mayor of New York City. For 119 years, Grace Institute has provided tuition-free career training and job placement services to over 100,000 economically disadvantaged women throughout New York City. Each year, 300 unemployed women ages 18 and over are trained with the computer and business skills necessary to pursue a fulfilling career and financial independence.

Weill Cornell MedicineJonathan Dorfman and Jim O’Brien, Senior Managing Partners at Napier Park, made a three-part gift to patient care, research and education at Weill Cornell Medicine. The men and their families are longtime patients of Christopher Barley, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine – and so, inspired by the care they’ve received for well over a decade, recently made a joint gift that will touch on each area of the mission at Weill Cornell Medicine.
Empowering Future Physicians
Christopher Barley, M.D. Scholarship – Judy and Jim O’Brien and Melissa Kaish and Jonathan Dorfman have established an endowed scholarship for medical college students pursuing general medicine. Scholarships like these help relieve financial strain for students graduating with large amounts of debt and provide freedom to pursue general and primary care medicine if that is their passion.
Promoting Discovery and Innovation
Daedalus Fund for Innovation – Mr. Dorfman and Mr. O’Brien supported this program providing funding for promising medical research with commercial potential.
Training for Excellence in Physicianship
Mr. Dorfman and Mr. O’Brien supported crucial clinical fellowships in infectious diseases. Fellows graduate as leaders in clinical care focused on treating individuals with infectious diseases including HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis, malaria and tuberculosis.
For additional information, please see the October 2015 edition of Weill Cornell Medicine “Milestones”.
