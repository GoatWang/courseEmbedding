John Jacob Desmond (April 5, 1922 – March 27, 2008) was an American architect in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who designed such public buildings as the Baton Rouge River Center, the Louisiana State University Student Union, Bluebonnet Swamp Interpretive Center, Louisiana Arts and Sciences Center, Louisiana State Archives, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State Library, and the Louisiana Naval Museum. He also designed the United States Embassy building in Monrovia, Liberia, the Lindy Boggs Center (named for former U.S. Representative Corrine "Lindy" Boggs) at his own alma mater, Tulane University in New Orleans, and the cafeteria at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, the principal city of Tangipahoa Parish.[1]
Desmond and his firm, Desmond, Miremont & Burks, later John Desmond and Associates,[2] also designed numerous churches, including Grace Memorial Episcopal Church in Hammond and St. Joseph's Cathedral, Westminster Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge,[3] Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church (his own congregation), and the Catholic Life Center, all in Baton Rouge.[4]

Early years, education, military[edit]
Desmond was born in Denver, Colorado, to Timothy J. Desmond and the former Rose Isabelle Dvorak (1886–1982),[5] but he lived most of his life in Hammond and Baton Rouge. He graduated from Hammond High School in 1937 and thereafter procured his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Tulane. He obtained a Master of Architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where he studied under the American Institute of Architects gold medal winners William Wurster and Alvar Aalto, a native of Finland.[6]
During World War II, Desmond served in the United States Navy as an ensign aboard the destroyer USS Madison (DD-425), which escorted convoys across the Atlantic. He saw action in the Battle of Anzio, Italy, in the Mediterranean. After the war, upon finishing his education, he worked for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York City, architect A. Hays Town in Baton Rouge, and for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1953, he returned to Hammond to open the first architectural practice in the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana. He was the Tangipahoa Parish School Board architect for some twenty years.[6]
Excellence in architecture[edit]
Allen Eskew, a New Orleans architect who was influenced by Desmond's style, told the reporter Jeremy Harper of the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate that Desmond was "really one of the giants of midcentury modern Louisiana architecture."[4] He could incorporate early Acadian design elements into modern structures. His pen-and-ink drawings have been exhibited across the nation and published internationally. He received a "Lifetime Achievement Award from the Louisiana chapter of the AIA. Desmond's firm held offices in Hammond and Baton Rouge until the 1970s, when he worked exclusively out of Baton Rouge. He also taught architecture at Tulane, LSU, and historically black Southern University in Baton Rouge. His drawings and photographs have been featured in numerous national and international magazines and have been exhibited in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and New York City.[7] His work is featured in his book, Louisiana’s Antebellum Architecture, published in 1970 by Claitor's in Baton Rouge.[8]
In 1986, the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awarded Desmond its most prestigious honor, the Preservation Award, which he received for focusing upon awareness of the past through his work as a preservationist and for his historically-influenced modern designs. Desmond was described as both "talented and generous-spirited." Eskew, one of the designers of the award-winning Louisiana State Museum in Baton Rouge, noted how Desmond was able to weave a "large building masterfully in a canopy of existing mature oaks" in the establishment of the LSU Student Union.[4]
Desmond was a fellow in the A.I.A. for "Significant Contribution to Design".[9] He was "Outstanding Alumnus" of the Tulane School of Architecture. He was cited for "Excellence in the Arts" by the Arts Council of the Mayor-President, combined Baton Rouge municipal and East Baton Rouge Parish office.[7] His professional papers and drawings (1954–2003) are held in the archives at LSU’s Hill Memorial Library.[10]
Death[edit]
Desmond, who was retired, died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary in East Baton Rouge Parish. He was survived by his second wife, Nell Lentz-Desmond; a brother Gerald Desmond of Fremont, California; three children, John Michael Desmond (born January 1953) of Baton Rouge, James Russell Desmond (born October 1955) of New Orleans, and Margaret Desmond Dahm (born ca. 1960) of Asheville, North Carolina, and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his first wife and the mother of his children, the former Ella Blanche Russell of Magnolia in Pike County in southwestern Mississippi, and a sister, Eileen Desmond Kahn (1923–2002) of Wilmington, Delaware. He also had two stepdaughters, Sharon Elizabeth Lentz Moran and Jan Susan Lentz, both of Baton Rouge, and two stepsons, Paul Stephen Lentz (born December 1959) of Walker in Livingston Parish, and David Merrill Lentz (born June 1962) of Denham Springs, also in Livingston Parish. He had four grandchildren and five step-grandchildren. A mass of Christian burial was celebrated on March 31, 2008, at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church. Interment followed in Resthaven Gardens of Memory on the Old Jefferson Highway in Baton Rouge.[7]
Desmond's death came four months after the passing of another Louisiana architect, Hugh G. Parker, Jr., of Bastrop. Having overcome childhood polio, Parker in a 45-year career, designed such structures as the 16-story Wyly Tower of Learning at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, the Monroe/West Monroe Convention and Visitors Bureau, the football and baseball stadiums of the University of Louisiana at Monroe, Bastrop City Hall, and numerous churches and school buildings.[11]

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

John Jacob Desmond (April 5, 1922 – March 27, 2008) was an American architect in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who designed such public buildings as the Baton Rouge River Center, the Louisiana State University Student Union, Bluebonnet Swamp Interpretive Center, Louisiana Arts and Sciences Center, Louisiana State Archives, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State Library, and the Louisiana Naval Museum. He also designed the United States Embassy building in Monrovia, Liberia, the Lindy Boggs Center (named for former U.S. Representative Corrine "Lindy" Boggs) at his own alma mater, Tulane University in New Orleans, and the cafeteria at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, the principal city of Tangipahoa Parish.[1]
Desmond and his firm, Desmond, Miremont & Burks, later John Desmond and Associates,[2] also designed numerous churches, including Grace Memorial Episcopal Church in Hammond and St. Joseph's Cathedral, Westminster Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge,[3] Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church (his own congregation), and the Catholic Life Center, all in Baton Rouge.[4]

Early years, education, military[edit]
Desmond was born in Denver, Colorado, to Timothy J. Desmond and the former Rose Isabelle Dvorak (1886–1982),[5] but he lived most of his life in Hammond and Baton Rouge. He graduated from Hammond High School in 1937 and thereafter procured his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Tulane. He obtained a Master of Architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where he studied under the American Institute of Architects gold medal winners William Wurster and Alvar Aalto, a native of Finland.[6]
During World War II, Desmond served in the United States Navy as an ensign aboard the destroyer USS Madison (DD-425), which escorted convoys across the Atlantic. He saw action in the Battle of Anzio, Italy, in the Mediterranean. After the war, upon finishing his education, he worked for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York City, architect A. Hays Town in Baton Rouge, and for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1953, he returned to Hammond to open the first architectural practice in the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana. He was the Tangipahoa Parish School Board architect for some twenty years.[6]
Excellence in architecture[edit]
Allen Eskew, a New Orleans architect who was influenced by Desmond's style, told the reporter Jeremy Harper of the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate that Desmond was "really one of the giants of midcentury modern Louisiana architecture."[4] He could incorporate early Acadian design elements into modern structures. His pen-and-ink drawings have been exhibited across the nation and published internationally. He received a "Lifetime Achievement Award from the Louisiana chapter of the AIA. Desmond's firm held offices in Hammond and Baton Rouge until the 1970s, when he worked exclusively out of Baton Rouge. He also taught architecture at Tulane, LSU, and historically black Southern University in Baton Rouge. His drawings and photographs have been featured in numerous national and international magazines and have been exhibited in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and New York City.[7] His work is featured in his book, Louisiana’s Antebellum Architecture, published in 1970 by Claitor's in Baton Rouge.[8]
In 1986, the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awarded Desmond its most prestigious honor, the Preservation Award, which he received for focusing upon awareness of the past through his work as a preservationist and for his historically-influenced modern designs. Desmond was described as both "talented and generous-spirited." Eskew, one of the designers of the award-winning Louisiana State Museum in Baton Rouge, noted how Desmond was able to weave a "large building masterfully in a canopy of existing mature oaks" in the establishment of the LSU Student Union.[4]
Desmond was a fellow in the A.I.A. for "Significant Contribution to Design".[9] He was "Outstanding Alumnus" of the Tulane School of Architecture. He was cited for "Excellence in the Arts" by the Arts Council of the Mayor-President, combined Baton Rouge municipal and East Baton Rouge Parish office.[7] His professional papers and drawings (1954–2003) are held in the archives at LSU’s Hill Memorial Library.[10]
Death[edit]
Desmond, who was retired, died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary in East Baton Rouge Parish. He was survived by his second wife, Nell Lentz-Desmond; a brother Gerald Desmond of Fremont, California; three children, John Michael Desmond (born January 1953) of Baton Rouge, James Russell Desmond (born October 1955) of New Orleans, and Margaret Desmond Dahm (born ca. 1960) of Asheville, North Carolina, and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his first wife and the mother of his children, the former Ella Blanche Russell of Magnolia in Pike County in southwestern Mississippi, and a sister, Eileen Desmond Kahn (1923–2002) of Wilmington, Delaware. He also had two stepdaughters, Sharon Elizabeth Lentz Moran and Jan Susan Lentz, both of Baton Rouge, and two stepsons, Paul Stephen Lentz (born December 1959) of Walker in Livingston Parish, and David Merrill Lentz (born June 1962) of Denham Springs, also in Livingston Parish. He had four grandchildren and five step-grandchildren. A mass of Christian burial was celebrated on March 31, 2008, at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church. Interment followed in Resthaven Gardens of Memory on the Old Jefferson Highway in Baton Rouge.[7]
Desmond's death came four months after the passing of another Louisiana architect, Hugh G. Parker, Jr., of Bastrop. Having overcome childhood polio, Parker in a 45-year career, designed such structures as the 16-story Wyly Tower of Learning at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, the Monroe/West Monroe Convention and Visitors Bureau, the football and baseball stadiums of the University of Louisiana at Monroe, Bastrop City Hall, and numerous churches and school buildings.[11]

He obtained a Master of Architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where he studied under the American Institute of Architects gold medal winners William Wurster and Alvar Aalto, a native of Finland.[6]
During World War II, Desmond served in the United States Navy as an ensign aboard the destroyer USS Madison (DD-425), which escorted convoys across the Atlantic. He saw action in the Battle of Anzio, Italy, in the Mediterranean. After the war, upon finishing his education, he worked for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York City, architect A. Hays Town in Baton Rouge, and for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1953, he returned to Hammond to open the first architectural practice in the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana. He was the Tangipahoa Parish School Board architect for some twenty years.[6]
Excellence in architecture[edit]
Allen Eskew, a New Orleans architect who was influenced by Desmond's style, told the reporter Jeremy Harper of the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate that Desmond was "really one of the giants of midcentury modern Louisiana architecture."[4] He could incorporate early Acadian design elements into modern structures. His pen-and-ink drawings have been exhibited across the nation and published internationally. He received a "Lifetime Achievement Award from the Louisiana chapter of the AIA. Desmond's firm held offices in Hammond and Baton Rouge until the 1970s, when he worked exclusively out of Baton Rouge. He also taught architecture at Tulane, LSU, and historically black Southern University in Baton Rouge. His drawings and photographs have been featured in numerous national and international magazines and have been exhibited in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and New York City.[7] His work is featured in his book, Louisiana’s Antebellum Architecture, published in 1970 by Claitor's in Baton Rouge.[8]
In 1986, the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awarded Desmond its most prestigious honor, the Preservation Award, which he received for focusing upon awareness of the past through his work as a preservationist and for his historically-influenced modern designs. Desmond was described as both "talented and generous-spirited." Eskew, one of the designers of the award-winning Louisiana State Museum in Baton Rouge, noted how Desmond was able to weave a "large building masterfully in a canopy of existing mature oaks" in the establishment of the LSU Student Union.[4]
Desmond was a fellow in the A.I.A. for "Significant Contribution to Design".[9] He was "Outstanding Alumnus" of the Tulane School of Architecture. He was cited for "Excellence in the Arts" by the Arts Council of the Mayor-President, combined Baton Rouge municipal and East Baton Rouge Parish office.[7] His professional papers and drawings (1954–2003) are held in the archives at LSU’s Hill Memorial Library.[10]
Death[edit]
Desmond, who was retired, died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary in East Baton Rouge Parish. He was survived by his second wife, Nell Lentz-Desmond; a brother Gerald Desmond of Fremont, California; three children, John Michael Desmond (born January 1953) of Baton Rouge, James Russell Desmond (born October 1955) of New Orleans, and Margaret Desmond Dahm (born ca. 1960) of Asheville, North Carolina, and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his first wife and the mother of his children, the former Ella Blanche Russell of Magnolia in Pike County in southwestern Mississippi, and a sister, Eileen Desmond Kahn (1923–2002) of Wilmington, Delaware. He also had two stepdaughters, Sharon Elizabeth Lentz Moran and Jan Susan Lentz, both of Baton Rouge, and two stepsons, Paul Stephen Lentz (born December 1959) of Walker in Livingston Parish, and David Merrill Lentz (born June 1962) of Denham Springs, also in Livingston Parish. He had four grandchildren and five step-grandchildren. A mass of Christian burial was celebrated on March 31, 2008, at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church. Interment followed in Resthaven Gardens of Memory on the Old Jefferson Highway in Baton Rouge.[7]
Desmond's death came four months after the passing of another Louisiana architect, Hugh G. Parker, Jr., of Bastrop. Having overcome childhood polio, Parker in a 45-year career, designed such structures as the 16-story Wyly Tower of Learning at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, the Monroe/West Monroe Convention and Visitors Bureau, the football and baseball stadiums of the University of Louisiana at Monroe, Bastrop City Hall, and numerous churches and school buildings.[11]

Powder coating
Powder coating is unlike paint in that it is applied as a dry powder, hence its name. The powder is applied to the object using an electrostatic gun which is then heated to 200 °C. The heat enables the thermoset powder to melt and then to form a polymer of a greater molecular weight. This creates a coating of a uniform thickness without runs.
Powder coat is also eco-friendly as over-spray material is collected and re-used which apart from being non-wasteful means it is not allowed to enter the atmosphere. Also going towards its green credentials, unlike many commercial paints, powder coat does not contain solvents or Volatile Organic Compounds.





The benefits of powder coating over paint finishes

It does not peel or flake when the substrate is flexed
No solvents are used in the process of powder coating – this produces a low fire risk finish and is also eco-friendly
Powder coat adheres strongly to the substrate and is corrosion-resistant
A uniform coating thickness is achieved
Resistant to UV light fading
Resistant to acids, solvents and cleaning fluids.
