Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Old West Investment Management, LLC







































Welcome to Old West Investment Management
Old West Management, LLC was founded based on the values embodied in the Code of the West. Simply, we are committed to treating our investors as we ourselves would like to be treated. Aside from being the right thing to do, we believe that attracting a dedicated investor base provides a competitive advantage for us to enact our disciplined, long term, and often contrarian investment process.
Our focus is on investing in businesses run by management teams with large stock ownership, smart pay, and track records of successfully compounding shareholder value.  Further, we seek to buy into such businesses at discounted prices that offer us an attractive forward return with limited risk of capital loss.
To begin, we are always willing to discuss our current holdings and the research process behind them.  Just as we focus on investing with management teams who are heavily invested in their own companies, we want investors who expect the same of us.
Investment Strategies
Old West manages several strategies based upon the companies that we uncover through our simple yet sound investment process: large cap, small/mid cap, focused, long/short absolute return, and income.  These multiple investment strategies inform one another and create a process that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Further, they allow our investors to have access to our underlying research process with different portfolio risk/return dynamics.

Process : Old West Investment Management, LLC


























Investment Philosophy
Old West's investment philosophy stems from Ben Graham's classic observation that "investing is most intelligent when it is most business-like". That means that we don't view stocks or bonds as financial instruments that trade up or down; instead, we view them as equivalent to private ownership or creditor stakes in the underlying businesses. Simply, we consider ourselves businesspeople who merely transact through publicly-traded securities.
In every investment we make, we seek a large margin of safety in terms of price paid relative to business value received. Buying at a large discount to intrinsic business value not only offers a magnified prospective return but more importantly provides a buffer against all the things that can and often do go wrong. Our perspective is that if we focus on the downside, the upside will take care of itself.
Investment Process
A focus on people forms the core of Old West's investment process. As a first principle, we believe that the soundest way to protect and grow our capital is by aligning ourselves with management teams who have high stock ownership and smart pay. It is our contention that incentives matter deeply, and that there is no surer way to understand the character and motivation of a management team than to study how they get paid. In the five minutes that it takes us to look at stock ownership, pay levels, and the business metrics that drive incentive pay, we are able to intelligently eliminate over 90% of the potential companies that would otherwise absorb much of our time and resources.
As a first principle, we believe that the soundest way to protect and grow our capital is by aligning ourselves with management teams who have high stock ownership and smart pay. 
Before we dig into our company specific analysis, we source and sort potential investments through several intuitive filters that also relate to people.
First, we monitor every purchase or sale of stock by insiders, every day. If a CEO and several directors purchase millions of dollars of their own stock in the public markets, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment, but it does mean that we should print out the proxy and annual report to see if we can see what they do.
Second, every quarter, we will mine and reverse engineer the publicly-filed holdings of those that we consider to be the world's top investors. Once again, the presence of successful investors or businesspeople doesn't mean that we too should automatically invest in any given company, but it does make us want to investigate further, using our own investment criteria, to see if we can see what they do.  If we find one idea per quarter in the two weeks of time that this takes, the process has paid for itself.
Third, we seek out and talk to people - from CEOs to salespeople, both current and former - to better understand the dynamics in their particular industries.  We also read industry periodicals and attend trade shows as a way to better understand potential investments. 
Finally, we will look at "special situations," such as companies with complicated accounting that masks their underlying value, where we can understand why the company is structurally misunderstood and mispriced.
Once we decide to dig into a company, we focus our work on management analysis, financial analysis, industry analysis, and qualitative analysis.



Management Analysis
The cornerstone of any investment analysis rests on a thorough understanding of the character, incentives, and experience of the management team that will be in control of our capital.Click here for more


Financial Analysis
Old West seeks  to rigorously understand a company’s current and past financial condition as a  way to ground our view about the underlying business and the returns we can  expect as an owner of that business.Click here for more

Qualitative Analysis
Through  qualitative analysis, Old West aims to connect our financial work to real world  economics and understanding.Click here for more






Qualitative Analysis
Through  qualitative analysis, Old West aims to connect our financial work to real world  economics and understanding.  Simply, how  does the firm make money?  What value  proposition do they fill and to whom? What are the unit economics?  For example, if we are looking at a retailer,  we will begin by understanding the unit economics of an individual store.  What does it cost to take out a lease, build  out the store, fill it with inventory, advertise, staff it with employees, and  pay for the utilities?  Then, what level  of sales is sustainable for that individual store?  Using these figures we can calculate the cash  on cash payback of opening a new store and the returns on capital of operating  the store. 
Next, perhaps  the most critical question we ask ourselves is what makes this business  sustainable?  The business world is  fiercely competitive and without the presence of identifiable and meaningful  barriers to entry, returns on capital above a company’s cost of capital should  be expected to diminish over time.  To  illustrate, let’s assume a company has invested capital of $100 and is  projected to be able to earn $20/year or a 20% return on capital.  At 10-15X cash flow, the market would place a  value between $200-300 on that business.   Simply, if an entrepreneur can recreate that business, she will invest  $100 in order to create that $200-300 of market value.  As more entrepreneurs enter, marginal returns  should be driven down, so that our company can instead earn closer to $10/year  or a 10% return on capital.  
What then,  makes a business sustainable?  There are  several types of barriers to entry that may permit a company to earn  sustainably high rates of return on its capital: regulatory (such as a license  holder like GTECH), network effect (an exchange like EBay), or brand power with  scale (Coca Cola) to name a few.  When we  see a company earning attractive rates of return on its capital, we  relentlessly focus on how we could kill the business.  If we had an unlimited amount of capital and  time, could we successfully enter into their business and markets?  How could we steal customers and at what  cost?  After focusing on the business  economics and their defensibility, we aim to combine our work into a cohesive  thesis.  In doing so, we will seek to  answer two simple questions: is the business misvalued?  And, more importantly, why is it misvalued?




Industry Analysis
Industry  analysis allows Old West to contextualize our company specific work within the  larger industrial ecosystem that it operates in.  How is the ecosystem vertically and  horizontally organized?  What are the  economic and financial characteristics of each segment of the ecosystem?  For example, what segments and which  companies capture the best margins and returns on capital?  How have those changed over time and what are  the economic drivers?  How is customer or  supplier concentration changing, what is the threat of technological  substitution?  How do competitors compete  with each other?  
Understanding  the larger industrial ecosystem enlightens simple financial analysis with  rigorous fieldwork and scuttlebutt.   Speaking with customers, competitors, and suppliers, reading industry  publications, and attending industry conferences allow us to understand the  fundamental industrial forces that will shape individual company  performance.  




Management Analysis
The cornerstone of any investment analysis rests on a thorough understanding of the character, incentives, and experience of the management team that will be in control of our capital.  Andre Meyer, the late Senior Partner of Lazard Frères, put it succinctly: “Business, real business, is not numbers and it’s not money.  It’s people.  You have to be able to know and judge people.”  

Old West’s goal is to invest alongside proven owner/managers as silent partners. When we buy shares in a business, we are purchasing a stake in its current balance sheet and a claim on the future cash flows that balance sheet can generate.  The process by which that business value will grow is a direct function of management’s approach to capital allocation.  It is hard to overemphasize how important this is.  In the course of a decade, an average business, through re-investment, will replace nearly every asset it owns.  As the value of our investment will be the result of those future re-investment decisions, we will only invest with managers who we unequivocally trust and respect.  That said, there is no single and quantifiable data source to vet such issues.  Instead, it requires a fluid and qualitative analysis that considers past actions and current incentives as a way to understand how management will make future decisions.




Financial Analysis
Old West seeks  to rigorously understand a company’s current and past financial condition as a  way to ground our view about the underlying business and the returns we can  expect as an owner of that business.  
We begin with a  company’s balance sheet to understand what they own and what they owe.  Generally, we focus on profitable companies  with little debt.  Once we know the  amount of capital deployed in the business, we then focus on determining what  cash earnings that capital is able to produce after stripping out all  expenditures necessary to maintain the business.  In estimating the company’s cash generative  ability, we focus on the underlying, bottom-up drivers – garnered from our  industry and qualitative work – to project what the company can earn in the  present and the future.  Then, crucially,  we connect the projected cash flows back to the capital that drives them by  computing the company’s returns on capital. 
What are the  returns on assets, equity, and incremental capital?  What have they been historically and does  that mesh with what we are contemplating for the future?  How does this compare to peers’ financial and  capital characteristics?  Finally, how  would we think about valuing the underlying assets and associated cash flows  under a range of industrial scenarios?

Operations : Old West Investment Management, LLC


























Business Operations
In the investment business, a majority of investment firm failures stem from operational shortcomings and not poor investment performance.  As such, Old West believes that we have an obligation to focus as much time and effort on our operational systems and processes as we do on analyzing the companies that we invest in.
The mission of Business Operations is to treat our clients as we ourselves would like to be treated; execute effectively and efficiently, report accurately and timely, and respect all clients equally. 
The purpose of Business Operations at Old West is three-fold:

Execute the investment strategy as determined by the Investment Team
Fulfill obligations for regulatory compliance
Develop and maintain client relationships

Our mission is to treat our clients as we ourselves would like to be treated; execute effectively and efficiently, report accurately and timely, and respect all clients equally.
What does this mean for our clients? It means that we will never put our own interests ahead of our clients’ and that no client is more important than another. It also means that we will create processes that minimize operational risk and place a focus on building out infrastructure designed to return timely and relevant information to our clients.
Old West Investment Management utilizes a straight through process that creates a seamless workflow from portfolio construction through trade settlement. Our integrated processes support our philosophy in putting clients’ interests first so that we can pass on lower overall costs and best execution. We do not make a market in securities and so we are not conflicted with how, when, and where we trade an account. In addition, we take pride in doing our own research, as noted within the Investment Process section, and will never support the costs of this research with soft-dollar arrangements.
In addition to the above, we also take pride in the information and materials we make available to our clients.  We tirelessly evaluate this information for usefulness and relevancy while continuing to explore new ways of getting information into the hands of our clients.  The result of this effort is a consolidated report package that we make available to our clients on a quarterly basis.
We demand the same of ourselves as we demand of the owner-managers we seek to invest in through our Investment Process, and ultimately would like to operate a company that we ourselves would deem worthy of investment if our shares were publicly traded.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Old West Investment Management, LLC







































Welcome to Old West Investment Management
Old West Management, LLC was founded based on the values embodied in the Code of the West. Simply, we are committed to treating our investors as we ourselves would like to be treated. Aside from being the right thing to do, we believe that attracting a dedicated investor base provides a competitive advantage for us to enact our disciplined, long term, and often contrarian investment process.
Our focus is on investing in businesses run by management teams with large stock ownership, smart pay, and track records of successfully compounding shareholder value.  Further, we seek to buy into such businesses at discounted prices that offer us an attractive forward return with limited risk of capital loss.
To begin, we are always willing to discuss our current holdings and the research process behind them.  Just as we focus on investing with management teams who are heavily invested in their own companies, we want investors who expect the same of us.
Investment Strategies
Old West manages several strategies based upon the companies that we uncover through our simple yet sound investment process: large cap, small/mid cap, focused, long/short absolute return, and income.  These multiple investment strategies inform one another and create a process that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Further, they allow our investors to have access to our underlying research process with different portfolio risk/return dynamics.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
