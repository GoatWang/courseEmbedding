Our Latest Global Insights




 





Videos: 
Global Markets: Looking Ahead In 2017
 "In contrast to the short lived spurts of economic activity in earlier years that were limited to select regions, the ongoing global recovery has become broader, covering most parts of the world. We are maintaining a reflation-oriented posture with above-average exposure to the energy, financials, industrials and materials sectors, given our Investment Committee’s view that commodity prices should remain meaningfully higher than they were in the first half of 2016."
See Video













Videos: 
2017 Market Outlook
 "Our investment analysts are finding that CEOs seem to be responding to a growing attitude that this is time to focus on growth opportunities again, and to restart long-delayed expansion projects. We feel this reinvigorated business attitude should accelerate earnings growth in 2017."
See Video













White Papers: 
Market Outlook 2017: Reflating The Low Growth World
Even in the face of unanticipated upheavals, the global economic growth outlook has brightened. Eurozone and Japan are gaining momentum. The robust rebound in energy and commodity prices is helping resource exporters such as Brazil and Russia and in the rest of the emerging world, healthy domestic demand should stabilize growth rates in the short to medium term.
Read More














Global Overviews: 
Healthier Europe and Japan brightens global outlook
Global equity prices advanced at the beginning of the year, helped by the improved economic growth outlook and the prospect of better earnings growth. Prices of industrial materials such as iron ore resumed the uptrend and helped equity markets in Latin America outperform during the month. Global manufacturing activity strengthened further in January, helped by gains in major economies including the U.S., China and the Eurozone.

White Papers: 
Industry Spotlight: Healthcare
The global healthcare sector is facing headwinds in the form of regulatory overhaul and tighter pricing negotiations by populist governments, especially in the U.S. Despite these short to medium term uncertainties, the long-term demand outlook for the sector remains robust. The long-term demand outlook is brighter in emerging countries, where healthcare consumption is still very low. Growing incomes and rising health awareness could boost demand, especially in countries with large populations that would allow sufficient operational scale and efficiencies.

Country Profiles:
Taiwan: Asia’s Technology Hotspot
Taiwan, the East Asian island that has close political and economic ties with China, has made a name for itself in the field of global electronics manufacturing. Taiwan formed a network of notebook-PC manufacturers in the late 80s that made its products household names across the world. Yet, the relationship between the Middle Kingdom and Taiwan is fraught with mutual distrust that weighs on Taiwan’s economic prospects. In fact, China’s stranglehold over its neighbor is so complete that Taiwan has official bilateral trade deals only with Singapore and New Zealand, nations with which China too has trade ties.

About Thomas White
The Unique Thomas White Firm Culture



At Thomas White, our investing performance goal is straightforward: to outperform our benchmarks in the long-term and especially during market declines. We feel the surest path to accomplish these goals is to become an exceptional research organization. To meet these objectives, our professionals need to understand corporations, investor behavior and portfolio design better than our peers.



Our veterans feel the primary reason for our success has been the pride we derive from having our research produce excellent performance. This positive outlook explains why we continue to expand our global research and product capabilities.


A 24-Hour Think-tank




We believe that an ethnically and culturally diverse team, having varied academic and professional training, is better equipped to understand the increasingly complex global investment environment.
Located in our offices in the United States and Asia, the Thomas White research team works together as a highly productive 24-hour think tank.
Our investment professionals are trained by the investment committee members, who have worked together as a team on average for over a decade.

Our Latest Insights From The Asia Pacific



 








Economy trends update April 2017:
Emerging Asia Pacific 
During the first quarter, the majority of the eight economies under our coverage in the Emerging Asia Pacific region reported better-than-expected economic data. In China, growth accelerated and became more broad-based. But India and the Philippines lost momentum. The other economies, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, picked up speed on the back of stronger exports.

Economy trends update April 2017
Developed Asia Pacific 
The uptick in consumer spending and the increase in exports gave a boost to economic growth in Japan, the largest of the economies under our coverage in the Developed Asia region. Resources exporter Australia unveiled a massive 10-year infrastructure building program to kick-start economic growth as the commodities-led boom fades. The export-oriented economy of Singapore continued to benefit from the pick-up in global demand.

Taiwan: Asia’s Technology Hotspot
Taiwan, the East Asian island that has close political and economic ties with China, has made a name for itself in the field of global electronics manufacturing. Taiwan formed a network of notebook-PC manufacturers in the late 80s that made its products household names across the world. Yet, the relationship between the Middle Kingdom and Taiwan is fraught with mutual distrust that weighs on Taiwan’s economic prospects.

Country Profile:
Singapore: Serviced by Industry and Finance
For a country which originally made its name as a trade entrepot, exports are crucial to Singapore's growth.  The economy, which started off with exports of textiles and basic electronic goods in the 70s, graduated to biotech, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductor exports in the 90s.Singapore has emerged as the fourth-largest offshore financial center in the world.

Country Profile:
Indonesia: Democracy Powers Growth
Diverse, myriad hues have colored this nation, offering such cultural variety and geographical complexity that a journey to Indonesia is a tryst with nature. With a varied tapestry of colors, Indonesia, like many countries in the South East Asian region, was traumatized by a destructive past – yet not destroyed.
Read More











Country Profile:
Japan: Asian Power Looking To Rise Again
Nothing merits more attention than Japan’s long-standing debt problem. Deflation, a situation where there is a fall in the general price levels, as opposed to inflation, has been the bane of the Japanese economy.Educational reforms, too, are likely needed to improve the economy’s productivity, with more investment required in pre-primary education as well as in university education.

Country Profile:
Hong Kong: China’s Laboratory
Notwithstanding certain challenges, the small fishing harbor of yesteryear has established itself as an oasis of free market in an otherwise chaotic Asia. The soothing breeze of democracy may well be the tailwind which Hong Kong badly needs.

The New Global











Global Markets: Looking Ahead In 2017
 "In contrast to the short lived spurts of economic activity in earlier years that were limited to select regions, the ongoing global recovery has become broader, covering most parts of the world. We are maintaining a reflation-oriented posture with above-average exposure to the energy, financials, industrials and materials sectors, given our Investment Committee’s view that commodity prices should remain meaningfully higher than they were in the first half of 2016."See Video






Video: 2017 Market Outlook
 "Our investment analysts are finding that CEOs seem to be responding to a growing attitude that this is time to focus on growth opportunities again, and to restart long-delayed expansion projects. We feel this reinvigorated business attitude should accelerate earnings growth in 2017."See Video






White Paper:
Reflating The Low Growth World
Even in the face of unanticipated upheavals, the global economic growth outlook has brightened. Eurozone and Japan are gaining momentum. The robust rebound in energy and commodity prices is helping resource exporters such as Brazil and Russia and in the rest of the emerging world, healthy domestic demand should stabilize growth rates in the short to medium term.Learn More




White Paper: Healthcare
The global healthcare sector is facing headwinds in the form of regulatory overhaul and tighter pricing negotiations by populist governments, especially in the U.S. Despite these short to medium term uncertainties, the long-term demand outlook for the sector remains robust. The long-term demand outlook is brighter in emerging countries, where healthcare consumption is still very low.Learn More
