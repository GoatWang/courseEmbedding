Apollo Announces Pricing Of $250 Million In Preferred Shares






Business Wire




Feb 28, 2017 4:08 PM EST













 


















































  Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Apollo") today announced the pricing of a $250.0 million offering of 10,000,000 of its 6.375% Series A Preferred Shares representing limited liability company interests with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In addition, Apollo has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Series A Preferred Shares solely to cover over-allotments. The offering is expected to close on March 7, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.  Apollo intends to contribute the net proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Shares for general corporate purposes to its indirect subsidiaries, Apollo Principal Holdings I, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings II, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings III, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings IV, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings V, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings VI, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings VII, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings VIII, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings IX, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings X, L.P., Apollo Principal Holdings XI, LLC, Apollo Principal Holdings XII, L.P. and AMH Holdings (Cayman), L.P.  Distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares, when and if declared by AGM Management, LLC, Apollo's manager, will be paid quarterly and are non-cumulative.  Apollo intends to apply to list the Series A Preferred Shares on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "APO PR A".  BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS Investment Bank and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets are acting as joint lead managers for the offering, and Academy Securities and Lebenthal Capital Markets are acting as co-managers for the offering.  This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Series A Preferred Shares or any other securities, and does not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration and qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. A shelf registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and has become effective.
