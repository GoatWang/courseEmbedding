The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

	United States Natural Gas Fund, LP ETF (UNG): The Quick Guide to UNG
While UNG is the biggest natural gas ETF, it's probably not the best way to play the commodity.

Count natural gas among the commodities that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have made more accessible to everyday investors. Among natural gas ETFs, the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP ETF (NYSEARCA:UNG) is the bellwether.

Prior to the ETF boom, investors had to turn to single stocks or ultra-volatile futures to gain exposure to the natural gas. That is no longer the case as exchange-traded products have made natural gas just as accessible as gold or silver.
In fact, UNG is the largest futures-based natural gas ETF in the U.S. and with almost $457 million in assets under management, UNG is bigger than several of its direct competitors on a combined basis.
UNG “offers straightforward exposure to front-month natural gas futures, rolling expiring front-month contracts to the next-nearest month,” according to ETF.com.
Like a leveraged ETF, this fund is an instrument best used by sophisticated traders with the ability to monitor positions on a daily basis.
The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet
“The investment objective of UNG is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ net NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, La., as measured by the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UNG’s expenses,” according to United States Commodity Funds, the ETF’s issuer. “UNG invests primarily in listed natural gas futures contracts and other natural gas related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less.”
UNG Has a Lot in Common With USO
Like its oil counterpart, the United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSEARCA:USO), UNG rolls over derivatives and futures exposure. That runs costs up (UNG has a total expense ratio of 1.27%) and means the fund’s returns do not necessarily mirror those of spot natural gas prices.
The methodology of ETFs such as UNG and USO also increases the potential for contango, the scenario where an investor pays more for front-month futures than what the market is expecting the commodity in question will trade at several months in the future.
While UNG is liquid with tight spreads and average daily volume of almost $88 million in dollar terms, its construction is not conducive to long-term holding.
The fund’s five-year returns are abysmal, losing 65% of its value during that stretch.
As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

United States Natural Gas Fund, LP(NYSE:UNG): 2.6% Plunge Is Worst Among All ETFs | ETF Daily News

































 



























































U.S. Natural Gas Fund Hammered Again Amid Weak Price Forecast


 February 10, 2017 5:49pm  NYSE:UNG  



 




The United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (UNG) underperformed all other non-leveraged, non-inverse exchange traded products in the U.S. today on a percentage basis, producing a -2.56% one-day return and trailing the wider markets by a total of 2.95 percentage points.




Behind The Losses
UNG closed today at $7.60 per share, down $0.20 (-2.56%). Putting this move in context, the S&P 500 index — largely considered the most popular and useful benchmark for equity performance — closed up $0.91 (+0.39%) on the day.
UNG’s trading volume today was a total of 8,129,774 shares, which was a decrease of 28% versus its average daily trading volume of 11,274,659. Rising trading volume generally an indicator of increased demand for a particular security, and is typically associated with a specific news event or trend that draws investors into or out of specific asset classes, or sectors or subsectors within those classes.
Including any dividends as well as today’s losses, UNG has now fallen a total of -18.63% year-to-date, versus a 3.57% gain in the S&P 500 during the same timeframe.
A Look Under The Hood
United States Natural Gas Fund, LP is a Commodity-focused product issued by U.S. Commodity Funds. Its expense ratio of 0.60% makes it the #24 cheapest ETF among 120 total funds in the Commodity ETFs category.
UNG currently boasts $532.93M in assets under management (AUM), placing it #15 of 120 ETFs in its category, and #441 of 1916 total ETFs in the U.S. exchange traded universe.
The investment objective of the United States Natural Gas Fund seeks to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract. The fund invests primarily in futures contracts for natural gas that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange or other U.S. and foreign exchanges. The Benchmark Futures Contract is the futures contract on natural gas as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration.
With natural gas prices hit hard today amid a warming weather forecast for much of the U.S., UNG has clearly resumed its bearish downturn.
UNG SMART Grade
UNG currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #77 of 121 funds in the Commodity ETFs category.
