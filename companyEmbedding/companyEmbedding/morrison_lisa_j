                        So okay, Greenhead isn't PERFECT and neither am I. They're still one of the best around, though, and way better than any dispensary in Portland.

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (the “Company”) and
LISA J. MORRISON (the “Executive”).
The Company and the Executive are sometimes referred to

an employment agreement effective as of June 1, 2001 which was
amended and restated as of January 1, 2002 and January 1,
2005.

The Parties intend to modify, amend
and restate the employment contract as provided herein.

 

 
 
Now therefore
in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the promises
contained herein the Parties agree as follows:
 

1.
  
EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES
.

 
 
1.1
 
Employment
. During the Contract Term (as
defined herein), the Company will employ the Executive and the
Executive will serve the Company as a full-time employee upon and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
Executive’s employment hereunder may be terminated before the
end of the Contract Term only as provided in Section 5 of this
Agreement.
 
1.2
 
Position and
Responsibilities .
Executive has been elected to serve as Senior Vice President -
Leasing and, during the Executive’s employment hereunder, her
primary duties, functions, responsibilities and authority will be
to oversee the Company’s leasing activities. Further,
Executive shall perform such other duties as are assigned to her by
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and/or the
Board of Directors.
 
1.3
 
Time and Effort
. During the Contract Term,
Executive shall be employed on a full-time basis and shall devote
her best efforts and substantially all of her attention, business
time and effort (excluding sick leave, vacation provided for herein
and reasonable time devoted to civic and charitable activities) to
the business and affairs of the Company.
 
2.
 
   
 
PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT
.
 
2.1
 
Initial Term
.
 
(a)
 
Initial Term
. The period of employment pursuant
to this Agreement shall begin on January 1, 2006 and shall extend
to the close of business on December 31, 2007 (the "Initial Term"),
unless earlier terminated as provided in Section 5 or extended as

year thereafter during the Contract Term is sometimes herein
referred to as a “Contract Year”.
 







(b)

parties, prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Extended Term,
the Contract Term may be extended for additional one year periods
beginning on the anniversary of the Effective Date (sometimes
herein referred to as an “Extended Term”) upon such
terms and conditions as the parties may agree. References herein to
the "Contract Term" of this Agreement shall refer to the Initial
Term as extended pursuant to this Section.
 





3.


COMPENSATION





 
3.1
 
Base Salary
. As compensation for
Executive’s services performed pursuant to this Agreement,
Company will pay her an “Annual Base Salary” of
$210,000.00 for the Contract Year beginning January 1, 2006. The
Annual Base Salary shall be paid in equal installments in arrears
in accordance with Company's regular pay schedule.
 
3.2
 
Bonus Compensation
. For the Contract Year beginning
January 1, 2006, in addition to her Annual Base Salary, Executive
will be paid an annual bonus (“Annual Bonus”) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) seventy-five percent (75%) of
Executive’s Annual Base Salary in effect on the last day of
such Contract Year and (ii) an amount equal to the total
“Qualifying Bonus Compensation” (as defined below) of
“Qualified Leasing Representatives” (as defined below)
paid with respect to that Contract Year divided by the number of
Qualified Leasing Representatives for that Contract Year (with a
Qualified Leasing Representative employed for less than the full
Contract Year included as a fraction equal to the fraction of the
Contract Year that he or she was a Qualified Leasing
Representative).
 
For purposes of
this Agreement the following terms shall have the meanings set
forth below:
 
“Qualified Leasing Representative”,
with respect to any Contract Year, shall mean (i) a person who was
employed by the Company as a leasing representative and reported to
Executive for at least six months during that Contract Year and
(ii) a person hired during such Contract Year for a special leasing
project who is designated as a Qualified Leasing Representative by
the Company by notice to Executive within thirty (30) days of the
commencement of such person’s employment. For purposes of
this Agreement, Beth Lippincott will not be considered a
“Qualified Leasing Representative”.
 
“Qualifying Bonus Compensation”,
with respect to any Contract Year, shall mean the amount by which
(i) the commissions payable to Qualified Leasing Representatives
with respect to that Contract Year computed as a percentage of
average annual tenant rents (net of tenant allowances) in
accordance with the Company’s bonus compensation plan exceeds
(ii) the base compensation of such Qualifying Leasing
Representatives for that Contract Year.
 







For purposes of
illustration only, if this Section 3.2 had been in effect for the
calendar year 2005, Executive’s bonus for that calendar year
would have been as follows:

CLAUSES
Search Contract Clauses >>
Browse Contract Clause Library>>





An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
