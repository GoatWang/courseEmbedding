 E-CHANNEL FRAME


The most important part of building a structure is the foundation. Our floating dock designs begin with our E-channel extrusions that run the length of the dock creating a fully welded box for superior strength and rigidity.




 FULLY WELDED


In the marine industry, many companies 'spot weld' metal docks. Gator does not cut corners in our build process. The fully welded frame provides added strength and durability to Gator's dock designs.




 ALUMINUM DECKING


Our aluminum decking is textured in two planes for maximum slip resistance. It is a workhorse favorite offering high performance without the maintenance in salty marine environments. The aluminum decking is incorporated into our dock frames for added structural integrity.




 FULL FLOAT


The rugged, fully encased aluminum float frame and solid foam core of the GatorDock Full Float is designed to meet the challenging criteria of the most demanding projects in the marine industry. In addition to the superior stability and durability this float provides, it can also achieve the lowest freeboard height.




 PILE GUIDES


Our floating docks are fitted with durable anchoring options which have been tested over the last few decades. Our internal or external four roller pile guides have thousands of marine access projects worth of proven performance.




 UTILITY BAYS


The design of the aluminum E-channel frame and decking provides a clear utility bay on each of our docks and piers. Utility access panels can be incorporated into the decking of your dock for easy access to utility lines.

Boat Ramps
Public Boat Ramp Docks for Busy Launches
GatorDocks have been used for everything from floating helicopter pads and VIP party decks to marine research centers. Most often however, our docks are a used as a transition from land to boat. Cruise liners, ferries, and water taxis use Gator products every day to safely board and disembark passengers. Public boat launches across the country feature Gator's floating boat ramps to handle large crowds of weekend boaters. Learn more about our boat dock systems below.

High Traffic or Commercial Boat Launches

Boat Ramp Docks
Along America's coasts and lakesides, Gator aluminum boat ramps launch thousands of boats every weekend. Our innovative boat launch designs have become industry standards. We are often asked to speak at seminars and conventions on the features that make our aluminum boat ramp designs stand up to the increasing traffic and growing vessel size. If your project needs to take the abuse of high traffic in a public setting, GatorDock can help you with your design and product needs.
 

Passenger Loading Docks
Another popular use for GatorDock boat launches include passenger loading platforms for tourism or commercial vessels. Heavy duty loading platforms have been designed by Gator's team of engineers and craftsmen. Add snaking gangway systems to efficiently handle arrival and departing passengers.


Planning the Boat Ramp for Your Project's Need

Boat Ramp
The benefit of a Gator boat ramp is in the unique features based on your project's environment. From our naragansett hinge to unique pile guide designs, our 40+ years of experience and thousands of installed structures make us the experts in boat ramp designs.
 

Public Boat Launch
For public boat launch designs, we recommend our full float or incorporating a ground out cage with one of our other dock floatation styles. The standard features of our fully welded aluminum dock frames including gusseted corners and integrated aluminum decking will keep your launch in service for a long time.
 

Passenger Loading Dock
Large boat launch areas often prefer to keep their boat ramp lanes and passenger pick-up areas separate. Passengers and items can be safely loaded from a designated passenger loading dock after the watercraft has been launched from the boat ramp. Minimize congestion at your busy boat launch with this specialized dock design. 
 

Ferry Loading Platform
Water taxi and ferry operators love the stability and durability of Gator's floating docks for their passenger loading platforms. Aluminum gangway systems and gates safely keep passengers in designated areas during vessel docking.

Boat Ramp Options & Accessories
+ decking+ accessories+ anchoring






aluminum
The decking options for Gator's aluminum frame boat ramps are the same as our dock and pier structures. Aluminum decking creates a safe, long lasting surface perfect for busy public dock systems.


wood and composite
We offer several different wood decking options including pressure treated pine, ipe hardwood, and composite wood. The project's loading and aesthetic needs will help determine which wood dock decking you need.




other
Other decking styles including our multiple grating options and concrete are also available on our boat ramp designs.


Synthetic Concrete
Our synthetic concrete deck is GatorDock's newest design option. This light-weight, maintenance-free deck is a perfect compliment to our aluminum docks. Get the look of concrete and the deck strength you need without all the weight and cost. The FRP panels are installed prior to shipment of our prefabricated designs.









Dock Accessories
Any of the accessories available with our fixed or floating dock systems are also available on our aluminum boat ramps.


Utilities
Lighting, water lines, and electricity, as well as any other utilities your project may need, can be encompassed within your custom boat launch dock.




Railing & Gates
Gator offers many different rail styles as a safety feature on our docks or as an approach rail. Our design engineers can also build custom gates or security features for your project.


ADA Access
A majority of our designs already encompass ADA compliant features. However, if there is accessibility concern with your future dock project, Gator's designers and project managers can show you several past project solutions that will help achieve ADA compliance on your marine access system.









Fixed Supports
Boat ramps that are fixed will have the same support options as our fixed piers. If you are looking to use existing supports, Gator can also fabricate a system that can be retrofitted into the existing structure.


Floating Supports
Pile guides and piling are the most popular support style for floating boat ramp docks. Other options include various land connections and sea-floor anchor systems.

Applications
All of our designs start with the same rigid E-Channel frame.  The future use of the structure, or application, determines what we do to it next. Do you need a low-freeboard kayak launch? Then we will design and build our Full Float floatation system and incorporate one of our kayak cradles into the top dock design. Do you need a boat ramp? The E-frame channel is fitted with our Pontoon Float system and decked with slip-resistant aluminum decking. Choose your application below to start the design process of your dock, gangway or marina system.


Dock
We build beautiful docks. Our dock systems are used in commercial environments and are much more heavy duty than residential docks. Some of our dock systems, including our theme park marina systems, serve millions of people a year. We offer three floatation options for floating docks and several fixed dock support options.
 

Marina
Whether you are looking for a fixed marina, floating marina or a combination of the two, Gator's team of expert design engineers and fabricators can build a durable, low maintenance marina system designed specifically for your environment. Designer options, such as decking, lighting and utilities can be incorporated into your marina plans.
 

Pier
Gator builds piers that are a favorite for fishermen of all sizes and abilities. Our signature fishing rail is one of our clients' favorite design options. For heavy duty pier structures, ask about Gator's Lake Hartwell Pier project for inspiration. The major benefit of building your pier with an aluminum frame is it requires half the support pilings that a wood pier would need.
 

Gangway
Our gangways are a favorite in the marine industry. Even other dock builders ask us to build Gator gangways for them. Our E-Channel frames provide unmatched stability. Additionally, our dedication to fully welding connections gives our clients the longest lasting, quality gangways for their projects.
 

Launch System
Gator has been fabricating kayak launch docks for decades. We offer three standard designs to accommodate all types of specialty watercraft. Each of these standard designs can be customized with our design options to create the ideal non-motorized boat launch.
 

Boat Ramp
The entire Eastern Coast of the United States is dotted with Gator Pontoon Float Boat Ramps. Coastal boat launches can take a beating from waves, wind and even the boats being launched. Our rigid aluminum frames and durable aluminum cased floats keep maintenance requirements at a minimum even in the harsh salt-water environment. Gator has led the way in creating durable design features, such as the Naraganset hinge and knee brace, that make our boat ramp docks a favorite for state and municipality engineers.

Docks
Floating and Fixed Docks
Whether the tide is high or low, a floating boat dock will rise or fall to create a smooth transition into your watercraft. GatorDock offers three different types of floatation on our docks: the full float, the pontoon float, and the poly-tub float. Learn about these options and choose your dock design below or watch our floatation overview video in our resource library.  At Gator, we call our floating marine access structures 'docks' and we call our fixed structures 'piers.' To learn more about fixed dock systems, visit our pier section.

Whether Floating or Fixed, Make Your Docks Aluminum

Full Float
The full float's rugged, fully encased aluminum float with polyurethane is designed to meet the challenging criteria of the most intricate projects. The fully welded frame provides unmatched stability and durability in the harsh marine environment. From extreme tidal fluctuations to heavy fetch from coastal waterways, no other floating dock system in the world out-performs the GatorDock Full Float System.
 

Pontoon Float
During our decades of research and development we invented the pontoon floating dock. Using a proprietary polyurethane injection system, the aluminum float shells are filled with durable foam. It is important to note that both the Full Float and the Pontoon Float use polyurethane foam rather than polystyrene for buoyancy. Whereas polystyrene foam (similar to styrofoam) can dissolve and degrade when exposed to common chemicals found in marine environments, our polyurethane foam will remain intact even if exposed to boat fuels and marine chemicals. Gator Pontoon docks are ideally suited for areas with moderate traffic and are popular on boat ramp docks.
 

Poly-Tub Float
These economical plastic tubs are filled with polystyrene foam and bolted to the dock frame. Whereas the aluminum casings for the Full Float and Pontoon floatation systems are welded on the aluminum frames, the bolt on feature of the Poly-Tubs mean they can be replaced in the field. Ask Gator about incorporating a groundout cage into your Poly-Tub float design to protect the plastic casing during potential impact.


Designing Dock Solutions

Floating Dock
Whether your dock is used for fishing, swimming, or boat access, Gator can fabricate a system specific to your needs. Start designing your float dock by choosing a floatation style above then decking and accessories from below. GatorDock has been making long-lasting, durable floating docks for decades. Start your project by filling out the contact us form.
 

Fixed Dock
For areas with little tide fluctuation or shallow water, a fixed dock system can be designed. Rather than choose a flotation type, your dock will be fitted with header kits and pilings for support. Enhance your fixed dock design with fenders, bumpers, cleats and utilities to create a fixed boat dock or add railing to create a fishing dock.
 

Boat Dock
Gator can provide you with standard design options for your favorite boating interest including motorboats, kayaks, canoes, sailboats, rowing hulls, and other personal watercraft. Any design can be modified by changing the flotation type, decking, or accessories. When designing a dock to accommodate boat traffic, internal pile guides are often used to anchor the dock.
 

Modular Dock Systems
Most of our dock systems are intended to be permanent. Some of our clients want to move the location of their docks or create multiple layout options with our aluminum dock sections. Gator can design a modular dock system specific to your use and site needs.

Dock Options & Accessories
+ decking+ accessories+ anchoring






Aluminum Non-Slip Decking
This economical decking option comes standard on our floating dock designs. Bare feet will appreciate that the aluminum deck boards are textured for slip resistance and remain cool to the touch even in strong sun. This low maintenance decking option is optimal for salt water or brackish water environments as it is also corrosion resistant.


Pressure Treated Pine Decking
Pressure treated pine decking is another cost effective decking option for marine use. This classic wood decking option is often accompanied by matching fenders. Your dock can arrive with the decking already installed or undecked to allow dock utilities to be incorporated.




Ipe Hardwood Decking
This premium decking option is a durable and sustainable option. The natural hardwood is not treated yet requires little to no maintenance just like our aluminum docks.


Composite Decking
Composite deck planks can also be used on an aluminum floating dock. Match the dock fender to the decking for a designer look.




Grating
Gator offers composite and aluminum grating options, including ThruFlow decking. If your dock needs to meet environmental restrictions pertaining to sea grass and light penetration, this decking option may be right for your project.


Custom
Almost any decking style can be incorporated into a GatorDock. It is even possible to combine Gator's superior floatation options with a concrete deck to make a hybrid aluminum and concrete dock system. Pavers are another decking style available.




Synthetic Concrete
Concrete decking has its challenges especially when it comes to cracking and weight. Gator’s synthetic concrete deck solves these issues as well as provides a minimal maintenance, durable decking solution that looks like concrete. The fiberglass panels look like concrete and provide a slip resistant surface for our docks.







Fenders
Fenders are an attractive frame protection system that can be matched to the decking style for a clean, sophisticated look. Choose from pressure treated pine, Ipe hardwood, composite decking or UHMW strips for your floating dock fender.


Bumpers
Our HDPE bumpers wrap all the way around the exposed sides of the frame protecting boats from the aluminum dock frame and float. We offer two styles, a smaller 'P' bumper with corner pieces or a larger 'D' bumper that is mitered at the frame corners.




Cleats
Gator can incorporate any cleat style into the design of your dock system. We have a few of our own favorites including a 12 inch aluminum cleat that can be bolted or welded to the dock frame.


Utilities
Utility chases run the length of each of our floating docks and piers. These chases allow easy access and installation to water, electricity or other utility lines. Utility access panels can be designed into your boat dock as a custom feature.




Railing
We fabricate several rail styles at our manufacturing plant. Railing is often used to approach a dock float system or can be incorporated into the dock system itself. To learn about our available rail style, view our dock resources.


Other Accessories
Enhance your dock with gates, aluminum benches, roof systems, knee bracing or dock section connections. As a custom dock builder, we can fabricate any aluminum structure you can design.









Internal Pile Guides
GatorDock's standard internal pile guide is made from a frame and four UHMW plastic rollers. There are upgrade options and protective design features available when choosing to design your floating dock with internal pile guides.


External Pile Guides
There are two main options when choosing to anchor your floating dock with external pile guides. First, an enclosed, four roller external pile guide provides smooth movement during water fluctuations. Next, a structural D-ring hoop with a UHMW plastic roller can be attached to the side of the floating aluminum frame. Several customizations of these standard options may also be available.




Other Anchoring
Floating docks can be physically anchored to land through a strong arm style system or anchored to the water's floor through chain or a Seaflex style system. Talk with one of our floating dock experts to discuss these other anchoring options and determine the best solution for your aluminum dock needs.


TimberGuard Piles
TimberGuard® is made from lightly treated Southern Yellow Pine encased in a polymer plastic. This application does not adhere to the wood allowing the piling to expand and contract during temperature changes without compromising the integrity of the casing. This system has no harmful effects on the water or surrounding environment yet still can be constructed like you would with wood pilings and beams.




UltraComposite Piles
Our composite pilings, also known as FRP piles, can also be used to support your floating dock system. Our composite piles are better alternative than steel piles as they will not rust and do not require toxic paintings or coatings.

Gangways
Durable Aluminum Gangways
GatorDock offers two standard gangway options that are suitable for most marine applications – the DRI and DRII. As a custom gangway manufacturer, we often add design options and accessories to tailor the gangway to our client's needs. In commercial or extremely high traffic areas, such as national monuments, ferry loading, or theme parks, our staff will work with you to engineer a product that meets the loading and environmental specifications for your individual project. Our gangways, docks, and piers all start with the same rugged E-channel frames made from marine grade aluminum. Talk with a Gator project expert for hinge or connection options on your dock ramp.


DRII – Economic Gangway for Marine Use
For decades we have called our gangway the Dura-Ramp, shortened now to DR. The DRII gangway is designed for the most common access needs. Incorporating a removable 2-line rail, this workhorse gangway offers the best value for short to moderate spans. Made from the same heavy-duty marine grade aluminum as the rest of the GatorDock™ product line, our gangways are no exception to providing superior, long-lasting performance for your marine access needs. The DRII can be customized to meet ADA requirements, see the railing and decking options for choices.
 

DRI – Gator's Heavy Duty Gangway
The DRI aluminum gangway picks up where the DRII leaves off and is our heavy-duty standard gangway option. By incorporating a structural truss framework into the handrail, this highly efficient option can span great lengths. The GatorDock™ DRI incorporates all the requirements of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) into its economical design.


A Gangway is Not Always from Land to Sea

Gangway or Dock Ramp
The most typical use of a Gator Gangway is making the transition from land to dock. Talk with a project manager about integrating dock recesses into your gangway for a more functional and accessible transition.
 

Ship Access and Ferry Loading Ramps
From cruise ships to ferries, our gangways often act as passenger loading ramps to safely take boaters aboard. A custom aluminum gangway can be built to meet your loading and ADA criteria needs.
 

Aluminum Catwalks
Sometimes our gangways aren't found anywhere near the ocean. Our gangways designs make perfect catwalks for industrial and maintenance needs. Catwalk designs are often lighter duty using the DRII as a base design and incorporate grating as the decking.
 

Marine Terminals
For jobs requiring an even longer span than our heavy-duty custom gangways can provide, we design and fabricate aluminum bridges. Often used as marine terminals, these walkways can also incorporate lighting, gates, enclosures, and other features.

Gangway Options & Accessories
+ railing+ decking






ADA Rail
The most popular customization of our aluminum gangways is incorporating ADA compliant railing into the ramp.  The DRI has a toe rail and grab rail already incorporated into the design for accessibility. The DRII ramp can be customized with any of the ADA rail options.


Picket Rail
Known at Gator as the Giralt style rail, this rail can be merged with either the Dura-Ramp I or Dura-Ramp II designs.




Mesh Rail
This fencing style rail can be incorporated into our truss gangway designs.  A wood or aluminum ADA style hand rail can also be added with our mesh option.


Custom
Between our in house engineers and expert welders, any railing style can be achieved. Match current site railing aesthetics or bring us your design ideas to make your aluminum gangway truly custom.









Aluminum Slip-Resistant Decking
Our aluminum decking is textured in two planes for maximum slip resistance. It is a workhorse favorite among those who like the performance and look of aluminum, but don't want the hassle of ongoing maintenance. It is a perfect choice for structures near brackish or salt water. Because aluminum dissipates heat quickly, aluminum decking remains cooler than most surfaces.


Pressure Treated Pine
The look of a wooden dock is traditional. Add pressure treated pine decking to get an economical, classic look while the aluminum frame ensures longevity of your structure.




Composite Decking
Synthetic decking options are popular, low maintenance solutions to achieve a designer aesthetic. You can specify your composite decking brand and color for the decking of your Gator gangway.


Tropical Hardwood
Tropical hardwood provides heavy loading capacities and a long lasting designer look without chemical treatment. We choose Brazilian Ipe decking as our premium wood deck as it is a durable, low maintenance product for marine environments.




Grating
Gator's grating options include aluminum grating or composite grating (including ThruFlow). Choosing a grated surface as your dock ramp decking is a environmentally friendly option as it allows the sunlight to shine through the structure. Grating is also a popular choice for industrial and maintenance catwalks.
