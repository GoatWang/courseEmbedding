FAQ
 





Most Popular
 Featured




														How do I get started?						


 
How do I get started?
It’s really easy.
To get started, you just have to join UNATION, which takes about a minute. Right now we are letting people join through the iPhone App, Android App or unation.com.
 








														How do I create my first event?						


 
How do I create my first event?
Again, really easy. Just tap the + on the bottom menu of the mobile Apps, or the + on the left hand menu of the desktop version. From there, just start editing the fields you would like to include in your event. It’s all in line and very easy to navigate.
 








														So how do I add my ticket?						


 
So how do I add my ticket?
As you input content when you are creating an event, one of the options as you scroll is “Add Ticket.” Just tap that button and you will be directed to fill out your ticket information, like price, promo codes, etc. Really couldn’t get much easier.
One thing however, you will have to link your bank account the first time (one time only) you try and create a ticket with a dollar amount. This is so we can pay you. 🙂
 
 








														Do I need to charge sales tax for my event?						


 
Do I need to charge sales tax for my event?
Each State has different laws regarding how sales tax is collected. The best way for you to handle any taxes you may owe for your sales is by working directly with a tax advisor. UNATION cannot tell you if you need to charge tax or how much you need to charge if you do. If you’re not sure if you might be responsible for taxes on your sales, your State’s department of revenue website is a good place to start learning more.
 
 








														Linking my bank account scares me, is it secure?						


 
Linking my bank account scares me, is it secure?
Absolutely! UNATION has no access to your bank account, it is done through Stripe, which a secure payment processor. If you would like to learn more about Stripe, you can visit www.stripe.com 
So, to that point, you will have to set up an account with Stripe, which only takes a couple minutes. It’s free and easy as well. And as you earn money from your tickets, Stripe securely holds that money in your Stripe account and then releases funds to your Bank every Friday. 
No need to worry about setting up a Stripe account now, we will link you to the Stripe sign up form when the time comes in the set up process. 
 
 








														How much does UNATION cost?						


 
 How much does UNATION cost?
UNATION is free and always will be. You can download UNATION and use it to discover and create events at your leisure for no charge whatsoever. However, when you add a ticket to your event and charge your guests money, UNATION takes a small registration fee based on the price of your ticket. So basically, we only make money when you make money. For more information on fees, click here.
 








														I’m not a techie, is this difficult?						


 
I’m not a techie, is this difficult?
Not hard at all. In fact it is really easy and we pride ourselves on making this whole process as painless as possible for our users. If you can post on Facebook or write an email, you will have no problems understanding how to create an event and add a ticket on UNATION. The most advanced section is linking your Stripe account, but that too is pretty pain free. But if you would still like to see the exact steps — check out this link.
 








														How do I share my event on UNATION with my attendees?						


 
How do I share my event on UNATION with my attendees?
Again, really easy. If you create a public event then you will have a public URL that you can share. You can also invite people over email and share the event to all of your favorite social channels.
If it’s a private event, you will need to invite your guests over email and there will be a cookie attached to the link in their email that grants them permission to view the event, but they won’t have the ability to share.
As an added bonus, if you create a public event on UNATION and put that event into relevant categories, your event will be in front of all the UNATION users searching for things to do.
 








														Can people in other countries use UNATION to buy and sell tickets?						


 
Can people in other countries use UNATION to buy and sell tickets?
When a user on UNATION sets up their account to sell tickets for the first time, they will be asked to set up or link their Stripe account. Stripe is the payment portal linked to UNATION that processes all ticket transactions. Setting up or linking a Stripe account is a one time thing, simple to do, and can be done in less than 5 minutes. Stripe allows transactions in over 20 countries. To view the list of supported countries, you can click here.
If you have any other questions, you can email ticketsupport@unation.com
