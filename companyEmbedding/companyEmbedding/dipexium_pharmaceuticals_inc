(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose, any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate" or "continue" or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control.  Description of Business  Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company" or "Dipexium"), a Delaware corporation, formerly Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC, is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Locilex(R) (pexiganan cream 0.8%). The Company was formed on January 14, 2010. On October 25, 2016, the Company announced that its lead and sole product candidate, Locilex(R), failed to meet the primary clinical endpoint or secondary endpoints in its OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clinical trials. Dipexium's scientific team has evaluated the data from the OneStep clinical trials but has found no clear signal that Locilex(R) would be a strong product candidate for other possible clinical indications. Accordingly, Dipexium has explored strategic alternatives with its professional advisors and entered into a Merger Agreement with PLx Pharma Inc. ("PLx") on December 22, 2016 ("proposed merger"), pursuant to which PLx is expected to take control over Dipexium and Dipexium's stockholders are expected to maintain approximately 23.25% of the combined ownership upon completion of the merger, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. The Company or PLx may be required to pay a termination fee of $700,000 or $500,000, respectively, if the proposed merger is terminated under certain circumstances.  Plan of Operation  Under the proposed merger, the combined company will initially be focused on completion of manufacturing scale-up and label finalization for the previously conditionally approved AspertecTM 325 mg. aspirin dosage form thereby satisfying the open conditional items, and filing of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Aspertec 81 mg. maintenance dose form. Aspertec is being developed to provide high-risk cardiovascular and neurology patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric coated aspirin while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting.  Opportunities, Challenges and Risks  If the Proposed Merger is not consummated, our business and ability to execute our business strategy are subject to a number of risks and challenges including, without limitation, the following:  �We are heavily dependent on attaining regulatory approval for and, if approved, successfully commercializing Locilex(R). Locilex(R) is our only product candidate. As such, all of our resources and efforts have been and are expected for the foreseeable future to be dedicated to the development and commercialization of Locilex(R) which recently failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints in our OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 clinical trials. If our efforts fail to develop an appropriate regulatory strategy for Locilex, this will have a negative and substantial impact on the Company's viability unless we are able to develop or acquire other product candidates.  �The regulatory pathway for Locilex, if any, has yet to be identified. Review of the comprehensive data from the OneStep clinical trials is ongoing. The Company has no clear clinical or regulatory pathway forward for Locilex(R), the sole product of the Company, and no assurance can be given that an appropriate clinical and regulatory pathway exists. This process is inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to identify an appropriate regulatory pathway forward for Locilex(R), our business will be substantially harmed.  Table of Contents  �Manufacturing issues may prevent Locilex(R) from receiving regulatory approval. Although we believe that we have successfully resolved the manufacturing issues encountered by Locilex(R)'s prior sponsor and previously identified by the FDA, to the extent that such issues are not resolved or to the extent new issues arise, regulatory approval for Locilex(R) may be delayed or withheld, and we may not be able to meet the developmental milestones necessary to continue our business.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Summary Table The following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, Percentage 2017 2016 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Research and Development Expenses $ 15 $ 3,584 (99 )% Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 1,552 $ 2,247 (31 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 1,567 $ 5,831 (73 )% Interest Income $ 37 $ 14 164 % Net Loss $ 1,530 $ 5,817 (74 )%  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses were $0.02 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million. The decrease was due to the completion of the clinical trials in 2016 and the reduction of all clinical trial related expenses.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.6 million. This was due primarily to a decrease of $1.0 million in compensation related expenses due to the fewer employees as a result of the failure of the OneStep Phase 3 clincial trials, offset by increased legal and professional fees due to the proposed merger.  Net Loss  Net loss was $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $4.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, due to the reasons stated above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  We have generated no revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately $63.9 million since inception. We have funded our operations primarily from equity issuances. On March 18, 2014, we closed an initial public offering of 3,162,500 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share. Gross proceeds raised by us in the offering were approximately $38.0 million, and net proceeds to us were approximately $34.5 million.  Table of Contents  On June 30, 2015, we completed a stock offering issuing 1,702,000 shares of common stock at a price of $12.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $21.3 million and net proceeds of $19.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts of $1.3 million and offering costs of approximately $0.3 million.  The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company has needed to raise capital from sales of its securities to sustain operations. In March 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock with proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $34.5 million. In June 2015, the Company completed an additional public offering of common stock with net proceeds of approximately $19.7 million. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and short-term notes receivable totaling approximately $14.4 million. Assuming the merger is completed during the first half of 2017, Dipexium expects its cash as of March 31, 2017 to meet its liquidity requirements through at least its anticipated close of the merger, including the closing condition under the Merger Agreement to have at least $12.0 million of "cash," as defined in the Merger Agreement, available upon the closing of the merger. If the merger is not completed, Dipexium will need to reevaluate its strategic alternatives, which may include continuing to operate its business as an independent, stand-alone company, a sale of the Company, liquidation of the Company or other strategic transaction. Dipexium's liquidity position will be dependent upon the strategic alternative selected; however, assuming Dipexium does not enter into another strategic transaction, Dipexium expects its cash as of March 31, 2017 will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements through at least April 30, 2018. Additional financing would be required should Dipexium decide to commence a new clinical program for Locilex(R) in a new clinical indication. Cash needs to pursue a new clinical indication cannot even be estimated until a promising new indication for Locilex(R) to target is identified, if ever.  As of March 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $12.0 million, consisting primarily of $12.4 million of cash, offset by $0.5 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Table of Contents  The following tables sets forth selected cash flow information for the periods indicated:   For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (2,261 ) $ (5,075 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (2,000 ) 4,010 Net decrease in cash $ (4,261 ) $ (1,065 )  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for this period was less than the net cash used in operating activities by $0.8 million, which was primarily attributable to $0.7 million of share-based compensation, a $0.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Net cash used in operating activities was $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The net loss for this period was greater than the net cash used in operating activities by $0.7 million, which was primarily attributable to $1.5 million of share-based compensation offset by a $0.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2.0 million, which was attributable to the Company's purchase of a note receivable from advance to PLx.  Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $4.0 million, which was attributable to the Company's net investments and maturities of United States Treasury Bills.  Contractual Obligations  In January 2016, the Company entered into a lease for office space commencing in March 2016. The term of the lease is for five years and five months with total minimum lease payments of approximately $1.28 million.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, in an effort to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill and the associated procedures to determine fair value. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, in an effort to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, in an effort to reduce the diversity of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, in an effort to simplify accounting for certain aspects of income tax accounting and accounting for forfeitures. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  Table of Contents  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which includes amendments that require lessees to recognize a lease liability for all long-term leases (lease terms more than 12 months) at the commencement date. The lease liability is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. The amendments also require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset for all long-term leases. The right-of-use asset is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this ASU require qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which requires that all deferred income tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early application permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern, which requires management of an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. This update is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an "emerging growth company," we may, under  Share-Based Compensation  We account for the cost of services performed by employees and directors received in exchange for common stock, or stock options, based upon the grant date fair value of the award. In accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, we recognize compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  We account for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of membership interests or common stock based upon the grant date fair value of the award or fair value of the services rendered, whichever is more readily determinable. In accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, we recognize the expense in the same period and in the same manner as if we had paid cash for the services.  Table of Contents  Research and Development Expenses  Although we manage the conduct of our own clinical trials, we rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and to provide services, including data management, statistical analysis and electronic compilation for our clinical trials, as well as for the manufacture of our clinical trial supplies. At the end of each reporting period, we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress towards completion of the related project. Factors that are considered in preparing these estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies, milestones achieved and other criteria related to the efforts of our vendors. These estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Depending on the timing of payments to vendors and estimated services provided, we record net prepaid or accrued expenses related to these costs.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have, during the periods presented, and we are currently not party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Seasonality  We do not have a seasonal business cycle. Our operating results are generally derived evenly throughout the calendar year.  Apr 17, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

NEW YORK and HOUSTON, Dec. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DPRX) and PLx Pharma Inc. (PLx Pharma), a privately held late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which PLx Pharma will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dipexium in an all-stock transaction.  Following closing, Dipexium will be renamed PLx Pharma Inc., and will operate under the leadership of the PLx management team with Michael Valentino serving as Executive Chairman of the company's Board of Directors and Natasha Giordano serving as President and Chief Executive Officer.  








The combined company will initially be focused on completion of manufacturing scale-up and label finalization for the previously conditionally approved AspertecTM 325 mg aspirin dosage form thereby satisfying the open conditional items, and filing of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Aspertec 81 mg maintenance dose form.  Aspertec is being developed to provide high-risk cardiovascular and neurology patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric coated aspirin while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting.  
Natasha Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer of PLx Pharma, said, "This merger will provide PLx Pharma with the initial resources necessary to advance our contemplated development efforts for Aspertec and begin the critical pre-commercialization activities necessary to prepare the market for this important cardiovascular product."
PLx stockholders will receive newly issued shares of common stock of Dipexium in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement.  Dipexium will issue approximately 36 million new shares of its common stock to PLx stockholders under the exchange ratio formula defined in the merger agreement.  Upon the closing of the merger, existing PLx stockholders are expected to own 76.75% of Dipexium common shares outstanding and existing Dipexium stockholders are expected to own 23.25% of Dipexium common shares outstanding.  The exchange ratio is defined in the merger agreement and is subject to potential adjustment.
"This transaction with PLx Pharma reflects the continued commitment of Dipexium's Board of Directors and management team to deliver value to Dipexium stockholders," said David Luci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dipexium.  "The merger brings with it the PLx Pharma management team, comprised of highly accomplished and seasoned executives who have launched and successfully commercialized many market leading over-the-counter products, among them Mike Valentino as Executive Chairman of PLx Pharma, who previously launched multiple major Rx-to-OTC switches including Benadryl, Motrin Jr., Rogaine Extra Strength, Lamisil, Nasalcrom, Voltaren,  and most recently, as CEO of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., Mucinex®."
The boards of directors of both Dipexium and PLx Pharma have unanimously approved the proposed transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of each of Dipexium and PLx Pharma.  The merger is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.
Raymond James & Associates is acting as financial advisor to Dipexium and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. is serving as its legal counsel. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC is acting as financial advisor to PLx and Jackson Walker LLP is acting as its legal counsel.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Dipexium Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PLXP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

(DPRX) and PLx Pharma Inc. (PLx Pharma), a privately held late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which PLx Pharma will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dipexium in an all-stock transaction.  Following closing, Dipexium will be renamed PLx Pharma Inc., and will operate under the leadership of the PLx management team with Michael Valentino serving as Executive Chairman of the company's Board of Directors and Natasha Giordano serving as President and Chief Executive Officer. The combined company will initially be focused on completion of manufacturing scale-up and label finalization for the previously conditionally approved AspertecTM 325 mg aspirin dosage form thereby satisfying the open conditional items, and filing of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Aspertec 81 mg maintenance dose form.  Aspertec is being developed to provide high-risk cardiovascular and neurology patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric coated aspirin while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting. Natasha Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer of PLx Pharma, said, "This merger will provide PLx Pharma with the initial resources necessary to advance our contemplated development efforts for Aspertec and begin the critical pre-commercialization activities necessary to prepare the market for this important cardiovascular product."PLx stockholders will receive newly issued shares of common stock of Dipexium in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement.  Dipexium will issue approximately 36 million new shares of its common stock to PLx stockholders under the exchange ratio formula defined in the merger agreement.  Upon the closing of the merger, existing PLx stockholders are expected to own 76.75% of Dipexium common shares outstanding and existing Dipexium stockholders are expected to own 23.25% of Dipexium common shares outstanding.  The exchange ratio is defined in the merger agreement and is subject to potential adjustment."This transaction with PLx Pharma reflects the continued commitment of Dipexium's Board of Directors and management team to deliver value to Dipexium stockholders," said David Luci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dipexium.  "The merger brings with it the PLx Pharma management team, comprised of highly accomplished and seasoned executives who have launched and successfully commercialized many market leading over-the-counter products, among them Mike Valentino as Executive Chairman of PLx Pharma, who previously launched multiple major Rx-to-OTC switches including Benadryl, Motrin Jr., Rogaine Extra Strength, Lamisil, Nasalcrom, Voltaren,  and most recently, as CEO of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., Mucinex®."The boards of directors of both Dipexium and PLx Pharma have unanimously approved the proposed transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of each of Dipexium and PLx Pharma.  The merger is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Raymond James & Associates is acting as financial advisor to Dipexium and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. is serving as its legal counsel.

(DPRX), a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Locilex® (pexiganan cream 0.8%), a novel, broad-spectrum, topical antibiotic peptide, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. "In the second quarter we completed enrollment in the OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of Locilex in patients with mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers (Mild DFI) and expect to have top-line data in September. Pending the results of these trials, we anticipate submitting a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2017," said David P. Luci, President and CEO of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals. "Based on our market research, there is a significant unmet medical need for a non-invasive, topical treatment for Mild DFI with the target product profile of Locilex. If approved, Locilex, has the potential to be the first product specifically approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with Mild DFI."Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2016For the three months ended June 30, 2016, Dipexium reported a net loss of $5.4 million, compared to a net loss of $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $1.4 million.  The change was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in Phase 3 clinical trial enrollment and related clinical trial expenses, and $0.5 million of increased manufacturing expenses relating to validation batches.For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Dipexium reported a net loss of $11.2 million, compared to a net loss of $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $3.0 million. This change was primarily due to a $3.3 million increase in research and development expenses partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The increase in research and development expenses were due to $2.7 million of increased Phase 3 trial enrollment and related clinical trial expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in manufacturing expenses relating to validation batches. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease of $0.2 million for stock-based compensation expenses and a $0.1 million decrease in professional fees.Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $9.7 million versus $6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.   The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to increased research and development expenses associated with increased Phase 3 trial enrollment and related clinical trial expenses.   At June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $22.6 million, compared to $32.2 million at December 31, 2015. The Company's cash balance is currently anticipated to fund operations through 2017.Conference Call & Webcast InformationDipexium will host a conference call today beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, during which management will discuss Dipexium's financial results and recent developments.
