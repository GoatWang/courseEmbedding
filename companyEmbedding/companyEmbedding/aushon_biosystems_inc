Cira™ Immunoassay Platform Overview




The Cira immunoassay platform revolutionizes protein biomarker research — combining ELISA’s sensitivity and reproducibility with all the advantages of multiplexing. Only Cira™ delivers on the promise of multiplexing’s throughput and affordability without compromising the sensitivity and consistency of singleplex ELISA.
The Cira™ immunoassay platform consists of the following products and services: 

Ciraplex® ULTRA Ultrasensitive assay kits will enable researchers and clinicians to measure analytes at previously undetectable levels without giving up the precision and ease of use of our Cira™ platform.  With total assay time of under three hours and the ability to read an entire 96-well plate in under five minutes, these assays are suitable for use in Iarge clinical studies. In addition, these assays have a quantitative range of up to 4.5 logs, enabling researchers to simultaneously measure both the high and low regions of the range for a single analyte.
Ciraplex® assays utilize up to 12 analytes per well  printed in a patent-pending circular pattern. This revolutionary assay technology provides consistent incubation with low sample volume, enabling exceptional reproducibility. A  large menu of validated analytes across 7 species.
Cirascan™ immunoassay system combines astronomy-grade optics with sophisticated Cirasoft™ software to enhance signal-to-noise ratios for dramatically improved sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility.
Cirareports™ software quickly analyzes and summarizes data from multi-plate studies for instant viewing in your chosen format.
                  Cira™ services sample testing service utilizes our Ciraplex® immunoassays for sample processing in our CLIA-certified laboratory. Choose from our current menu of multiple validated biomarker assays.  Custom assay development and validation services are also available.
                  
2470 Arrayer is the precision printing technology that enables Cira sensitivity, dynamic range,  and reproducibility.  The 2470 can produce high-quality arrays of DNA, proteins, cell lysates and other sample types using Aushon’s proprietary soft-touch deposition technology. The 2470 arrayer deposits complex biological samples onto a broad range of substrates such as slides, membranes, microtiter plate wells, disks, wafers and chips.

Introducing Ciraplex® ULTRA Ultrasensitive Assays Combining the Power of Multiplexing with Ultrasensitivity
Ciraplex® ULTRA Ultrasensitive Assays with femtogram/ml (fg/ml) levels of detection address multiple biomarkers in a wide range of therapeutic areas. These kits offer enhanced sensitivity and an extended dynamic range providing quantification below standard detection limits. As well, intuitive Cira™ software streamlines the data management process providing exceptional data control.
The Cira™ immunoassay platform was specifically designed by a team of Aushon engineers and biologists to offer accurate multiplex biomarker analysis with simplicity and savings in mind. The Cira™ platform combines the accuracy and precision of ELISA, the sensitivity of chemiluminescence, and the throughput and affordability of multiplexing. The circular Ciraplex® format (patent-pending) offers enhanced accuracy and precision versus traditional protein array configurations. The Aushon menu features key biomarkers in a wide range of therapeutic areas being used to enhance knowledge and improve decision-making in translational medicine.

Aushon BioSystems Announces the Launch of the Ciraplex ULTRA Ultrasensitive Human 3-Plex IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10 Multiplexed Assay
May 2 17
Aushon BioSystems announced the launch of the Ciraplex ULTRA Ultrasensitive Human 3-Plex IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-10 Multiplexed Assay. The new Aushon Ciraplex ULTRA Ultrasensitive Human 3-Plex IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-10 Multiplexed Assay is a plate based protein array with ability to obtain low levels of detection for up to 3 biomarkers in one assay. The new product advancement allows clinician’s with precious samples to measure biomarkers simultaneously, rather than sequentially, thus optimizing sample consumption. The ultrasensitivity is measured at single-digit femtogram/ml (fg/ml) levels which are unmatched by other standard protein immunoassay methods. In conjunction with the launch of the Ciraplex ULTRA Ultrasensitive 3-Plex Assay, Andrew Nixon, PhD., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Duke Phase I Biomarker Laboratory, Molecular Reference Lab, Duke University will present data at the Biomarkers and Immuno-Oncology World Congress in Philadelphia on May 3, 2017 at 8:25 AM. Dr. Nixon will show technical data and patient data from samples run on the new Aushon Ciraplex Human Cytokine 10-plex Array and Ciraplex ULTRA Ultrasensitive 3-plex kit demonstrating the use of ultrasensitive multiplex protein arrays in immuno-oncology biomarker development.
