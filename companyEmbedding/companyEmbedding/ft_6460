<FN>                                                                                                
(1) As of the Evaluation Time on the Initial Date of Deposit, we may adjust                         
the number of Units of the Trust so that the Public Offering Price per Unit                         
will equal approximately $10.00. If we make such an adjustment, the fractional                      
undivided interest per Unit will vary from the amount indicated above.                              

(2) The Public Offering Price shown above reflects the value of the Securities                      
on the business day prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. No investor will                          
purchase Units at this price. The price you pay for your Units will be based                        
on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units.                      
On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Public Offering Price per Unit will not                         
include any accumulated dividends on the Securities. After this date, a pro                         
rata share of any accumulated dividends on the Securities will be included.                         

(3) You will pay a maximum sales charge of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price                       
per Unit (equivalent to 3.95% of the net amount invested) which consists of a                       
deferred sales charge and a creation and development fee. The sales charges                         
are described in the "Fee Table."                                                                   

(4) Each listed Security is valued at its last closing sale price at the                            
Evaluation Time on the business day prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. If a                      
Security is not listed, or if no closing sale price exists, it is valued at                         
its closing ask price on such date. See "Public Offering-The Value of the                           
Securities." Evaluations for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or                          
redemption price of Units are made as of the close of trading on the New York                       
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day on                           
which it is open (the "Evaluation Time").                                                           

(5) The creation and development fee will be deducted from the assets of the                        
Trust at the end of the initial offering period and the estimated organization                      
costs per Unit will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of                      
six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial                              
offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to any such reduction, these fees                      
will not be deducted from the redemption proceeds. See "Redeeming Your Units."                      

(6) The estimated net annual distribution per Unit for subsequent years, $   ,                      
is expected to be less than that set forth above for the first year because a                       
portion of the Securities included in the Trust will be sold during the first                       
year to pay for organization costs, the deferred sales charge and the creation                      
and development fee. We base our estimate of the dividends the Trust will                           
receive from the Securities by annualizing the most recent dividends declared                       
by the issuers of the Securities (such figure adjusted to reflect any change                        
in dividend policy announced subsequent to the most recently declared                               
dividend). There is no guarantee that the issuers of the Securities will                            
receive consistent distributions from the underlying securities in which they                       
invest and, therefore, that they will declare dividends in the future or that,                      
if declared, they will either remain at current levels or increase over time.                       
Due to this, and various other factors, actual dividends received from the                          
Securities may be less than their most recent annualized dividends. In this                         
case, the actual net annual distribution you receive will be less than the                          
estimated amount set forth above. The actual net annual distribution per Unit                       
you receive will also vary from that set forth above with changes in the                            
Trust's fees and expenses and with the sale of Securities. See "Fee Table,"
"Risk Factors" and "Expenses and Charges." The Trustee will distribute money                        
from the Capital Account monthly on the twenty-fifth day of each month to Unit                      
holders of record on the tenth day of each month if the amount available for                        
distribution equals at least $1.00 per 100 Units. In any case, the Trustee                          
will distribute any funds in the Capital Account in December of each year and                       
as part of the final liquidation distribution. See "Income and Capital
Distributions."

Fee Table (Unaudited) 

This Fee Table describes the fees and expenses that you may, directly or        
indirectly, pay if you buy and hold Units of the Trust. See "Public Offering"   
and "Expenses and Charges." Although the Trust has a term of approximately two  
years and is a unit investment trust rather than a mutual fund, this            
information allows you to compare fees.

                                    Example                                                       

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the                         
Trust with the cost of investing in other investment products. The example                        
assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Trust for the periods shown. The                           
example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year and that the                        
Trust's operating expenses stay the same. The example does not take into                          
consideration transaction fees which may be charged by certain broker/dealers                     
for processing redemption requests. Although your actual costs may vary, based                    
on these assumptions your costs, assuming you sell or redeem your Units at the                    
end of each period, would be:                                                                     

                       1 Year             2 Years                                                 
                       ______             _______

The example will not differ if you hold rather than sell your Units at the end                    
of each period.                                                                                   
_____________                                                                                     
<FN>                                                                                              
(a) The maximum sales charge during the initial offering period consists of a                     
deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee. There is no                           
initial sales charge during the initial offering period. Both the deferred                        
sales charge and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per                    
Unit. Because of this, the maximum sales charge, as a percentage of the Public                    
Offering Price, will vary with changes in the Public Offering Price. At a                         
Public Offering Price of $10 per Unit, the maximum sales charge will be 3.95%                     
of the Public Offering Price per Unit. If the price you pay for your Units                        
exceeds $10 per Unit, the maximum sales charge will be less than 3.95%. If the                    
price you pay for your Units is less than $10 per Unit, the maximum sales                         
charge will exceed 3.95%, but in no event will the maximum sales charge exceed                    
4.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.                                                      

(b) The deferred sales charge is a fixed dollar amount equal to $.345 per                         
Unit which, as a percentage of the Public Offering Price, will vary over time.                    
At a Public Offering Price of $10 per Unit, the deferred sales charge will be                     
3.45% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. If the price you pay for your                        
Units exceeds $10 per Unit, the deferred sales charge will be less than 3.45%.                    
If the price you pay for your Units is less than $10 per Unit, the deferred                       
sales charge will exceed 3.45%, but in no event will the deferred sales charge                    
exceed 4.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. The deferred sales charge                     
will be deducted in three monthly installments of $.115 per Unit commencing                       
January 20, 2017 through March 20, 2017.                                                          

(c) The creation and development fee compensates the Sponsor for creating and                     
developing the Trust. The creation and development fee is a charge of $.050                       
per Unit collected at the end of the initial offering period, which is                            
expected to be approximately one month from the Initial Date of Deposit. If                       
the price you pay for your Units exceeds $10 per Unit, the creation and                           
development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay for your Units                      
is less than $10 per Unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%.                    

(d) Estimated organization costs will be deducted from the assets of the                          
Trust at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the                       
end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization costs are assessed                     
on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net                     
assets, will vary over time.                                                                      

(e) With the exception of the underlying Fund expenses, each of the fees listed                   
herein is assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a                            
percentage of average net assets, will vary over time.                                            

(f) Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other portfolio                   
transaction fees for the Trust. In certain circumstances the Trust may incur                      
additional expenses not set forth above. See "Expenses and Charges."                              

(g) Although not an actual Trust operating expense, the Trust, and therefore                      
Unit holders, will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the Funds in                     
which the Trust invests in the estimated amounts set forth in the table. These                    
expenses are estimated based on the actual Fund expenses disclosed in a Fund's                    
most recent SEC filing but are subject to change in the future. An investor in                    
the Trust will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying                    
Fund shares were held directly.

 NOTES TO STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS 

The Trust is registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment                
Company Act of 1940. The Sponsor is responsible for the preparation of                 
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally                
accepted in the United States which require the Sponsor to make estimates and          
assumptions that affect amounts reported herein. Actual results could differ           
from those estimates. The Trust intends to comply in its initial fiscal year           
and thereafter with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to              
regulated investment companies and as such, will not be subject to federal             
income taxes on otherwise taxable income (including net realized capital               
gains) distributed to Unit holders.                                                    

(1) The Trust invests in a portfolio of Closed-End Funds. Aggregate cost of            
the Securities listed under "Schedule of Investments" is based on their                
aggregate underlying value. The Trust has a Mandatory Termination Date of              
January 29, 2019.                                                                      

(2) An irrevocable letter of credit issued by The Bank of New York Mellon, of          
which approximately $200,000 has been allocated to the Trust, has been                 
deposited with the Trustee as collateral, covering the monies necessary for            
the purchase of the Securities according to their purchase contracts.                  

(3) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to         
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the            
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.0320 per Unit. A payment will be           
made at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end         
of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the Trustee from            
which the obligation of the investors to the Sponsor will be satisfied. To the         
extent that actual organization costs of the Trust are greater than the                
estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the Public            
Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets          
of the Trust.                                                                          

(4) Represents the amount of mandatory deferred sales charge distributions of          
$.345 per Unit, payable to the Sponsor in three equal monthly installments of          
$.115 per Unit beginning on January 20, 2017 and on the twentieth day of each          
month thereafter (or if such date is not a business day, on the preceding              
business day) through March 20, 2017. If Unit holders redeem Units before              
March 20, 2017, they will have to pay the remaining amount of the deferred             
sales charge applicable to such Units when they redeem them.                           

(5) The creation and development fee ($.050 per Unit) is payable by the Trust          
on behalf of Unit holders out of assets of the Trust at the end of the initial         
offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the initial               
offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the proceeds.                       

(6) Net asset value per Unit is calculated by dividing the Trust's net assets          
by the number of Units outstanding. This figure includes organization costs            
and the creation and development fee, which will only be assessed to Units             
outstanding at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or          
the end of the initial offering period in the case of organization costs or            
the close of the initial offering period in the case of the creation and               
development fee.                                                                       

(7) The aggregate cost to investors in the Trust includes a maximum sales              
charge (comprised of a deferred sales charge and the creation and development          
fee) computed at the rate of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit               
(equivalent to 3.95% of the net amount invested, exclusive of the deferred             
sales charge and the creation and development fee), assuming no reduction of           
the maximum sales charge as set forth under "Public Offering." Both the                
deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar            
amounts per Unit. Because of this, the maximum sales charge, as a percentage           
of the Public Offering Price, will vary with changes in the Public Offering            
Price. At a Public Offering Price of $10 per Unit, the maximum sales charge            
will be 3.95%. In no event will the maximum sales charge exceed 4.50% of the           
Public Offering Price per Unit.

The FT Series Defined.                                                          

We, First Trust Portfolios L.P. (the "Sponsor"), have created hundreds of       
similar yet separate series of a unit investment trust which we have named the  
FT Series. The series to which this prospectus relates, FT 6460, consists of a  
single portfolio known as January Effect Plus Portfolio, Series 6.              

The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York by a Trust        
Agreement (the "Indenture") dated the Initial Date of Deposit. This agreement,  
entered into among First Trust Portfolios L.P., as Sponsor, The Bank of New     
York Mellon as Trustee and First Trust Advisors L.P. as Portfolio Supervisor    
and Evaluator, governs the operation of the Trust.                              

YOU MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS CONCERNING THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND RISKS    
OF THIS PRODUCT IN AN "INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT" BY CALLING THE SPONSOR AT 800-   
621-1675, DEPT. CODE 2.                                                         

How We Created the Trust.                                                       

On the Initial Date of Deposit, we deposited a portfolio of Closed-End Funds    
with the Trustee and, in turn, the Trustee delivered documents to us            
representing our ownership of the Trust, in the form of units ("Units").        

After the Initial Date of Deposit, we may deposit additional Securities in the  
Trust, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with            
instructions to buy more Securities, in order to create new Units for sale. If  
we create additional Units, we will attempt, to the extent practicable, to      
maintain the percentage relationship established among the Securities on the    
Initial Date of Deposit (as set forth in "Schedule of Investments"), adjusted   
to reflect the sale, redemption or liquidation of any of the Securities or any  
stock split or a merger or other similar event affecting the issuer of the      
Securities.                                                                     

Since the prices of the Securities will fluctuate daily, the ratio of           
Securities in the Trust, on a market value basis, will also change daily. The   
portion of Securities represented by each Unit will not change as a result of   
the deposit of additional Securities or cash in the Trust. If we deposit cash,  
you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment. This is     
because prices of Securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash        
deposit and the purchase of the Securities, and because the Trust pays the      
associated brokerage fees. To reduce this dilution, the Trust will try to buy   
the Securities as close to the Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation   
price as possible. In addition, because the Trust pays the brokerage fees       
associated with the creation of new Units and with the sale of Securities to    
meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange         
activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses.                       

An affiliate of the Trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the Trustee     
may retain and pay us (or our affiliate) to act as agent for the Trust to buy   
Securities. If we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the Trust, we will    
be subject to the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as     
amended (the "1940 Act"). When acting in an agency capacity, we may select      
various broker/dealers to execute securities transactions on behalf of the      
Trust, which may include broker/dealers who sell Units of the Trust. We do not  
consider sales of Units of the Trust or any other products sponsored by First   
Trust as a factor in selecting such broker/dealers.                             

We cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size and composition   
for any length of time. Securities may be periodically sold under certain       
circumstances to satisfy Trust obligations, to meet redemption requests and,    
as described in "Removing Securities from the Trust," to maintain the sound     
investment character of the Trust, and the proceeds received by the Trust will  
be used to meet Trust obligations or distributed to Unit holders, but will not  
be reinvested. However, Securities will not be sold to take advantage of        
market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or          
depreciation, or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were         
selected. You will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the Securities in   
the Trust. As the holder of the Securities, the Trustee will vote the           
Securities and, except as described in "Removing Securities from the Trust,"    
will endeavor to vote the Securities such that the Securities are voted as      
closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are   
the Securities held by owners other than such Trust.                            

Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the           
Securities. However, if a contract for the purchase of any of the Securities    
initially deposited in the Trust fails, unless we can purchase substitute       
Securities ("Replacement Securities") we will refund to you that portion of     
the purchase price and transactional sales charge resulting from the failed     
contract on the next Income Distribution Date. Any Replacement Security the     
Trust acquires will be identical to those from the failed contract.             

Page 9                                                                          

Portfolio                   

Objectives.                                                                     

The Trust seeks current income, with total return as a secondary objective.     

An important part of many investors' overall strategy is to minimize taxes. As  
the end of the year approaches, investors with securities in taxable accounts   
typically review their portfolio for potential tax losses. Historically, when   
tax-motivated selling pressures occur in December, closed-end fund ("CEF")      
discounts can widen further.                                                    

Portfolio Selection Criteria.                                                   

The Trust is a unit investment trust which invests in CEFs that we believe may  
benefit once tax-motivated selling pressures abate after the end of the year.   
The Trust invests in taxable CEFs which meet the following criteria:            

- Price Decline - Price decline of 10% or greater from each CEF's 2016 high at  
the time the portfolio is selected.                                             

- Discount to NAV -We select funds which are trading at a discount to net       
asset value and we favor those which are trading at a greater discount          
relative to their peers.                                                        

- Liquidity - A fund's overall size must be considered, as well as its average  
trading volume. We favor larger funds and funds with higher trading volume.     

- Dividend Yield -We look for funds with higher dividend yields relative to     
comparable funds, as well as those that have shown a relatively stable payment  
level over time.                                                                

- Diversification - In order to cover the broadest scope of the market, we      
diversify among fund companies and categories. Diversification does not         
guarantee a profit or protect against loss.                                     

Closed-End Fund Selection.                                                      

The Closed-End Funds were selected by our research department based on a        
number of factors including, but not limited to, the size and liquidity of the  
Closed-End Fund, the current dividend yield of the Closed-End Fund, the         
quality and character of the securities held by the Closed-End Fund, and the    
expense ratio of the Closed-End Fund, while attempting to limit the overlap of  
the securities held by the Closed-End Funds.                                    

You should be aware that predictions stated herein may not be realized. Of      
course, as with any similar investment, there can be no guarantee that the      
objectives of the Trust will be achieved. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion   
of the risks of investing in the Trust.                                         

Risk Factors                    

Principal Risks.                                                                

The following is a discussion of the principal risks of investing in the Trust. 

Price Volatility. The Trust invests in Closed-End Funds. The value of the       
Trust's Units will fluctuate with changes in the value of these Securities.     
The value of a security fluctuates for several reasons including changes in     
investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general   
condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or when      
political or economic events affecting the issuers occur.                       

Because the Trust is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities in       
response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common in managed  
investments. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance   
of the Trust will be positive over any period of time or that you won't lose    
money. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or   
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other            
government agency.                                                              

Current Economic Conditions. The global economy continues to experience         
subdued growth. Most developed and developing economies are continuing to       
struggle against the lingering effects of the financial crisis which began in   
2007, grappling in particular with the challenges of taking appropriate fiscal  
and monetary policy actions. Inflation remains tame worldwide, partly           
reflecting output gaps, high unemployment and a continued financial             
deleveraging in major developed economies. The global employment situation      
remains challenging, as long-lasting effects from the financial crisis          
continue to weigh on labor markets in many countries and regions. Prices of     
most primary commodities, a driving force behind many emerging market           
economies, have declined moderately in recent years, mainly driven by           
generally weak global demand as global economic growth remains anemic.          

The financial crisis began with problems in the U.S. housing and credit         
markets, many of which were caused by defaults on "subprime" mortgages and      
mortgage-backed securities, eventually leading to the failures of some large    
financial institutions and has negatively impacted most sectors of the global   
economy. Recently, falling oil and other commodity prices, subdued growth in    
China and other emerging markets and uncertain economic forecasts for the       
United States and a number of developed countries have contributed to           

Page 10                                                                         

significant market volatility worldwide. The United Kingdom vote to leave the   
European Union ("Brexit") and other recent rapid political and social change    
throughout Europe make the extent and nature of future economic development in  
Europe and the effect on securities issued by European issuers difficult to     
predict. The election of a Republican president and a Republican-controlled     
Congress could result in significant changes to government policies,            
regulatory environments and other conditions, which are difficult to predict    
and could negatively impact certain of the issuers of the Securities held by    
the Trust. Due to the current state of uncertainty in the economy, the value    
of the Securities held by the Trust may be subject to steep declines or         
increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the         
issuers. To combat the financial crisis, central banks in the United States,    
Europe and Asia have held interest rates at historically low levels for         
several years. However, there is no assurance that this will continue in the    
future and no way to predict how quickly interest rates will rise once central  
banks change their current position. In addition, other extraordinary steps     
have been taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to     
combat the financial crisis; however, the impact of these measures has been     
mixed and in certain instances has produced unintended consequences.            

Distributions. As stated under "Summary of Essential Information," the Trust    
will generally make monthly distributions of income. The Funds held by the      
Trust make distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis. As a result of        
changing interest rates, refundings, sales or defaults on the underlying        
securities held by the Funds, and other factors, there is no guarantee that     
distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time.       

Closed-End Funds. The Trust invests in shares of Closed-End Funds. Closed-end   
funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in various types   
of securities. Closed-end funds issue shares of common stock that are traded    
on a securities exchange. Closed-end funds are subject to various risks,        
including management's ability to meet the closed-end fund's investment         
objective, and to manage the closed-end fund portfolio when the underlying      
securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil and as        
investors' perceptions regarding closed-end funds or their underlying           
investments change.                                                             

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset  
value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the      
risk that the net asset value of closed-end fund shares may decrease. The       
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to  
time in response to various factors.                                            

Investment in Other Investment Companies Risk. Because the Trust holds Funds,   
Unit holders are subject to the risk that the securities selected by the        
Funds' investment advisors will underperform the markets, the relevant indices  
or the securities selected by other funds. Further, Funds may in the future     
invest in other types of securities which involve risk which may differ from    
those set forth below. In addition, because the Trust holds Funds, Unit         
holders bear both their proportionate share of the expenses of the Trust and,   
indirectly the expenses of the Funds. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust    
may invest a relatively high percentage of their assets in a limited number of  
issuers. As a result, these Funds may be more susceptible to a single adverse   
economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers,       
experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.  

Common Stocks. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in common stocks.  
Common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a company. Common  
stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors'      
perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition    
of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or when political or   
economic events affecting the issuers occur. Common stock prices may also be    
particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises   
and borrowing costs increase.                                                   

Convertible Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in        
convertible securities. Convertible securities are bonds, preferred stocks,     
and other securities that pay interest or dividends and are convertible into    
common stocks. As such, convertible securities have some characteristics of     
both bonds and common stocks. Like a bond (or some preferred stocks), a         
convertible security typically pays a fixed rate of interest (or dividends)     
and promises to repay principal at a given date in the future. However, an      
investor can exchange the convertible security for a specific number of shares  
of the issuing company's common stock at a "conversion price" specified at the  
time the convertible security is issued. Companies that issue convertible       
securities often do not have high credit ratings. In addition, the credit       
rating of a company's convertible securities is typically lower than the        
rating of the company's conventional debt securities, because convertibles are  
normally considered junior or subordinate securities. Convertible securities    
are predominantly high-yield securities. Convertible securities are typically   

Page 11                                                                         

issued at prices which represent a premium to their conversion value.           
Accordingly, the value of the convertible security increases (or decreases) as  
the price of the underlying common stock increases (or decreases). Convertible  
securities typically pay income yields that are higher than the dividend        
yields of the issuer's common stock, but lower than the yields of the issuer's  
debt securities.                                                                

In general, a convertible security performs more like a stock when the          
underlying common stock's price is closer to the conversion price of the        
convertible security (because it is assumed that it will be converted into the  
stock) and more like a bond when the underlying common stock's price is         
significantly lower than the convertible security's conversion price (because   
it is assumed that it will not be converted). For these reasons Unit holders    
must be willing to accept the market risks of both bonds and common stocks.     
However, because convertible securities have characteristics of both common     
stocks and bonds, they tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than  
bonds of comparable maturity and quality, and less sensitive to stock market    
changes than common stocks. Because of these factors and the hybrid nature of   
convertible securities, Unit holders should recognize that convertible          
securities are likely to perform quite differently than broadly-based measures  
of the stock and bond markets.                                                  

While all markets are prone to change over time, the generally high rate at     
which convertible securities are retired (through conversion or redemption)     
and replaced with newly issued convertible securities causes the convertible    
securities market to change more rapidly than other markets. Due to the         
smaller, less liquid market for convertible securities, the bid-offer spread    
on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds,  
and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete.        
Moreover, convertible securities with innovative structures, such as mandatory  
conversion securities and equity-linked securities, have increased the          
sensitivity of this market to the volatility of the equity markets and to the   
special risks of those innovations. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading  
market will exist for any convertible security because these securities         
generally trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a        
securities exchange).                                                           

High-Yield Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in         
securities rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies (high-   
yield securities or "junk" bonds). High-yield securities held by Funds          
represent approximately _____% of the underlying assets of the Trust. High-     
yield, high-risk securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and      
risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings. The value of       
these securities will decline significantly with increases in interest rates,   
not only because increases in rates generally decrease values, but also         
because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown. An economic          
slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the     
issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain      
interest and principal payments.                                                

High-yield securities or "junk" bonds, the generic names for securities rated   
below "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's, are frequently    
issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by           
established companies that are highly leveraged or whose operations or          
industries are depressed. Obligations rated below "BBB-" should be considered   
speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade,  
and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared to investment      
grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally subordinated          
obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated      
securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities    
and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.         

The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for   
investment grade securities. High-yield securities are generally not listed on  
a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due   
to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield securities, the bid-offer     
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade  
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to       
complete.                                                                       

Investment Grade Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in   
investment grade securities. The value of these securities will decline with    
increases in interest rates, not only because increases in rates generally      
decrease values, but also because increased rates may indicate an economic      
slowdown. An economic slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's                   
creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings    
at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments.              

Master Limited Partnerships ("MLPs"). Certain of the Funds held by the Trust    
invest in MLPs. MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies    
that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units   
or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like     

Page 12                                                                         

shares of common stock. An MLP consists of a general partner and limited        
partners. The general partner manages the partnership, has an ownership stake   
in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution. The    
limited partners provide capital to the partnership, have a limited (if any)    
role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash        
distributions. The Trust's investment in Funds that hold MLPs, which are        
required to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order  
to not be subject to entity level taxation, often offers a yield advantage      
over other types of securities. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy,     
natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are      
subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and        
natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand  
risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. There are certain tax risks          
associated with MLPs in which the Funds held by the Trust may invest,           
including the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the Trust's     
treatment for federal income tax purposes of the MLPs in which the Funds held   
by the Trust invest. These tax risks, and any adverse determination with        
respect thereto, could have a negative impact on the after-tax income           
available for distribution by the MLPs and/or the value of the Trust's          
investments.                                                                    

Mortgage-Backed Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in    
mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities represent direct or      
indirect participations in, or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans  
secured by real property and can include single- and multi-class pass-through   
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Mortgage-backed securities  
are based on different types of mortgages, including those on commercial real   
estate or residential properties. These securities often have stated            
maturities of up to thirty years when they are issued, depending upon the       
length of the mortgages underlying the securities. In practice, however,        
unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on the underlying       
mortgages may make the securities' effective maturity shorter than this.        
Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-backed            
securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates, and may    
reduce the market value of the securities. In addition, mortgage-backed         
securities are subject to prepayment risk, the risk that borrowers may pay off  
their mortgages sooner than expected, particularly when interest rates          
decline. This can reduce the Funds', and therefore the Trust's, returns         
because the Funds may have to reinvest that money at lower prevailing interest  
rates.                                                                          

Options. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in call options. The     
value of an option may be adversely affected if the market for the option       
becomes less liquid or smaller, and will be affected by changes in the value    
and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option, an increase in interest  
rates, a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and  
the common stock and the remaining time to expiration. Additionally, the value  
of an option does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying   
stock (although they generally move in the same direction). However, as an      
option approaches its expiration date, its value increasingly moves with the    
price of the stock subject to an option. The strike price for an option may be  
adjusted downward before an option expiration triggered by certain corporate    
events affecting that stock. A downward adjustment to the strike price will     
have the effect of reducing the equity appreciation. Option strike prices may   
be adjusted to reflect certain corporate events such as extraordinary           
dividends, stock splits, merger or other extraordinary distributions or         
events. If the value of the underlying stock exceeds the strike price of an     
option, it is likely that the holder of that option will exercise their right   
to purchase the stock.                                                          

Preferred Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in          
preferred stocks. Preferred stocks are unique securities that combine some of   
the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds. Preferred stocks           
generally pay a fixed rate of return and are sold on the basis of current       
yield, like bonds. However, because they are equity securities, preferred       
stocks provide equity ownership of a company and the income is paid in the      
form of dividends. Preferred stocks typically have a yield advantage over       
common stocks as well as comparably-rated fixed income investments. Preferred   
stocks are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a      
company's capital structure, in terms of priority to corporate income, and      
therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments.   

Senior Loan Securities ("Senior Loans"). Certain of the Funds held by the       
Trust invest in Senior Loans issued by banks, other financial institutions,     
and other investors to corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies  
and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, mergers,    
acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt refinancings and, to a lesser extent,     
for general operating and other purposes. An investment in Senior Loans         
involves risk that the borrowers under Senior Loans may default on their        
obligations to pay principal or interest when due. Although Senior Loans may    
be secured by specific collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation   

Page 13                                                                         

of collateral would satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-      
payment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated. Senior Loans are   
typically structured as floating-rate instruments in which the interest rate    
payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result,   
the yield on Funds investing in Senior Loans will generally decline in a        
falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate        
environment. Senior Loans are generally below investment grade quality and may  
be unrated at the time of investment; are generally not registered with the     
SEC or state securities commissions; and are generally not listed on any        
securities exchange. See "Risk Factors-High-Yield Securities" for a             
description of the risks involved in investing in below investment grade        
securities. In addition, the amount of public information available on Senior   
Loans is generally less extensive than that available for other types of assets.

Foreign Securities. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in            
securities issued by foreign entities, which makes the Trust subject to more    
risks than if it only invested in Funds which invest solely in domestic         
securities. A foreign security is either directly listed on a U.S. securities   
exchange, is in the form of an American Depositary Receipt/ADR or a Global      
Depositary Receipt/GDR which trades on the over-the-counter market or is        
listed on a U.S. or foreign securities exchange, or is directly listed on a     
foreign securities exchange. Risks of foreign securities include higher         
brokerage costs; different accounting standards; expropriation,                 
nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments; currency   
devaluations, blockages or transfer restrictions; restrictions on foreign       
investments and exchange of securities; inadequate financial information; lack  
of liquidity of certain foreign markets; and less government supervision and    
regulation of exchanges, brokers, and issuers in foreign countries. Certain     
foreign markets have experienced heightened volatility due to recent negative   
political or economic developments or natural disasters. Securities issued by   
non-U.S. issuers may pay interest and/or dividends in foreign currencies and    
may be principally traded in foreign currencies. Therefore, there is a risk     
that the U.S. dollar value of these interest and/or dividend payments and/or    
securities will vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Investments   
in debt securities of foreign governments present special risks, including the  
fact that issuers may be unable or unwilling to repay principal and/or          
interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt, or may be unable   
to make such repayments when due in the currency required under the terms of    
the debt. Political, economic and social events also may have a greater impact  
on the price of debt securities issued by foreign governments than on the       
price of U.S. securities.                                                       

American Depositary Receipts/ADRs, Global Depositary Receipts/GDRs and          
similarly structured securities may be less liquid than the underlying shares   
in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the holders of       
depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary.     
Issuers of depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that   
is considered material in the United States. As a result, there may be less     
information available regarding such issuers. Holders of depositary receipts    
may have limited voting rights, and investment restrictions in certain          
countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such    
restrictions may limit the ability to convert shares into depositary receipts   
and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause shares of the underlying issuer to  
trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts.  

Emerging Markets. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust invest in securities   
issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging        
markets. Risks of investing in developing or emerging countries are even        
greater than the risks associated with foreign investments in general. These    
increased risks include, among other risks, the possibility of investment and   
trading limitations, greater liquidity concerns, higher price volatility,       
greater delays and disruptions in settlement transactions, greater political    
uncertainties and greater dependence on international trade or development      
assistance. In addition, emerging market countries may be subject to            
overburdened infrastructures, obsolete financial systems and environmental      
problems. For these reasons, investments in emerging markets are often          
considered speculative.                                                         

Small and/or Mid Capitalization Companies. Certain of the Funds held by the     
Trust invest in small and/or mid capitalization companies. Investing in stocks  
of such companies may involve greater risk than investing in larger companies.  
For example, such companies may have limited product lines, as well as shorter  
operating histories, less experienced management and more limited financial     
resources than larger companies. Securities of such companies generally trade   
in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable      
changes in price than securities of larger companies. In addition, small and    
mid-cap stocks may not be widely followed by the investment community, which    
may result in low demand.                                                       

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the        
securities held by the Funds held by the Trust will fall if interest rates      

Page 14                                                                         

increase. Securities typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise  
in value when interest rates fall. Securities with longer periods before        
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that a security's issuer is unable or      
unwilling to make dividend, interest or principal payments when due and the     
related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns       
about the issuer's ability or willingness to make such payments.                

Call Risk. Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond      
before its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall  
and the bond pays a higher than market interest rate or if the issuer no        
longer needs the money for its original purpose. A bond's call price could be   
less than the price the Fund paid for the bond and could be below the bond's    
par value. This means a Fund could receive less than the amount paid for the    
bond and may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in securities with as high a  
yield as the called bond. A Fund may contain bonds that have "make whole" call  
options that generally cause the bonds to be redeemable at any time at a        
designated price. Such bonds are generally more likely to be subject to early   
redemption and may result in the reduction of income received by the Fund.      

Extension Risk. If interest rates rise, certain obligations may be paid off by  
the obligor at a slower rate than expected, which will cause the value of such  
obligations to fall.                                                            

Leverage Risk. Certain of the Funds held by the Trust employ the use of         
leverage in their portfolios. Leverage may be structural leverage, through      
borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock, or effective leverage, which     
results from a Fund's investment in derivative instruments that are inherently  
leveraged. While leverage often serves to increase the yield of a Fund, this    
leverage also subjects the Fund to increased risks, including the likelihood    
of increased volatility and the possibility that the Fund's common share        
income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest   
rate on any borrowings rises.                                                   

Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the Securities held by   
the Trust will fluctuate. Market value fluctuates in response to various        
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial  
condition of a Securities' issuer, perceptions of the issuer, ratings on a      
bond, or political or economic events affecting the issuer. Because the Trust   
is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities in response to or in       
anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common in managed investments.       

Prepayment Risk. Many types of debt instruments are subject to prepayment       
risk, which is the risk that the issuer will repay principal prior to the       
maturity date. Debt instruments allowing prepayment may offer less potential    
for gains during a period of declining interest rates.                          

Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative initiatives are  
proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on    
certain of the Trust's investments. In addition, litigation regarding any of    
the issuers of the Securities, or the industries represented by these issuers,  
may negatively impact the value of these securities. We cannot predict what     
impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation  
will have on the value of the Trust's investments.                              

Additional Risks.                                                               

The following is a discussion of additional risks of investing in the Trust.    

Short Sales Risk. A Fund may engage in "short sale" transactions. A Fund will   
lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale    
increases in value. A Fund also may enter into a short derivative position      
through a futures contract. If the price of the security or derivative that is  
the subject of a short sale increases, then the Fund will incur a loss equal    
to the increase in price from the time that the short sale was entered into     
plus any premiums and interest paid to a third party in connection with the     
short sale. Therefore, short sales involve the risk that losses may be          
exaggerated, potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the          
investment. Also, there is the risk that the third party to the short sale may  
fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund.                   

Public Offering                   

The Public Offering Price.                                                      

Units will be purchased at the Public Offering Price, the price per Unit of     
which is comprised of the following:                                            

- The aggregate underlying value of the Securities;                             

- The amount of any cash in the Income and Capital Accounts;                    

- Dividends receivable on Securities; and                                       

- The maximum sales charge (which combines a deferred sales charge and the      
creation and development fee).                                                  

Page 15                                                                         

The price you pay for your Units will differ from the amount stated under       
"Summary of Essential Information" due to various factors, including            
fluctuations in the prices of the Securities and changes in the value of the    
Income and/or Capital Accounts.                                                 

Although you are not required to pay for your Units until three business days   
following your order (the "date of settlement"), you may pay before then. You   
will become the owner of Units ("Record Owner") on the date of settlement if    
payment has been received. If you pay for your Units before the date of         
settlement, we may use your payment during this time and it may be considered   
a benefit to us, subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of   
1934, as amended.                                                               

Organization Costs. Securities purchased with the portion of the Public         
Offering Price intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the Trust's     
organization costs (including costs of preparing the registration statement,    
the Indenture and other closing documents, registering Units with the SEC and   
states, the initial audit of the Trust's statement of net assets, legal fees    
and the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee) will be purchased in the      
same proportionate relationship as all the Securities contained in the Trust.   
Securities will be sold to reimburse the Sponsor for the Trust's organization   
costs at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the     
end of the initial offering period (a significantly shorter time period than    
the life of the Trust). During the period ending with the earlier of six        
months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering     
period, there may be a decrease in the value of the Securities. To the extent   
the proceeds from the sale of these Securities are insufficient to repay the    
Sponsor for Trust organization costs, the Trustee will sell additional          
Securities to allow the Trust to fully reimburse the Sponsor. In that event,    
the net asset value per Unit of the Trust will be reduced by the amount of      
additional Securities sold. Although the dollar amount of the reimbursement     
due to the Sponsor will remain fixed and will never exceed the per Unit amount  
set forth for the Trust in "Notes to Statement of Net Assets," this will        
result in a greater effective cost per Unit to Unit holders for the             
reimbursement to the Sponsor. To the extent actual organization costs are less  
than the estimated amount, only the actual organization costs will ultimately   
be charged to the Trust. When Securities are sold to reimburse the Sponsor for  
organization costs, the Trustee will sell Securities, to the extent             
practicable, which will maintain the same proportionate relationship among the  
Securities contained in the Trust as existed prior to such sale.                

Minimum Purchase.                                                               

The minimum amount per account you can purchase of the Trust is generally       
$1,000 worth of Units ($500 if you are purchasing Units for your Individual     
Retirement Account or any other qualified retirement plan), but such amounts    
may vary depending on your selling firm.                                        

Maximum Sales Charge.                                                           

The maximum sales charge during the initial offering period consists of a       
deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee. Both the deferred   
sales charge and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per  
Unit. Because of this, the maximum sales charge, as a percentage of the Public  
Offering Price, will vary with changes in the Public Offering Price. At a       
Public Offering Price of $10 per Unit, the maximum sales charge will be 3.95%.  
If the price you pay for your Units exceeds $10 per Unit, the maximum sales     
charge will be less than 3.95%. If the price you pay for your Units is less     
than $10 per Unit, the maximum sales charge will exceed 3.95%, but in no event  
will the maximum sales charge exceed 4.50%.                                     

Transactional Sales Charge.                                                     

The transactional sales charge you will pay is initially comprised of solely    
the deferred sales charge. If you purchase Units after the first deferred       
sales charge payment has been assessed, the transactional sales charge will     
also contain an initial sales charge, as described below.                       

Monthly Deferred Sales Charge. The deferred sales charge is equal to $.345 per  
Unit. Three monthly deferred sales charges of $.115 per Unit will be deducted   
from the Trust's assets on approximately the twentieth day of each month from   
January 20, 2017 through March 20, 2017. If you buy Units at a price of less    
than $10.00 per Unit, the dollar amount of the deferred sales charge will not   
change, but the deferred sales charge on a percentage basis will be more than   
3.45% of the Public Offering Price, but in no event will the maximum deferred   
sales charge exceed 4.00%.                                                      

If you purchase Units after the first deferred sales charge payment has been    
assessed, your maximum sales charge will consist of an initial sales charge     
and the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge payments. The initial     
sales charge, which you will pay at the time of purchase, is equal to the       
difference between 3.45% of the Public Offering Price and the sum of the        
maximum remaining deferred sales charge. If you purchase Units after the last   
deferred sales charge payment has been assessed, your maximum sales charge      
will consist of a one-time initial sales charge of 3.45% of the Public          
Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 3.573% of the net amount invested). The  

Page 16                                                                         

maximum sales charge will be reduced by 1/2 of 1% on each subsequent December   
31, commencing December 31, 2017, to a minimum transactional sales charge of    
3.00%.                                                                          

Creation and Development Fee.                                                   

As Sponsor, we will also receive, and the Unit holders will pay, a creation     
and development fee. See "Expenses and Charges" for a description of the        
services provided for this fee. The creation and development fee is a charge    
of $.050 per Unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If you   
buy Units at a price of less than $10.00 per Unit, the dollar amount of the     
creation and development fee will not change, but the creation and development  
fee on a percentage basis will be more than 0.50% of the Public Offering Price. 

Discounts for Certain Persons.                                                  

The maximum sales charge is $.395 per Unit and the maximum dealer concession    
is $.305 per Unit. However, if you invest at least $50,000 including any        
proceeds as described below (except if you are purchasing for "Fee Accounts"    
as described below), the maximum sales charge per Unit for the amount of the    
investment eligible to receive the reduced sales charge is reduced as follows:  

        Your maximum      Dealer

* The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders   
stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement   
that only whole Units be issued.                                                

The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases will apply only to purchases    
not eligible for the redemption or termination proceeds discount set forth      
below made by the same person on any one day from any one dealer. To help you   
reach the above levels, you can combine the Units you purchase of the Trust     
with any other same day purchases of other trusts for which we are Principal    
Underwriter and are currently in the initial offering period. In addition, we   
will also consider Units you purchase in the name of your spouse, or the        
equivalent if recognized under local law, or child (including step-children)    
under the age of 21 living in the same household to be purchases by you. The    
reduced sales charges will also apply to a trustee or other fiduciary           
purchasing Units for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account          
including pension, profit sharing or employee benefit plans, as well as         
multiple-employee benefit plans of a single employer or affiliated employers    
(provided they are not aggregated with personal accounts). You must inform      
your dealer of any combined purchases before the sale in order to be eligible   
for the reduced sales charge.                                                   

You are entitled to use your redemption or termination proceeds from any unit   
investment trust (regardless of who was sponsor) to purchase Units of the       
Trust during the initial offering period at the Public Offering Price less      
$0.10 per Unit (for purchases of $1,000,000 or more, the maximum sales charge   
will be limited to $0.245 per Unit), but you will not be eligible to receive    
the reduced sales charges described in the above table with respect to such     
proceeds. Please note that if you purchase Units of the Trust in this manner    
using redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining  
deferred sales charge at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred      
sales charge remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption    
proceeds. In order to be eligible to receive the reduced sales charge           
described in this paragraph, the trade date of the redemption or termination    
resulting in the receipt of such proceeds must have occurred within 30          
calendar days prior to your Unit purchase. In addition, this program will only  
be available for investors that utilize the same broker/dealer (or a different  
broker/dealer with appropriate notification) for both the Unit purchase and     
the transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption       
proceeds used for the Unit purchase and such transaction must be from the same  
account. You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other      
information to your broker/dealer to evidence your eligibility for this         
reduced sales charge program.                                                   

If you are purchasing Units for an investment account, the terms of which       
provide that your registered investment advisor or registered broker/dealer     
(a) charges periodic fees in lieu of commissions; (b) charges for financial     
planning, investment advisory or asset management services; or (c) charges a    
comprehensive "wrap fee" or similar fee for these or comparable services ("Fee  
Accounts"), you will not be assessed the transactional sales charge described   
in this section on such purchases. These Units will be designated as Fee        
Account Units and, depending upon the purchase instructions we receive,         
assigned either a Fee Account Cash CUSIP Number, if you elect to have           
distributions paid to you, or a Fee Account Reinvestment CUSIP Number, if you   
elect to have distributions reinvested into additional Units of the Trust.      
Certain Fee Account Unit holders may be assessed transaction or other account   
fees on the purchase and/or redemption of such Units by their registered        
investment advisor, broker/dealer or other processing organizations for         
providing certain transaction or account activities. Fee Account Units are not  

Page 17                                                                         

available for purchase in the secondary market. We reserve the right to limit   
or deny purchases of Units not subject to the transactional sales charge by     
investors whose frequent trading activity we determine to be detrimental to     
the Trust.                                                                      

Employees, officers and directors (and immediate family members) of the         
Sponsor, our related companies, and dealers and their affiliates will purchase  
Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession,       
subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Immediate family members   
include spouses, or the equivalent if recognized under local law, children or   
step-children under the age of 21 living in the same household, parents or      
step-parents and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such    
persons. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow their   
employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for     
the discounts.                                                                  

You will be charged the deferred sales charge per Unit regardless of any        
discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that the     
maximum sales charge you must pay is less than the applicable maximum deferred  
sales charge, including Fee Account Units, you will be credited additional      
Units with a dollar value equal to the difference between your maximum sales    
charge and the maximum deferred sales charge at the time you buy your Units.    
If you elect to have distributions reinvested into additional Units of the      
Trust, in addition to the reinvestment Units you receive you will also be       
credited additional Units with a dollar value at the time of reinvestment       
sufficient to cover the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge and       
creation and development fee to be collected on such reinvestment Units. The    
dollar value of these additional credited Units (as with all Units) will        
fluctuate over time, and may be less on the dates deferred sales charges or     
the creation and development fee are collected than their value at the time     
they were issued.                                                               

The Value of the Securities.                                                    

The Evaluator will determine the aggregate underlying value of the Securities   
in the Trust as of the Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust     
the Public Offering Price of the Units according to this valuation. This        
Public Offering Price will be effective for all orders received before the      
Evaluation Time on each such day. If we or the Trustee receive orders for       
purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day which is not a     
business day, they will be held until the next determination of price. The      
term "business day" as used in this prospectus shall mean any day on which the  
NYSE is open.                                                                   

The aggregate underlying value of the Securities in the Trust will be           
determined as follows: if the Securities are listed on a national or foreign    
securities exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC(R), their value shall       
generally be based on the closing sale price on the exchange or system which    
is the principal market therefore ("Primary Exchange"), which shall be deemed   
to be the NYSE if the Securities are listed thereon (unless the Evaluator       
deems such price inappropriate as the basis for evaluation). In the event a     
closing sale price on the Primary Exchange is not published, the Securities     
will be valued based on the last trade price on the Primary Exchange. If no     
trades occur on the Primary Exchange for a specific trade date, the value will  
be based on the closing sale price from, in the opinion of the Evaluator, an    
appropriate secondary exchange, if any. If no trades occur on the Primary       
Exchange or any appropriate secondary exchange on a specific trade date, the    
Evaluator will determine the value of the Securities using the best             
information available to the Evaluator, which may include the prior day's       
evaluated price. If the Security is an American Depositary Receipt/ADR, Global  
Depositary Receipt/GDR or other similar security in which no trade occurs on    
the Primary Exchange or any appropriate secondary exchange on a specific trade  
date, the value will be based on the evaluated price of the underlying          
security, determined as set forth above, after applying the appropriate         
ADR/GDR ratio, the exchange rate and such other information which the           
Evaluator deems appropriate. For purposes of valuing Securities traded on The   
NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC(R), closing sale price shall mean the Nasdaq(R)        
Official Closing Price as determined by The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC(R). If     
the Securities are not so listed or, if so listed and the principal market      
therefore is other than on the Primary Exchange or any appropriate secondary    
exchange, the value shall generally be based on the current ask price on the    
over-the-counter market (unless the Evaluator deems such price inappropriate    
as a basis for evaluation). If current ask prices are unavailable, the value    
is generally determined (a) on the basis of current ask prices for comparable   
securities, (b) by appraising the value of the Securities on the ask side of    
the market, or (c) any combination of the above. If such prices are in a        
currency other than U.S. dollars, the value of such Security shall be           
converted to U.S. dollars based on current exchange rates (unless the           
Evaluator deems such prices inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If the    
Evaluator deems a price determined as set forth above to be inappropriate as    
the basis for evaluation, the Evaluator shall use such other information        

Page 18                                                                         

available to the Evaluator which it deems appropriate as the basis for          
determining the value of a Security.                                            

After the initial offering period is over, the aggregate underlying value of    
the Securities will be determined as set forth above, except that bid prices    
are used instead of ask prices when necessary.                                  

Distribution of Units                   

We intend to qualify Units of the Trust for sale in a number of states. All     
Units will be sold at the then current Public Offering Price.                   

The Sponsor compensates intermediaries, such as broker/dealers and banks, for   
their activities that are intended to result in sales of Units of the Trust.    
This compensation includes dealer concessions described in the following        
section and may include additional concessions and other compensation and       
benefits to broker/dealers and other intermediaries.                            

Dealer Concessions.                                                             

Dealers and other selling agents can purchase Units at prices which represent   
a concession or agency commission of $0.305 per Unit (or 65% of the maximum     
transactional sales charge for secondary market sales), subject to the reduced  
concession applicable to volume purchases as set forth in "Public Offering-     
Discounts for Certain Persons." However, for Units subject to a transactional   
sales charge which are purchased using redemption or termination proceeds,      
this amount will be reduced to $0.21 per Unit ($0.170 per Unit for purchases    
of $1,000,000 or more).                                                         

Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents who, during the previous         
consecutive 12-month period through the end of the most recent month, sold      
primary market units of unit investment trusts sponsored by us in the dollar    
amounts shown below will be entitled to the following additional sales          
concession on primary market sales of units during the current month of unit    
investment trusts sponsored by us:

Dealers and other selling agents will not receive a concession on the sale of   
Units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge, but such Units     
will be included in determining whether the above volume sales levels are met.  
Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing firms that      
place orders with First Trust and provide First Trust with information with     
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible        
dealer firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely        
provide clearing services to other broker/dealer firms or firms who place       
orders through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We reserve the right   
to change the amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to time.    
Certain commercial banks may be making Units of the Trust available to their    
customers on an agency basis. A portion of the transactional sales charge paid  
by these customers is kept by or given to the banks in the amounts shown above. 

Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker/Dealers.                              

The Sponsor, at its own expense and out of its own profits, currently provides  
additional compensation and benefits to broker/dealers who sell Units of this   
Trust and other First Trust products. This compensation is intended to result   
in additional sales of First Trust products and/or compensate broker/dealers    
and financial advisors for past sales. A number of factors are considered in    
determining whether to pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include,  
but are not limited to, the level or type of services provided by the           
intermediary, the level or expected level of sales of First Trust products by   
the intermediary or its agents, the placing of First Trust products on a        
preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary's personnel,   
and other factors. The Sponsor makes these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    

Page 19                                                                         

retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an      
intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in             
broker/dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the  
Sponsor's products. The Sponsor makes such payments to a substantial majority   
of intermediaries that sell First Trust products. The Sponsor may also make     
certain payments to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of     
their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating Unit sales, such as the    
costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process Unit trades.       
Payments of such additional compensation described in this and the preceding    
paragraph, some of which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create  
an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or           
recommend a First Trust product, including the Trust, over products offered by  
other sponsors or fund companies. These arrangements will not change the price  
you pay for your Units.                                                         

Advertising and Investment Comparisons.                                         

Advertising materials regarding the Trust may discuss several topics,           
including: developing a long-term financial plan; working with your financial   
professional; the nature and risks of various investment strategies and unit    
investment trusts that could help you reach your financial goals; the           
importance of discipline; how the Trust operates; how securities are selected;  
various unit investment trust features such as convenience and costs; and       
options available for certain types of unit investment trusts. These materials  
may include descriptions of the principal businesses of the companies           
represented in the Trust, research analysis of why they were selected and       
information relating to the qualifications of the persons or entities           
providing the research analysis. In addition, they may include research         
opinions on the economy and industry sectors included and a list of investment  
products generally appropriate for pursuing those recommendations.              

From time to time we may compare the estimated returns of the Trust (which may  
show performance net of the expenses and charges the Trust would have           
incurred) and returns over specified periods of other similar trusts we         
sponsor in our advertising and sales materials, with (1) returns on other       
taxable investments such as the common stocks comprising various market         
indexes, corporate or U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market          
accounts or funds, (2) performance data from Morningstar, Inc. or (3)           
information from publications such as Money, The New York Times, U.S. News and  
World Report, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes or Fortune. The investment         
characteristics of the Trust differ from other comparative investments. You     
should not assume that these performance comparisons will be representative of  
the Trust's future performance. We may also, from time to time, use             
advertising which classifies trusts or portfolio securities according to        
capitalization and/or investment style.                                         

The Sponsor's Profits                   

We will receive a gross sales commission equal to the maximum transactional     
sales charge per Unit of the Trust less any reduction as stated in "Public
Offering." We will also receive the amount of any collected creation and        
development fee. Also, any difference between our cost to purchase the          
Securities and the price at which we sell them to the Trust is considered a     
profit or loss (see Note 2 of "Schedule of Investments"). During the initial    
offering period, dealers and others may also realize profits or sustain losses  
as a result of fluctuations in the Public Offering Price they receive when      
they sell the Units.                                                            

In maintaining a market for the Units, any difference between the price at      
which we purchase Units and the price at which we sell or redeem them will be   
a profit or loss to us.                                                         

The Secondary Market                    

Although not obligated, we may maintain a market for the Units after the        
initial offering period and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices      
based on the Redemption Price per Unit.                                         

We will pay all expenses to maintain a secondary market, except the Evaluator   
fees and Trustee costs to transfer and record the ownership of Units. We may    
discontinue purchases of Units at any time. IF YOU WISH TO DISPOSE OF YOUR      
UNITS, YOU SHOULD ASK US FOR THE CURRENT MARKET PRICES BEFORE MAKING A TENDER   
FOR REDEMPTION TO THE TRUSTEE. If you sell or redeem your Units before you      
have paid the total deferred sales charge on your Units, you will have to pay   
the remainder at that time.                                                     

How We Purchase Units                   

The Trustee will notify us of any tender of Units for redemption. If our bid    
at that time is equal to or greater than the Redemption Price per Unit, we may  
purchase the Units. You will receive your proceeds from the sale no later than  

Page 20                                                                         

if they were redeemed by the Trustee. We may tender Units we hold to the        
Trustee for redemption as any other Units. If we elect not to purchase Units,   
the Trustee may sell tendered Units in the over-the-counter market, if any.     
However, the amount you will receive is the same as you would have received on  
redemption of the Units.                                                        

Expenses and Charges                    

The estimated annual expenses of the Trust are listed under "Fee Table." If     
actual expenses exceed the estimate, the Trust will bear the excess. The        
Trustee will pay operating expenses of the Trust from the Income Account if     
funds are available, and then from the Capital Account. The Income and Capital  
Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, so the Trustee may earn      
interest on these funds, thus benefiting from their use. In addition,           
investors will also indirectly pay a portion of the expenses of the underlying  
Funds.                                                                          

First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of ours, acts as Portfolio Supervisor   
and Evaluator and will be compensated for providing portfolio supervisory       
services and evaluation services as well as bookkeeping and other               
administrative services to the Trust. In providing portfolio supervisory        
services, the Portfolio Supervisor may purchase research services from a        
number of sources, which may include underwriters or dealers of the Trust. As   
Sponsor, we will receive brokerage fees when the Trust uses us (or an           
affiliate of ours) as agent in buying or selling Securities. As authorized by   
the Indenture, the Trustee may employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the Trustee  
to act as broker to execute certain transactions for the Trust. The Trust will  
pay for such services at standard commission rates.                             

The fees payable to First Trust Advisors L.P. and the Trustee are based on the  
largest aggregate number of Units of the Trust outstanding at any time during   
the calendar year, except during the initial offering period, in which case     
these fees are calculated based on the largest number of Units outstanding      
during the period for which compensation is paid. These fees may be adjusted    
for inflation without Unit holders' approval, but in no case will the annual    
fee paid to us or our affiliates for providing services to all unit investment  
trusts be more than the actual cost of providing such services in such year.    

As Sponsor, we will receive a fee from the Trust for creating and developing    
the Trust, including determining the Trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for          
providing other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The           
"creation and development fee" is a charge of $.050 per Unit outstanding at     
the end of the initial offering period. The Trustee will deduct this amount     
from the Trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. We do   
not use this fee to pay distribution expenses or as compensation for sales      
efforts. This fee will not be deducted from your proceeds if you sell or        
redeem your Units before the end of the initial offering period.                

In addition to the Trust's operating expenses, and those fees described above,  
the Trust may also incur the following charges:                                 

- All legal expenses of the Trustee according to its responsibilities under     
the Indenture;                                                                  

- The expenses and costs incurred by the Trustee to protect the Trust and your  
rights and interests;                                                           

- Fees for any extraordinary services the Trustee performed under the Indenture;

- Payment for any loss, liability or expense the Trustee incurred without       
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, in connection with     
its acceptance or administration of the Trust;                                  

- Payment for any loss, liability or expenses we incurred without negligence,   
bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Sponsor of the Trust;              

- Foreign custodial and transaction fees (which may include compensation paid   
to the Trustee or its subsidiaries or affiliates), if any; and/or               

- All taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Securities or any     
part of the Trust.                                                              

The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee are secured by a lien on the    
Trust. In addition, if there is not enough cash in the Income or Capital        
Account, the Trustee has the power to sell Securities to make cash available    
to pay these charges which may result in capital gains or losses to you. See    
"Tax Status."

Tax Status                    

Federal Tax Matters.                                                            

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences   
of owning Units of the Trust. This section is current as of the date of this    
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these           
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, except as specifically provided below, these summaries generally do    
not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a      

Page 21                                                                         

broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this  
section may not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.         

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to    
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") could disagree with any       
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked   
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income  
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be       
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual         
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status.                                                                   

The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company," commonly      
known as a "RIC," under the federal tax laws. If the Trust qualifies as a RIC   
and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the Trust generally      
will not pay federal income taxes.                                              

For federal income tax purposes, you are treated as the owner of Trust Units    
and not of the assets held by the Trust. Taxability issues are taken into       
account at the trust level. Your federal income tax treatment of income from    
the Trust is based on the distributions paid by the Trust.                      

Income From the Trust.                                                          

Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of each year, you      
will receive a tax statement that separates the Trust's distributions into      
ordinary dividends, capital gains dividends and returns of capital. Income      
reported is generally net of expenses (but see Deductibility of Trust           
Expenses, below). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your     
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary        
income distributions received from the Trust may be taxed at the capital gains  
tax rates. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term   
capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. To determine    
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate  
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of   
your other taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, the Trust     
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your               
distributions from the Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your       
distributions in additional Units or receive them in cash. The income from the  
Trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not    
reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws    
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had     
received them on December 31 of the previous year.                              

Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from   
the Trust may also be subject to a 3.8% "Medicare tax." This tax will           
generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income     
exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married    
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.    

Distributions with Respect to Certain Stock Dividends.                          

Ordinary income dividends received by an individual Unit holder from a          
regulated investment company such as the Trust are generally taxed at the same  
rates that apply to net capital gain, as discussed below, provided certain      
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are        
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the Trust itself. Dividends    
that do not meet these requirements will generally be taxed at ordinary income  
rates. The Trust will provide notice to its Unit holders of the amount of any   
distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible    
for the capital gains tax rates.                                                

Dividends Received Deduction.                                                   

A corporation that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends   
received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the Trust       
because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for         
distributions from regulated investment companies. However, certain ordinary    
income dividends on Units that are attributable to qualifying dividends         
received by the Trust from certain corporations may be reported by the Trust    
as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.                         

Sale or Redemption of Units.                                                    

If you sell or redeem your Units, you will generally recognize a taxable gain   
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in your Units from the amount you receive in the transaction. Your    
tax basis in your Units is generally equal to the cost of your Units,           
generally including sales charges. In some cases, however, you may have to      
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.                            

The information statement you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of    
your Units may contain information about your basis in the Units and whether    
any gain or loss recognized by you should be considered long-term or short-     
term capital gain. The information reported to you is based upon rules that do  
not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or your          

Page 22                                                                         

advisors. You should consult with your tax advisors about any adjustments that  
may need to be made to the information reported to you.                         

Capital Gains and Losses.                                                       

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net         
capital gain is generally 20% (0% for certain taxpayers in the 10% or 15% tax   
brackets). An additional 3.8% "Medicare tax" may also apply to gain from the    
sale or redemption of Units of the Trust, subject to the income thresholds as   
described above.                                                                

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term         
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date     
you purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you       
receive a capital gain dividend from the Trust and sell your Units at a loss    
after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as    
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.     
The tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less  
are generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code        
treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.          

Capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is           
considered "unrecaptured section 1250 gain" is taxed at a maximum stated tax    
rate of 25%. In the case of capital gains dividends, the determination of       
which portion of the capital gains dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax  
rate, will be made based on rules prescribed by the United States Treasury.     

In-Kind Distributions.                                                          

Under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus, you may request    
an In-Kind Distribution of Trust assets when you redeem your Units at any time  
prior to 10 business days before the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date. By     
electing to receive an In-Kind Distribution, you will receive Trust assets      
plus, possibly, cash. THIS DISTRIBUTION IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION, AND YOU WILL    
GENERALLY RECOGNIZE GAIN OR LOSS, GENERALLY BASED ON THE VALUE AT THAT TIME OF  
THE SECURITIES AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED. The IRS could, however, assert  
that a loss could not be currently deducted.                                    

Deductibility of Trust Expenses.                                                

Expenses incurred and deducted by the Trust will generally not be treated as    
income taxable to you. In some cases, however, you may be required to treat     
your portion of these Trust expenses as income. In these cases you may be able  
to take a deduction for these expenses. However, certain miscellaneous          
itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be deducted by            
individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed 2% of the    
individual's adjusted gross income. Also, certain individuals may also be       
subject to a phase-out of the deductibility of itemized deductions based upon   
their income.                                                                   

Investments in Certain Foreign Corporations.                                    

If the Trust holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment        
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such    
as interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that   
hold at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive         
income, the Trust could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional    
interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those       
equity interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its   
Unit holders. Similarly, if the Trust invests in a fund (a "Portfolio Fund")    
that invests in PFICs, the Portfolio Fund may be subject to such taxes. The     
Trust will not be able to pass through to its Unit holders any credit or        
deduction for such taxes whenever the taxes are imposed at the Trust level or   
on a Portfolio Fund. The Trust (or the Portfolio Fund) may be able to make an   
election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences. In this case,    
the Trust (or the Portfolio Fund) would recognize as ordinary income any        
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease    
in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in       
income. Under this election, the Trust (or the Portfolio Fund) might be         
required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from      
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and    
such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and   
would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax. Dividends paid   
by PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend income.                      

Foreign Investors.                                                              

If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or   
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you should be    
aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties, distributions from   
the Trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes    
(other than dividends which the Trust properly reports as capital gain          
dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding      
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. However, except as        
described below, distributions received by a foreign investor from the Trust    
that are properly reported by such Trust as capital gain dividends may not be   

Page 23                                                                         

subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided     
that the Trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.    
Distributions from the Trust that are properly reported by the Trust as an      
interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest income received by   
the Trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net  
short-term capital gain income received by the Trust may not be subject to      
U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, when received by        
certain foreign investors, provided that the Trust makes certain elections and  
certain other conditions are met.                                               

Distributions may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of    
distributions to or dispositions by (i) certain non-U.S. financial              
institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to  
collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a              
jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury     
and (ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain            
certifications and information about the entity's U.S. owners. Dispositions of  
Units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31,
2018.                                                                           

Foreign Tax Credit.                                                             

If at least 50% of the value of the total assets of the Trust (at the close of  
the taxable year) is represented by foreign securities or at least 50% of the   
value of the total assets of the Trust (at the close of each quarter of the     
taxable year) is represented by interests in other RICs, the tax statement      
that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes the Trust paid to    
other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your share   
of the taxes the Trust paid to other countries. You may be able to deduct or    
receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                             

You should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or       
local taxation with respect to your Units.                                      

Retirement Plans                    

You may purchase Units of the Trust for:                                        

- Individual Retirement Accounts,                                               

- Keogh Plans,                                                                  

- Pension funds, and                                                            

- Other tax-deferred retirement plans.                                          

Generally, the federal income tax on capital gains and income received in each  
of the above plans is deferred until you receive distributions. These           
distributions are generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases,  
be eligible for special averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment. Before    
participating in a plan like this, you should review the tax laws regarding     
these plans and consult your attorney or tax advisor. Brokerage firms and       
other financial institutions offer these plans with varying fees and charges.   

Rights of Unit Holders                    

Unit Ownership.                                                                 

Ownership of Units will not be evidenced by certificates. If you purchase or    
hold Units through a broker/dealer or bank, your ownership of Units will be     
recorded in book-entry form at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and         
credited on its records to your broker/dealer's or bank's DTC account.          
Transfer of Units will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and its      
participants if the Units are registered to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co. DTC  
will forward all notices and credit all payments received in respect of the     
Units held by the DTC participants. You will receive written confirmation of    
your purchases and sales of Units from the broker/dealer or bank through which  
you made the transaction. You may transfer your Units by contacting the         
broker/dealer or bank through which you hold your Units.                        

Unit Holder Reports.                                                            

The Trustee will prepare a statement detailing the per Unit amounts (if any)    
distributed from the Income Account and Capital Account in connection with      
each distribution. In addition, at the end of each calendar year, the Trustee   
will prepare a statement which contains the following information:              

- A summary of transactions in the Trust for the year;                          

- A list of any Securities sold during the year and the Securities held at the  
end of that year by the Trust;                                                  

- The Redemption Price per Unit, computed on the 31st day of December of such   
year (or the last business day before); and                                     

- Amounts of income and capital distributed during the year.                    

It is the responsibility of the entity through which you hold your Units to     
distribute these statements to you. In addition, you may also request from the  
Trustee copies of the evaluations of the Securities as prepared by the          
Evaluator to enable you to comply with applicable federal and state tax         
reporting requirements.                                                         

Page 24                                                                         

Income and Capital Distributions                    

You will begin receiving distributions on your Units only after you become a    
Record Owner. The Trustee will credit any dividends received on the Trust's     
Securities to the Income Account. All other receipts, such as return of         
capital or capital gain dividends, are credited to the Capital Account.         

The Trustee will make distributions on or near the Income Distribution Dates    
to Unit holders of record on the preceding Income Distribution Record Date.     
Distributions will consist of an amount substantially equal to the Unit         
holder's pro rata share of the balance of the Income Account calculated on the  
basis of one-twelfth of the estimated annual dividend distributions (reset on   
a quarterly basis) in the Income Account after deducting estimated expenses.    
See "Summary of Essential Information." The amount of the initial distribution  
from the Income Account will be prorated based on the number of days in the     
first payment period. No income distribution will be paid if accrued expenses   
of the Trust exceed amounts in the Income Account on the Distribution Dates.    
Distribution amounts will vary with changes in the Trust's fees and expenses,   
in dividends received and with the sale of Securities. The Trustee will         
distribute amounts in the Capital Account, net of amounts designated to meet    
redemptions, pay the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee or  
pay expenses on the twenty-fifth day of each month to Unit holders of record    
on the tenth day of each month provided the amount equals at least $1.00 per    
100 Units. In any case, the Trustee will distribute any funds in the Capital    
Account in December of each year and as part of the final liquidation           
distribution. If the Trustee does not have your TIN, it is required to          
withhold a certain percentage of your distribution and deliver such amount to   
the IRS. You may recover this amount by giving your TIN to the Trustee, or      
when you file a tax return. However, you should check your statements to make   
sure the Trustee has your TIN to avoid this "back-up withholding."              

If an Income or Capital Account distribution date is a day on which the NYSE    
is closed, the distribution will be made on the next day the stock exchange is  
open. Distributions are paid to Unit holders of record determined as of the     
close of business on the Record Date for that distribution or, if the Record    
Date is a day on which the NYSE is closed, the first preceding day on which     
the exchange is open.                                                           

We anticipate that there will be enough money in the Capital Account of the     
Trust to pay the deferred sales charge. If not, the Trustee may sell            
Securities to meet the shortfall.                                               

Within a reasonable time after the Trust is terminated, you will receive the    
pro rata share of the money from the sale of the Securities. All Unit holders   
will receive a pro rata share of any other assets remaining in the Trust after  
deducting any unpaid expenses.                                                  

The Trustee may establish reserves (the "Reserve Account") within the Trust to  
cover anticipated state and local taxes or any governmental charges to be paid  
out of the Trust.                                                               

Distribution Reinvestment Option. You may elect to have each distribution of    
income and/or capital reinvested into additional Units of the Trust by          
notifying your broker/dealer or bank within the time period required by such    
entities so that they can notify the Trustee of your election at least 10 days  
before any Record Date. Each later distribution of income and/or capital on     
your Units will be reinvested by the Trustee into additional Units of such      
Trust. There is no sales charge on Units acquired through the Distribution      
Reinvestment Option, as discussed under "Public Offering." This option may not  
be available in all states. Each reinvestment plan is subject to availability   
or limitation by the Sponsor and each broker/dealer or selling firm. The        
Sponsor or broker/dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a            
reinvestment plan at any time. Because the Trust may begin selling Securities   
nine business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date, reinvestment is     
not available during this period. Please contact your financial professional    
for additional information. PLEASE NOTE THAT EVEN IF YOU REINVEST               
DISTRIBUTIONS, THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERED DISTRIBUTIONS FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. 

Redeeming Your Units                    

You may redeem all or a portion of your Units at any time by sending a request  
for redemption to your broker/dealer or bank through which you hold your        
Units. No redemption fee will be charged, but you are responsible for any       
governmental charges that apply. Certain broker/dealers may charge a            
transaction fee for processing redemption requests. Three business days after   
the day you tender your Units (the "Date of Tender") you will receive cash in   
an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit calculated at    
the Evaluation Time on the Date of Tender.                                      

The Date of Tender is considered to be the date on which your redemption        
request is received by the Trustee from the broker/dealer or bank through       
which you hold your Units (if such day is a day the NYSE is open for trading).  

Page 25                                                                         

However, if the redemption request is received after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time     
(or after any earlier closing time on a day on which the NYSE is scheduled in   
advance to close at such earlier time), the Date of Tender is the next day the  
NYSE is open for trading.                                                       

Any amounts paid on redemption representing income will be withdrawn from the   
Income Account if funds are available for that purpose, or from the Capital     
Account. All other amounts paid on redemption will be taken from the Capital    
Account. The IRS will require the Trustee to withhold a portion of your         
redemption proceeds if the Trustee does not have your TIN as generally          
discussed under "Income and Capital Distributions."                             

If you tender for redemption at least 2,500 Units, or such larger amount as     
required by your broker/dealer or bank, rather than receiving cash, you may     
elect to receive an In-Kind Distribution in an amount equal to the Redemption   
Price per Unit by making this request to your broker/dealer or bank at the      
time of tender. However, to be eligible to participate in the In-Kind           
Distribution option at redemption, Unit holders must hold their Units through   
the end of the initial offering period. No In-Kind Distribution requests        
submitted during the 10 business days prior to the Trust's Mandatory            
Termination Date will be honored. Where possible, the Trustee will make an In-  
Kind Distribution by distributing each of the Securities in book-entry form to  
your bank's or broker/dealer's account at DTC. The Trustee will subtract any    
customary transfer and registration charges from your In-Kind Distribution. As  
a tendering Unit holder, you will receive your pro rata number of whole shares  
of Securities that make up the portfolio, and cash from the Capital Account     
equal to the fractional shares to which you are entitled.                       

If you elect to receive an In-Kind Distribution of Securities, you should be    
aware that it will be considered a taxable event at the time you receive the    
Securities. See "Tax Status" for additional information.                        

The Trustee may sell Securities to make funds available for redemption. If      
Securities are sold, the size and diversification of the Trust will be          
reduced. These sales may result in lower prices than if the Securities were     
sold at a different time.                                                       

Your right to redeem Units (and therefore, your right to receive payment) may   
be delayed:                                                                     

- If the NYSE is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings);    

- If the SEC determines that trading on the NYSE is restricted or that an       
emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the Securities not reasonably     
practical; or                                                                   

- For any other period permitted by SEC order.                                  

The Trustee is not liable to any person for any loss or damage which may        
result from such a suspension or postponement.                                  

The Redemption Price.                                                           

The Redemption Price per Unit is determined by the Trustee by:                  

adding                                                                          

1. cash in the Income and Capital Accounts not designated to purchase           
Securities;                                                                     

2. the aggregate underlying value of the Securities held in the Trust; and      

3. dividends receivable on the Securities trading ex-dividend as of the date    
of computation; and                                                             

deducting                                                                       

1. any applicable taxes or governmental charges that need to be paid out of     
the Trust;                                                                      

2. any amounts owed to the Trustee for its advances;                            

3. estimated accrued expenses of the Trust, if any;                             

4. cash held for distribution to Unit holders of record of the Trust as of the  
business day before the evaluation being made;                                  

5. liquidation costs for foreign Securities, if any; and                        

6. other liabilities incurred by the Trust; and                                 

dividing                                                                        

1. the result by the number of outstanding Units of the Trust.                  

Any remaining deferred sales charge on the Units when you redeem them will be   
deducted from your redemption proceeds. In addition, until they are collected,  
the Redemption Price per Unit will include estimated organization costs as set  
forth under "Fee Table."

Removing Securities from the Trust                    

The portfolio of the Trust is not managed. However, we may, but are not         
required to, direct the Trustee to dispose of a Security in certain limited     
circumstances, including situations in which:                                   

- The issuer of the Security defaults in the payment of a declared dividend;    

- Any action or proceeding prevents the payment of dividends;                   

- There is any legal question or impediment affecting the Security;             

- The issuer of the Security has breached a covenant which would affect the     

Page 26                                                                         

payment of dividends, the issuer's credit standing, or otherwise damage the     
sound investment character of the Security;                                     

- The issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its outstanding       
obligations;                                                                    

- There has been a public tender offer made for a Security or a merger or       
acquisition is announced affecting a Security, and that in our opinion the      
sale or tender of the Security is in the best interest of Unit holders;         

- The sale of Securities is necessary or advisable (i) in order to maintain     
the qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment company" or (ii) to   
provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid     
imposition of any income or excise taxes on undistributed income in the Trust;  

- The price of the Security has declined to such an extent, or such other       
credit factors exist, that in our opinion keeping the Security would be         
harmful to the Trust;                                                           

- As a result of the ownership of the Security, the Trust or its Unit holders   
would be a direct or indirect shareholder of a passive foreign investment       
company; or                                                                     

- The sale of the Security is necessary for the Trust to comply with such       
federal and/or state securities laws, regulations and/or regulatory actions     
and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time.                   

Except for instances in which the Trust acquires Replacement Securities, as     
described in "The FT Series," the Trust will generally not acquire any          
securities or other property other than the Securities. The Trustee, on behalf  
of the Trust and at the direction of the Sponsor, will vote for or against any  
offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a Security,   
such as those acquired in a merger or other transaction. If such exchanged      
securities or property are acquired by the Trust, at our instruction, they      
will either be sold or held in the Trust. In making the determination as to     
whether to sell or hold the exchanged securities or property we may get advice  
from the Portfolio Supervisor. Any proceeds received from the sale of           
Securities, exchanged securities or property will be credited to the Capital    
Account of the Trust for distribution to Unit holders or to meet redemption     
requests. The Trustee may retain and pay us or an affiliate of ours to act as   
agent for the Trust to facilitate selling Securities, exchanged securities or   
property from the Trust. If we or our affiliate act in this capacity, we will   
be held subject to the restrictions under the 1940 Act. When acting in an       
agency capacity, we may select various broker/dealers to execute securities     
transactions on behalf of the Trust, which may include broker/dealers who sell  
Units of the Trust. We do not consider sales of Units of the Trust or any       
other products sponsored by First Trust as a factor in selecting such           
broker/dealers. As authorized by the Indenture, the Trustee may also employ a   
subsidiary or affiliate of the Trustee to act as broker in selling such         
Securities or property. The Trust will pay for these brokerage services at      
standard commission rates.                                                      

The Trustee may sell Securities designated by us; or, absent our direction, at  
its own discretion, in order to meet redemption requests or pay expenses. In    
designating Securities to be sold, we will try to maintain the proportionate    
relationship among the Securities. If this is not possible, the composition     
and diversification of the Trust may be changed.                                

Amending or Terminating the Indenture                   

Amendments. The Indenture may be amended by us and the Trustee without your     
consent:                                                                        

- To cure ambiguities;                                                          

- To correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision;             

- To make any amendment required by any governmental agency; or                 

- To make other changes determined not to be adverse to your best interests     
(as determined by us and the Trustee).                                          

Termination. As provided by the Indenture, the Trust will terminate on the      
Mandatory Termination Date as stated in the "Summary of Essential               
Information." The Trust may be terminated earlier:                              

- Upon the consent of 100% of the Unit holders of the Trust;                    

- If the value of the Securities owned by the Trust as shown by any evaluation  
is less than the lower of $2,000,000 or 20% of the total value of Securities    
deposited in the Trust during the initial offering period ("Discretionary       
Liquidation Amount"); or                                                        

- In the event that Units of the Trust not yet sold aggregating more than 60%   
of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by underwriters,         
including the Sponsor.                                                          

If the Trust is terminated due to this last reason, we will refund your entire  
sales charge; however, termination of the Trust before the Mandatory            
Termination Date for any other stated reason will result in all remaining       
unpaid deferred sales charges on your Units being deducted from your            
termination proceeds. For various reasons, the Trust may be reduced below the   

Page 27                                                                         

Discretionary Liquidation Amount and could therefore be terminated before the   
Mandatory Termination Date.                                                     

Unless terminated earlier, the Trustee will begin to sell Securities in         
connection with the termination of the Trust during the period beginning nine   
business days prior to, and no later than, the Mandatory Termination Date. We   
will determine the manner and timing of the sale of Securities. Because the     
Trustee must sell the Securities within a relatively short period of time, the  
sale of Securities as part of the termination process may result in a lower     
sales price than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at  
this time.                                                                      

You will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining             
Securities, along with your interest in the Income and Capital Accounts,        
within a reasonable time after the Trust is terminated. The Trustee will        
deduct from the Trust any accrued costs, expenses, advances or indemnities      
provided for by the Indenture, including estimated compensation of the Trustee  
and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to pay any       
taxes or other governmental charges.                                            

Information on the Sponsor, Trustee and Evaluator                   

The Sponsor.

This information refers only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any      
series of the Trust or to any other dealer. We are including this information

Code of Ethics. The Sponsor and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics         
requiring the Sponsor's employees who have access to information on Trust       
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the     
code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,          
deception or misconduct with respect to the Trust.                              

The Trustee.                                                                    

The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under     
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its unit investment       
trust division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286,         
telephone 800-813-3074. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Trust, please contact the Trustee at its unit investment trust division         
offices or your financial advisor. The Sponsor does not have access to          
individual account information. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to       
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of the New York State         
Department of Financial Services and the Board of Governors of the Federal      
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                                     

The Trustee has not participated in selecting the Securities; it only provides  
administrative services.                                                        

Limitations of Liabilities of Sponsor and Trustee.                              

Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for taking any action or for not      
taking any action in good faith according to the Indenture. We will also not    
be accountable for errors in judgment. We will only be liable for our own       
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence (ordinary negligence in the    
Trustee's case) or reckless disregard of our obligations and duties. The        
Trustee is not liable for any loss or depreciation when the Securities are      
sold. If we fail to act under the Indenture, the Trustee may do so, and the     
Trustee will not be liable for any action it takes in good faith under the      
Indenture.                                                                      

The Trustee will not be liable for any taxes or other governmental charges or   
interest on the Securities which the Trustee may be required to pay under any   
present or future law of the United States or of any other taxing authority     
with jurisdiction. Also, the Indenture states other provisions regarding the    
liability of the Trustee.

If we do not perform any of our duties under the Indenture or are not able to   
act or become bankrupt, or if our affairs are taken over by public              
authorities, then the Trustee may:                                              

- Appoint a successor sponsor, paying them a reasonable rate not more than      
that stated by the SEC,                                                         

- Terminate the Indenture and liquidate the Trust, or                           

- Continue to act as Trustee without terminating the Indenture.

Risk Factors

Securities. The Securities in the Trust may represent common stock ("Common
Stocks"), preferred stock ("Preferred Stocks"), trust preferred securities      
("Trust Preferred Securities"), real estate investment trusts ("REITs"),        
exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), closed-end funds ("Closed-End Funds") and/or    
business development companies. As such, an investment in Units of the Trust    
should be made with an understanding of the risks of investing in such          
Securities.                                                                     

Common Stocks. An investment in common stocks should be made with an            
understanding of the risks which such an investment entails, including the      
risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the common stocks or the    
general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen, and the value of     
the common stocks and therefore the value of the Units may decline. Common      
stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to      
volatile increases and decreases of value, as market confidence in and          
perceptions of the issuers change. These perceptions are based on               
unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic,   
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion  
or contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises.   
Both U.S. and foreign markets have experienced substantial volatility and       
significant declines recently as a result of certain or all of these factors.   

Shareholders of common stocks have rights to receive payments from the issuers  
of those common stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors     
of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks of, such issuers.        
Shareholders of common stocks have a right to receive dividends only when and   
if, and in the amounts, declared by the issuer's board of directors and have a  
right to participate in amounts available for distribution by the issuer only   
after all other claims on the issuer have been paid or provided for. Common     
stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and, therefore, do not      
offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of       

Page 1                                                                          

capital as do debt securities. The issuance of additional debt securities or    
preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal, interest     
and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the   
issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of         
holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation   
or bankruptcy. Cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common  
stock dividends, and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added   
to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock.       
Preferred stockholders are also generally entitled to rights on liquidation     
which are senior to those of common stockholders.                               

Preferred Stocks. An investment in preferred stocks should be made with an      
understanding of the risks which such an investment entails, including the      
risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the Securities or the       
general condition of the preferred stock market may worsen, and the value of    
the preferred stocks and therefore the value of the Units may decline.          
Preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to    
volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and           
perceptions of the issuers change. These perceptions are based on               
unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic,   
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion  
or contraction, market liquidity, and global or regional political, economic    
or banking crises. Preferred stocks are also vulnerable to Congressional        
reductions in the dividends received deduction which would adversely affect     
the after-tax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction.  
Such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in        
general. Holders of preferred stocks, as owners of the entity, have rights to   
receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally  
subordinate to those of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or, in     
some cases, other senior preferred stocks of, such issuers. Preferred stocks    
do not represent an obligation of the issuer and, therefore, do not offer any   
assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do   
debt securities. The issuance of additional debt securities or senior           
preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and          
interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and      
inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock    
or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the       
issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. The value of preferred stocks is         
subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain       
outstanding, and thus the value of the Securities may be expected to fluctuate  
over the life of the Trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on   
the Initial Date of Deposit.                                                    

Trust Preferred Securities. An investment in trust preferred securities should  
be made with an understanding of the risks which such an investment entails.    
Holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly    
different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks. Trust preferred   
securities are limited-life preferred securities that are typically issued by   
corporations, generally in the form of interest-bearing notes or preferred      
securities, or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in   
the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the       
corporation, or similarly structured securities. The maturity and dividend      
rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity     
and coupon interest rate of the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities    
or subordinated debentures. Trust preferred securities usually mature on the    
stated maturity date of the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or     
subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated   
maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call  
date or upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary circumstances at any       
time. Trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over          
traditional preferred stocks, but unlike preferred stocks, distributions on     
the trust preferred securities are treated as interest rather than dividends    
for Federal income tax purposes. Unlike most preferred stocks, distributions    
received from trust preferred securities are not eligible for the dividends-    
received deduction. Certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities   
include: (i) distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if   
interest payments on the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or        
subordinated debentures are made; (ii) a corporation issuing the interest-      
bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer        
interest payments on these instruments for up to 20 consecutive quarters and    
if such election is made, distributions will not be made on the trust           
preferred securities during the deferral period; (iii) certain tax or           
regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interest-bearing notes,     
preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and  
result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated    
maturity date; (iv) future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may      
prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interest-  
bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax          
purposes, making redemption of these instruments likely; (v) a corporation may  
redeem the interest-bearing notes, preferred securities or subordinated         
debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a      
stated call date; (vi) trust preferred securities holders have very limited     
voting rights; and (vii) payment of interest on the interest-bearing notes,     

Page 2                                                                          

preferred securities or subordinated debentures, and therefore distributions    
on the trust preferred securities, is dependent on the financial condition of   
the issuing corporation.                                                        

REITs. An investment in REITs should be made with an understanding of the       
risks which such an investment entails. Generally, these include economic       
recession, the cyclical nature of real estate markets, competitive              
overbuilding, unusually adverse weather conditions, changing demographics,      
changes in governmental regulations (including tax laws and environmental,      
building, zoning and sales regulations), increases in real estate taxes or      
costs of material and labor, the inability to secure performance guarantees or  
insurance as required, the unavailability of investment capital and the         
inability to obtain construction financing or mortgage loans at rates           
acceptable to builders and purchasers of real estate. Additional risks include  
an inability to reduce expenditures associated with a property (such as         
mortgage payments and property taxes) when rental revenue declines, and         
possible loss upon foreclosure of mortgaged properties if mortgage payments     
are not paid when due.                                                          

REITs are financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of        
capital from a number of investors in order to participate directly in real     
estate ownership or financing. REITs are generally fully integrated operating   
companies that have interests in income-producing real estate. Equity REITs     
emphasize direct property investment, holding their invested assets primarily   
in the ownership of real estate or other equity interests. REITs obtain         
capital funds for investment in underlying real estate assets by selling debt   
or equity securities in the public or institutional capital markets or by bank  
borrowing. Thus, the returns on common equities of REITs will be significantly  
affected by changes in costs of capital and, particularly in the case of        
highly "leveraged" REITs (i.e., those with large amounts of borrowings          
outstanding), by changes in the level of interest rates. The objective of an    
equity REIT is to purchase income-producing real estate properties in order to  
generate high levels of cash flow from rental income and a gradual asset        
appreciation, and they typically invest in properties such as office, retail,   
industrial, hotel and apartment buildings and healthcare facilities.            

REITs are a creation of the tax law. REITs essentially operate as a             
corporation or business trust with the advantage of exemption from corporate    
income taxes provided the REIT satisfies the requirements of Sections 856       
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. The major tests for tax-qualified     
status are that the REIT (i) be managed by one or more trustees or directors,   
(ii) issue shares of transferable interest to its owners, (iii) have at least   
100 shareholders, (iv) have no more than 50% of the shares held by five or      
fewer individuals, (v) invest substantially all of its capital in real estate   
related assets and derive substantially all of its gross income from real       
estate related assets and (vi) distributed at least 95% of its taxable income   
to its shareholders each year. If a REIT should fail to qualify for such tax    
status, the related shareholders (including such Trust) could be adversely      
affected by the resulting tax consequences.                                     

The underlying value of REITs and their ability to pay dividends may be         
adversely affected by changes in national economic conditions, changes in       
local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions  
and neighborhood characteristics, increased competition from other properties,  
obsolescence of property, changes in the availability, cost and terms of        
mortgage funds, the impact of present or future environmental legislation and   
compliance with environmental laws, the ongoing need for capital improvements,  
particularly in older properties, changes in real estate tax rates and other    
operating expenses, regulatory and economic impediments to raising rents,       
adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies, dependency on        
management skill, civil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, fires and   
other natural disasters (which may result in uninsured losses), acts of war,    
adverse changes in zoning laws, and other factors which are beyond the control  
of the issuers of REITs. The value of REITs may at times be particularly        
sensitive to devaluation in the event of rising interest rates.                 

REITs may concentrate investments in specific geographic areas or in specific   
property types, i.e., hotels, shopping malls, residential complexes, office     
buildings and timberlands. The impact of economic conditions on REITs can also  
be expected to vary with geographic location and property type. Investors       
should be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to the risks  
of financing projects. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers, self-   
liquidation, the market's perception of the REIT industry generally, and the    
possibility of failing to qualify for pass-through of income under the          
Internal Revenue Code, and to maintain exemption from the Investment Company    
Act of 1940. A default by a borrower or lessee may cause a REIT to experience   
delays in enforcing its right as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant   
costs related to protecting its investments. In addition, because real estate   
generally is subject to real property taxes, REITs may be adversely affected    
by increases or decreases in property tax rates and assessments or              
reassessments of the properties underlying REITs by taxing authorities.         
Furthermore, because real estate is relatively illiquid, the ability of REITs   
to vary their portfolios in response to changes in economic and other           

Page 3                                                                          

conditions may be limited and may adversely affect the value of the Units.      
There can be no assurance that any REIT will be able to dispose of its          
underlying real estate assets when advantageous or necessary.                   

Issuers of REITs generally maintain comprehensive insurance on presently owned  
and subsequently acquired real property assets, including liability, fire and   
extended coverage. However, certain types of losses may be uninsurable or not   
be economically insurable as to which the underlying properties are at risk in  
their particular locales. There can be no assurance that insurance coverage     
will be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement  
cost of any lost investment. Various factors might make it impracticable to     
use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or       
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received by a REIT  
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to such     
property.                                                                       

Under various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of    
real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of          
hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often    
impose liability whether or not the owner or operator caused or knew of the     
presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage   
of such substances was in violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, the       
presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such     
property properly, may adversely affect the owner's ability to borrow using     
such real property as collateral. No assurance can be given that REITs may not  
be presently liable or potentially liable for any such costs in connection      
with real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire.             

ETFs. An investment in ETFs should be made with an understanding of the risks   
which such an investment entails. ETFs are investment pools that hold other     
securities. ETFs are either passively-managed index funds that seek to          
replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index or    
actively-managed funds that seek to achieve a stated investment objective.      
ETFs are either open-end management investment companies or unit investment     
trusts registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Unlike  
typical open-end funds or unit investment trusts, ETFs generally do not sell    
or redeem their individual shares at net asset value. ETFs generally sell and   
redeem shares in large blocks (often known as "Creation Units"), however, the   
Sponsor does not intend to sell or redeem ETFs in this manner. In addition,     
securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading, which allow investors to      
purchase and sell individual ETF shares among themselves at market prices       
throughout the day. The Trust will purchase and sell ETF shares on these        
securities exchanges. ETFs therefore possess characteristics of traditional     
open-end funds and unit investment trusts, which issue redeemable shares, and   
of corporate common stocks or closed-end funds, which generally issue shares    
that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable. 

ETFs can provide exposure to broad-based indexes, growth and value styles,      
market cap segments, sectors and industries, specific countries or regions of   
the world or physical commodities. The securities comprising ETFs may be        
common stocks, fixed-income securities or physical commodities. ETFs contain a  
number of securities, anywhere from fewer than 20 securities up to more than    
1,000 securities. As a result, investors in ETFs obtain exposure to a much      
greater number of securities than an individual investor would typically be     
able to obtain on their own. The performance of index-based ETFs is generally   
highly correlated with the indices or sectors which they are designed to track. 

ETFs are subject to various risks, including management's ability to meet the   
fund's investment objective, and to manage the fund's portfolio when the        
underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil    
and as investors' perceptions regarding ETFs or their underlying investments    
change.                                                                         

Shares of ETFs frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in     
the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that     
the net asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such          
discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in         
response to various factors.                                                    

Closed-End Funds. An investment in closed-end funds should be made with an      
understanding of the risks which such an investment entails. Closed-end mutual  
funds' portfolios are managed and their shares are generally listed on a        
securities exchange. The net asset value of closed-end fund shares will         
fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying securities which the      
closed-end fund owns. In addition, for various reasons closed-end fund shares   
frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary      
market. The amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change   
from time to time in response to various factors. Closed-end funds' articles    
of incorporation may contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may have     
the effect of inhibiting a fund's possible conversion to open-end status and    
limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund. In certain  
circumstances, these provisions might also inhibit the ability of stockholders  
(including the Trust) to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market  
prices. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that  
a fund's net asset value will decrease. In particular, this characteristic      
would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those closed-end    

Page 4                                                                          

fund shares which were purchased by a Trust at a premium. In the unlikely       
event that a closed-end fund converts to open-end status at a time when its     
shares are trading at a premium there would be an immediate loss in value to a  
Trust since shares of open-end funds trade at net asset value. Certain closed-  
end funds may have in place or may put in place in the future plans pursuant    
to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the marketplace. Typically,  
these plans are put in place in an attempt by a fund's board of directors to    
reduce a discount on its share price. To the extent such a plan was             
implemented and shares owned by a Trust are repurchased by a fund, the Trust's  
position in that fund would be reduced and the cash would be distributed.       

A Trust is prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares of any   
of the closed-end funds in which they invest. In the event of a rights          
offering for additional shares of a fund, Unit holders should expect that       
their Trust will, at the completion of the offer, own a smaller proportional    
interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case. It is not possible to   
determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without knowing what   
proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed. This may be   
particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the offer is     
less than the fund's net asset value per share. Assuming that all rights are    
exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share, the          
aggregate net asset value of each shareholder's shares of common stock should   
decrease as a result of the offer. If a fund's subscription price per share is  
below that fund's net asset value per share at the expiration of the offer,     
shareholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset  
value of their shares of common stock as a result of the offer, which could be  
substantial.                                                                    

Closed-end funds may utilize leveraging in their portfolios. Leveraging can be  
expected to cause increased price volatility for those fund's shares, and as a  
result, increased volatility for the price of the Units of a Trust. There can   
be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any        
period in which it is employed.                                                 

Business Development Companies. An investment in business development           
companies should be made with an understanding of the risks which such an       
investment entails. Business development companies' portfolios are managed and  
their shares are generally listed on a securities exchange. Business            
development companies are closed-end funds which have elected to be treated as  
business development companies. The net asset value of business development     
company shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying       
securities which the business development company fund owns. In addition, for   
various reasons business development company shares frequently trade at a       
discount from their net asset value in the secondary market. The amount of      
such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in    
response to various factors. Business development companies' articles of        
incorporation may contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may have the    
effect of inhibiting a fund's possible conversion to open-end status and        
limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund. In certain  
circumstances, these provisions might also inhibit the ability of stockholders  
(including the Trust) to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market  
prices. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that  
a fund's net asset value will decrease. In particular, this characteristic      
would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those business      
development company shares which were purchased by the Trust at a premium. In   
the unlikely event that a business development company converts to open-end     
status at a time when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an     
immediate loss in value to a Trust since shares of open-end funds trade at net  
asset value. Certain business development companies may have in place or may    
put in place in the future plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its  
own shares in the marketplace. Typically, these plans are put in place in an    
attempt by a fund's board of directors to reduce a discount on its share        
price. To the extent such a plan was implemented and shares owned by the Trust  
are repurchased by a fund, the Trust's position in that fund would be reduced   
and the cash would be distributed.                                              

A Trust is prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares of any   
of the business development companies in which they invest. In the event of a   
rights offering for additional shares of a fund, Unit holders should expect     
that their Trust will, at the completion of the offer, own a smaller            
proportional interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case. It is not  
possible to determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without    
knowing what proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed.  
This may be particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the  
offer is less than the fund's net asset value per share. Assuming that all      
rights are exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share,   
the aggregate net asset value of each shareholder's shares of common stock      
should decrease as a result of the offer. If a fund's subscription price per    
share is below that fund's net asset value per share at the expiration of the   
offer, shareholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate     
net asset value of their shares of common stock as a result of the offer,       
which could be substantial.                                                     

Page 5                                                                          

Business development companies may utilize leveraging in their portfolios.      
Leveraging can be expected to cause increased price volatility for those        
fund's shares, and as a result, increased volatility for the price of the       
Units of a Trust. There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be  
successful during any period in which it is employed.                           

Convertible Securities. The following section applies to individual Trusts      
which contain Securities which invest in convertible securities. Convertible    
securities include convertible subordinated debentures and corporate bonds      
("Convertible Bonds") and cumulative convertible preferred stocks               
("Convertible Preferred Stocks"). Convertible securities contain a conversion   
privilege which, under specified circumstances, offers the holder the right to  
exchange such security for common stock of the issuing corporation.             
Convertible Bonds obligate the issuing company to pay a stated annual rate of   
interest (or a stated dividend in the case of Convertible Preferred Stocks)     
and to return the principal amount after a specified period of time. The        
income offered by convertible securities is generally higher than the           
dividends received from the underlying common stock, but lower than similar     
quality non-convertible debt securities. Convertible securities are usually     
priced at a premium to their conversion value, i.e., the value of the common    
stock received if the holder were to exchange the convertible security.         

The holder of the convertible security may choose at any time to exchange the   
convertible security for a specified number of shares of the common stock of    
the corporation, or occasionally a subsidiary company, at a specified price,    
as defined by the corporation when the security is issued. Accordingly, the     
value of the convertible obligation may generally be expected to increase       
(decrease) as the price of the associated common stock increases (decreases).   
Also, the market value of convertible securities tends to be influenced by the  
level of interest rates and tends to decline as interest rates increase and,    
conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. Convertible securities rank  
senior to common stocks in an issuer's capital structure, but are junior to     
non-convertible debt securities. As convertible securities are considered       
junior to any non-convertible debt securities issued by the corporation,        
convertible securities are typically rated by established credit ratings        
agencies at one level below the rating on such corporation's non-convertible    
debt.                                                                           

Convertible securities are hybrid securities, combining the investment          
characteristics of both bonds and common stock. Like a bond (or preferred       
stock), a convertible security pays interest at a fixed rate (dividend), but    
may be converted into common stock at a specified price or conversion rate.     

When the conversion price of the convertible security is significantly above    
the price of the issuer's common stock, a convertible security takes on the     
risk characteristics of a bond. At such times, the price of a convertible       
security will vary inversely with changes in the level of interest rates. In    
other words, when interest rates rise, prices of convertible securities will    
generally fall; conversely, when interest rates fall, prices of convertible     
securities will generally rise. This interest rate risk is in part offset by    
the income paid by the convertible securities.                                  

In contrast, when the conversion price of a convertible security and the        
common stock price are close to one another, a convertible security will        
behave like a common stock. In such cases, the prices of convertible            
securities may exhibit the short-term price volatility characteristic of        
common stocks.                                                                  

For these reasons Unit holders must be willing to accept the market risks of    
both bonds and common stocks. However, because convertible securities have      
characteristics of both common stocks and bonds, they tend to be less           
sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds of comparable maturity and        
quality, and less sensitive to stock market changes than fully invested common  
stock portfolios. Because of these factors and the hybrid nature of             
convertible securities, Unit holders should recognize that convertible          
securities are likely to perform quite differently than broadly-based measures  
of the stock and bond markets.                                                  

The market for convertible securities includes a larger proportion of small-    
to medium-size companies than the broad stock market (as measured by such       
indices as the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index). Companies    
which issue convertible securities are often lower in credit quality,           
typically rated below "Investment Grade." Moreover, the credit rating of a      
company's convertible issuance is generally lower than the rating of the        
company's conventional debt issues since the convertible security is normally   
a "junior" security. Securities with such ratings are considered speculative,   
and thus pose a greater risk of default than investment grade securities.       

High-risk securities may be thinly traded, which can adversely affect the       
prices at which such securities can be sold and can result in high transaction  
costs. Judgment plays a greater role in valuing high risk securities than       
securities for which more extensive quotations and last sale information are    
available. Adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the   
ability of outside price services to value securities.                          

Page 6                                                                          

During an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates,     
the ability of issuers of debt to serve their payment obligations, meet         
projected goals, or obtain additional financing may be impaired.                

Convertible securities are subject to the risk that the financial condition of  
the issuers of the convertible securities or the general condition of the       
stock market or bond market may worsen and the value of the convertible         
securities and therefore the value of the Units may decline. Convertible        
securities may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to          
increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of     
the issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable factors        
including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal      
policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and  
global or regional political, economic or banking crises. Convertible           
Preferred Stocks are also subject to Congressional reductions in the dividends- 
received deduction which would adversely affect the after-tax return to the     
corporate investors who can take advantage of the deduction. Such reductions    
also might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general. Holders   
of preferred stocks have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those   
preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of, or    
holders of debt obligations or, in some cases, senior preferred stocks of,      
such issuers. Convertible Preferred Stocks do not represent an obligation of    
the issuer and, therefore, do not offer any assurance of income (since          
dividends on a preferred stock must be declared by the issuer's Board of        
Directors) or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt       
securities. Cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common     
stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added    
to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock. The   
issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stock will create    
prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which   
could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or  
pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred      
stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. The  
value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the  
preferred stocks remain outstanding, and thus the value of the Convertible      
Preferred Stocks in the Funds may be expected to fluctuate over the life of     
the Trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the Date of        
Deposit. Holders of Convertible Preferred Stocks incur more risk than holders   
of debt obligations because preferred stockholders, as owners of the entity,    
have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in           
comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations       
issued by the issuer.                                                           

Convertible Bonds are typically subordinated debentures and, therefore, the     
claims of senior creditors must be settled in full before any payment will be   
made to holders of Convertible Bonds in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy.  
Senior creditors typically include all other long-term debt issuers and bank    
loans. Convertible Bonds do, however, have a priority over common and           
preferred stock. Investors in Convertible Bonds pay for the conversion          
privilege by accepting a significantly lower yield-to-maturity than that        
concurrently offered by non-convertible bonds of equivalent quality.            

Whether or not the convertible securities are listed on a national securities   
exchange, the principal trading market for the convertible securities may be    
in the over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading  
market for the convertible securities may depend on whether dealers will make   
a market in the convertible securities. There can be no assurance that a        
market will be made for any of the convertible securities, that any market for  
the convertible securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the        
convertible securities in any markets made.                                     

Issues of Convertible Bonds and Convertible Preferred Stocks generally provide  
that the convertible security may be liquidated, either by a partial scheduled  
redemption pursuant to a sinking fund or by a refunding redemption pursuant to  
which, at the option of the issuer, all or part of the issue can be retired     
from any available funds, at prices which may or may not include a premium      
over the involuntary liquidation preference, which generally is the same as     
the par or stated value of the convertible security. In general, optional       
redemption provisions are more likely to be exercised when the convertible      
security is valued at a premium over par or stated value than when they are     
valued at a discount from par or stated value. Generally, the value of the      
convertible security will be at a premium over par when market interest rates   
fall below the coupon rate.                                                     

Fixed-Income Securities. The following section applies to individual Trusts     
which contain Securities which invest in fixed-income securities. Fixed-income  
securities, in many cases, do not have the benefit of covenants which would     
prevent the issuer from engaging in capital restructurings or borrowing         
transactions in connection with corporate acquisitions, leveraged buyouts or    
restructurings which could have the effect of reducing the ability of the       
issuer to meet its debt obligations and might result in the ratings of the      
securities and the value of the underlying Trust portfolio being reduced.       

Page 7                                                                          

Fixed-income securities may have been acquired at a market discount from par    
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the  
time they were purchased were lower than the current market interest rates for  
newly issued securities of comparable rating and type. If such interest rates   
for newly issued comparable securities increase, the market discount of         
previously issued securities will become greater, and if such interest rates    
for newly issued comparable securities decline, the market discount of          
previously issued securities will be reduced, other things being equal.         
Investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market   
discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market    
premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase,     
the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster     
than securities purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates   
rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium securities and the        
prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount securities will be reduced. A   
discount security held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total      
return in the form of capital gain and less in the form of interest income      
than a comparable security newly issued at current market rates. Market         
discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market    
confidence in the issue. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable    
in any way for any default, failure or defect in any of the securities.         

Fixed-income securities may be original issue discount securities or zero       
coupon securities. Under current law, the original issue discount, which is     
the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue    
price of the securities, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued   
portion is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. On sale  
or redemption, any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of     
original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is      
attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount  
is taxable as ordinary income. The current value of an original discount        
security reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at           
maturity. The market value tends to increase in greater increments as the       
securities approach maturity. The effect of owning deep discount zero coupon    
Securities which do not make current interest payments is that a fixed yield    
is earned not only on the original investment, but also, in effect, on all      
earnings during the life of the discount obligation. This implicit              
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable   
to reinvest the income on such obligations at a rate as high as the implicit    
yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's  
ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, the zero    
coupon securities are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations       
during periods of changing interest rates than are securities of comparable     
quality which make regular interest payments.                                   

Fixed-income securities may have been acquired at a market premium from par     
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the   
time they were purchased were higher than the current market interest rates     
for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type. If such interest     
rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease, the        
market premium of previously issued securities will be increased, and if such   
interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase, the market      
premium of previously issued securities will be reduced, other things being     
equal. The current returns of securities trading at a market premium are        
initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities of a         
similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium      
securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the  
face amount becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus         
returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early redemption  
of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in   
a reduction in yield. Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will,    
and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when     
the redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a      
premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the   
accreted value. To the extent that the securities were purchased at a price     
higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss    
of capital.                                                                     

Certain fixed-income securities may be subject to being called or redeemed in   
whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional          
redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions or otherwise. A security         
subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding     
prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method by       
which a security issue is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds of   
a new security issue. A security subject to sinking fund redemption is one      
which is subject to partial call from time to time at par or from a fund        
accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue prior to      
maturity. Redemption pursuant to call provisions is more likely to occur, and   
redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur, when the securities   
have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for      
original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value.           

Page 8                                                                          

High-Yield Securities. The following section applies to individual Trusts       
which contain Securities which invest in high-yield securities. An investment   
in high-yield securities should be made with an understanding of the risks      
that an investment in high-yield, high-risk, fixed-rate, domestic and foreign   
securities or "junk" bonds may entail, including increased credit risks and     
the risk that the value of high-yield securities will decline, and may decline  
precipitously, with increases in interest rates. In recent years there have     
been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of fixed-rate    
securities generally. High-yield securities are, under most circumstances,      
subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and           
principal than are investments in lower-yielding, higher-rated securities, and  
their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates,   
not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values, but also     
because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease   
in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of        
issuers of high-yield, high-risk securities resulting in a higher incidence of  
defaults among high-yield, high-risk securities. A slowdown in the economy, or  
a development adversely affecting an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in   
the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at  
the prices, respectively, that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to  
meet its interest and principal requirements. For an issuer that has            
outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated high-yield, high- 
risk securities, an increase in interest rates will increase that issuer's      
interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating.  
However, many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements  
to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt. This     
reduces exposure to increasing rates, but reduces the benefit to the issuer of  
declining rates. The Sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their   
consequences or, therefore, the course or extent of any similar market          
fluctuations in the future.                                                     

High-yield securities or "junk" bonds, the generic names for securities rated   
below "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's, or below "Baa3" by Moody's, are frequently   
issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development, by             
established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by        
highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions. The      
market for high-yield securities is very specialized and investors in it have   
been predominantly financial institutions. High-yield securities are generally  
not listed on a national securities exchange. Trading of high-yield             
securities, therefore, takes place primarily in over-the-counter markets which  
consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms.    
Because the high-yield security market is a dealer market, rather than an       
auction market, no single obtainable price for a given security prevails at     
any given time. Prices are determined by negotiation between traders. The       
existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether   
dealers will make a market in the securities. There can be no assurance that a  
market will be made for any of the securities, that any market for the          
securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any      
markets made. Not all dealers maintain markets in all high-yield securities.    
Therefore, since there are fewer traders in these securities than there are in  
"investment grade" securities, the bid-offer spread is usually greater for      
high-yield securities than it is for investment grade securities.               

Lower-rated securities tend to offer higher yields than higher-rated            
securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the         
issuers of lower-rated securities may not be as strong as that of other         
issuers. Moreover, if a fixed-income security is recharacterized as equity by   
the Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes, the issuer's      
interest deduction with respect to the security will be disallowed and this     
disallowance may adversely affect the issuer's credit rating. Because           
investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with       
lower-rated securities, the yields and prices of these securities tend to       
fluctuate more than higher-rated securities with changes in the perceived       
quality of the credit of their issuers. In addition, the market value of high-  
yield, high-risk, fixed-income securities may fluctuate more than the market    
value of higher-rated securities since high-yield, high-risk, fixed-income      
securities tend to reflect short-term credit development to a greater extent    
than higher-rated securities. Lower-rated securities generally involve greater  
risks of loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. Issuers of  
lower-rated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than  
issuers of higher-rated securities and, especially in the case of issuers       
whose obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded, may be      
subject to claims by debtholders, owners of property leased to the issuer or    
others which, if sustained, would make it more difficult for the issuers to     
meet their payment obligations. High-yield, high-risk securities are also       
affected by variables such as interest rates, inflation rates and real growth   
in the economy. Therefore, investors should consider carefully the relative     
risks associated with investment in securities which carry lower ratings.       

Should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or        
interest, the Securities in the Trust may incur additional expenses seeking     
payment on the defaulted security. Because amounts (if any) recovered by the    

Page 9                                                                          

Securities in the Trust in payment under the defaulted security may not be      
reflected in the value of the Securities until actually received by the         
Securities and depending upon when a Unit holder purchases or sells his or her  
Units, it is possible that a Unit holder would bear a portion of the cost of    
recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered.                

High-yield, high-risk securities are generally subordinated obligations. The    
payment of principal (and premium, if any), interest and sinking fund           
requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is           
subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the    
issuer. Senior obligations generally include most, if not all, significant      
debt obligations of an issuer, whether existing at the time of issuance of      
subordinated debt or created thereafter. Upon any distribution of the assets    
of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution, total or partial   
liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer,  
the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full  
before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any     
payment. Moreover, generally no payment with respect to subordinated            
indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any       
senior indebtedness. Thus, in the event of insolvency, holders of senior        
indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more, ratably, than holders    
of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer.                                    

Obligations that are rated lower than "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's, or "Baa3"    
by Moody's, respectively, should be considered speculative as such ratings      
indicate a quality of less than investment grade. Investors should carefully    
review the objective of the Trust and consider their ability to assume the      
risks involved before making an investment in the Trust.                        

Senior Loans. The following section applies to individual Trusts which contain  
Securities which invest in Senior Loans issued by banks, other financial        
institutions, and other investors to corporations, partnerships, limited        
liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts,            
recapitalizations, mergers, acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt refinancings  
and, to a lesser extent, for general operating and other purposes. An           
investment by Securities in Senior Loans involves risk that the borrowers       
under Senior Loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or         
interest when due. Although Senior Loans may be secured by specific             
collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would      
satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-payment or that such      
collateral could be readily liquidated. Senior Loans are typically structured   
as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the          
obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on     
Securities investing in Senior Loans will generally decline in a falling        
interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.   
Senior Loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated    
at the time of investment; are generally not registered with the SEC or state   
securities commissions; and are generally not listed on any securities          
exchange. In addition, the amount of public information available on Senior     
Loans is generally less extensive than that available for other types of assets.

Subprime Residential Mortgage Loans. The following section applies to           
individual Trusts which contain Securities which invest in subprime             
residential mortgage loans. An investment in subprime residential mortgage      
loans should be made with an understanding of the risks which such an           
investment entails, including increased credit risks and the risk that the      
value of subprime residential mortgage loans will decline, and may decline      
precipitously, with increases in interest rates. In a high interest rate        
environment, the value of subprime residential mortgage loans may be adversely  
affected when payments on the mortgages do not occur as anticipated, resulting  
in the extension of the mortgage's effective maturity and the related increase  
in interest rate sensitivity of a longer-term investment. The value of          
subprime mortgage loans may also change due to shifts in the market's           
perception of issuers and regulatory or tax changes adversely affecting the     
mortgage securities markets as a whole. Due to current economic conditions,     
including fluctuating interest rates and declining home values, as well as      
aggressive lending practices, subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods    
experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss,   
and they are likely to continue to experience rates that are higher, and that   
may be substantially higher, than those experienced by mortgage loans           
underwritten in a more traditional manner. Thus, because of the higher          
delinquency rates and losses associated with subprime mortgage loans, risks of  
investing in Securities which hold subprime mortgage loans are similar to       
those which affect high-yield securities or "junk" bonds, which include less    
liquidity, greater volatility and an increased risk of default as compared to   
higher rated securities.                                                        

TIPS. The following section applies to individual Trusts which contain          
Securities which invest in TIPs. TIPS are inflation-indexed fixed-income        
securities issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury that utilize an inflation  
mechanism tied to the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). TIPS are backed by the      
full faith and credit of the United States. TIPS are offered with coupon        

Page 10                                                                         

interest rates lower than those of nominal rate Treasury securities. The        
coupon interest rate remains fixed throughout the term of the securities.       
However, each day the principal value of the TIPS is adjusted based upon a pro- 
rata portion of the CPI as reported three months earlier. Future interest       
payments are made based upon the coupon interest rate and the adjusted          
principal value. In a falling inflationary environment, both interest payments  
and the value of the TIPS will decline.                                         

Foreign Issuers. The following section applies to individual Trusts which       
contain Securities issued by, or invest in securities issued by, foreign        
entities. Since certain of the Securities held by the Trust consist of, or      
invest in, securities issued by foreign entities, an investment in the Trust    
involves certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an   
investment in a trust which invests solely in the securities of domestic        
entities. These investment risks include future political or governmental       
restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of  
dividends on the relevant Securities, the possibility that the financial        
condition of the issuers of the Securities may become impaired or that the      
general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen (both of which would  
contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the Securities and thus in    
the value of the Units), the limited liquidity and relatively small market      
capitalization of the relevant securities market, expropriation or              
confiscatory taxation, economic uncertainties and foreign currency              
devaluations and fluctuations. In addition, for foreign issuers that are not    
subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,   
as amended, there may be less publicly available information than is available  
from a domestic issuer. Also, foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to    
uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and   
requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers. The            
securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more        
volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers. In addition, fixed     
brokerage commissions and other transaction costs on foreign securities         
exchanges are generally higher than in the United States and there is           
generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges, brokers and  
issuers in foreign countries than there is in the United States. However, due   
to the nature of the issuers of the Securities selected for the Trust, the      
Sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the       
Supervisor to provide portfolio surveillance for the Trust.                     

Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may pay interest and/or dividends in      
foreign currencies and may be principally traded in foreign currencies.         
Therefore, there is a risk that the U.S. dollar value of these interest and/or  
dividend payments and/or securities will vary with fluctuations in foreign      
exchange rates.                                                                 

On the basis of the best information available to the Sponsor at the present    
time, none of the Securities in the Trust are subject to exchange control       
restrictions under existing law which would materially interfere with payment   
to the Trust of dividends due on, or proceeds from the sale of, the             
Securities. However, there can be no assurance that exchange control            
regulations might not be adopted in the future which might adversely affect     
payment to the Trust. The adoption of exchange control regulations and other    
legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of         
international securities in the Trust and on the ability of the Trust to        
satisfy its obligation to redeem Units tendered to the Trustee for redemption.  
In addition, restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the       
purchase or sale side, or both, could cause delays or increase the costs        
associated with the purchase and sale of the foreign Securities and             
correspondingly could affect the price of the Units.                            

Investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all Securities at  
the same time because of the unavailability of any Security, and restrictions   
applicable to the Trust relating to the purchase of a Security by reason of     
the federal securities laws or otherwise.                                       

Foreign securities generally have not been registered under the Securities Act  
of 1933 and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such Act.   
Sales of non-exempt Securities by the Trust in the United States securities     
markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable.          
Accordingly, sales of these Securities by the Trust will generally be effected  
only in foreign securities markets. Although the Sponsor does not believe that  
the Trust will encounter obstacles in disposing of the Securities, investors    
should realize that the Securities may be traded in foreign countries where     
the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may not be as      
liquid as those in the United States. The value of the Securities will be       
adversely affected if trading markets for the Securities are limited or absent. 

Emerging Markets. The following section applies to individual Trusts which      
contain Securities issued by, or invest in securities from certain smaller and  
emerging markets. Compared to more mature markets, some emerging markets may    
have a low level of regulation, enforcement of regulations and monitoring of    
investors' activities. Those activities may include practices such as trading   
on material non-public information. The securities markets of developing        
countries are not as large as the more established securities markets and have  
substantially less trading volume, resulting in a lack of liquidity and high    

Page 11                                                                         

price volatility. There may be a high concentration of market capitalization    
and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number   
of industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial        
intermediaries. These factors may adversely affect the timing and pricing of    
the acquisition or disposal of securities.                                      

In certain emerging markets, registrars are not subject to effective            
government supervision nor are they always independent from issuers. The        
possibility of fraud, negligence, undue influence being exerted by the issuer   
or refusal to recognize ownership exists, which, along with other factors,      
could result in the registration of a shareholding being completely lost.       
Investors should therefore be aware that the Trust could suffer loss arising    
from these registration problems. In addition, the legal remedies in emerging   
markets are often more limited than the remedies available in the United States.

Practices pertaining to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging   
markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in large part     
because of the need to use brokers and counterparties who are less well         
capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be    
unreliable. As a result, brokerage commissions and other fees are generally     
higher in emerging markets and the procedures and rules governing foreign       
transactions and custody may involve delays in payment, delivery or recovery    
of money or investments. Delays in settlement could result in investment        
opportunities being missed if the Trust is unable to acquire or dispose of a    
security. Certain foreign investments may also be less liquid and more          
volatile than U.S. investments, which may mean at times that such investments   
are unable to be sold at desirable prices.                                      

Political and economic structures in emerging markets often change rapidly,     
which may cause instability. In adverse social and political circumstances,     
governments have been involved in policies of expropriation, confiscatory       
taxation, nationalization, intervention in the securities market and trade      
settlement, and imposition of foreign investment restrictions and exchange      
controls, and these could be repeated in the future. In addition to             
withholding taxes on investment income, some governments in emerging markets    
may impose different capital gains taxes on foreign investors. Foreign          
investments may also be subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign            
government and the imposition of restrictions on the exchange or export of      
foreign currency. Additionally, some governments exercise substantial           
influence over the private economic sector and the political and social         
uncertainties that exist for many developing countries are considerable.        

Another risk common to most developing countries is that the economy is         
heavily export oriented and, accordingly, is dependent upon international       
trade. The existence of overburdened infrastructures and obsolete financial     
systems also presents risks in certain countries, as do environmental           
problems. Certain economies also depend, to a large degree, upon exports of     
primary commodities and, therefore, are vulnerable to changes in commodity      
prices which, in turn, may be affected by a variety of factors.                 

Small and/or Mid Capitalization Companies. The following section applies to     
individual Trusts which contain Securities issued by, or invest in Securities   
that hold securities issued by, small and/or mid capitalization companies.      
While historically stocks of small and mid capitalization companies have        
outperformed the stocks of large companies, the former have customarily         
involved more investment risk as well. Such companies may have limited product  
lines, markets or financial resources; may lack management depth or             
experience; and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic    
developments than large companies. Some of these companies may distribute,      
sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be  
dependent on key personnel.                                                     

The prices of small and mid cap company securities are often more volatile      
than prices associated with large company issues, and can display abrupt or     
erratic movements at times, due to limited trading volumes and less publicly    
available information. Also, because such companies normally have fewer shares  
outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies, it     
may be more difficult for the Trusts which contain these Securities to buy and  
sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on        
prevailing market prices.

MEMORANDUM

Re: FT 6460 

     The only difference of consequence (except as described below) between FT
5805 which is the current fund, and FT 6460, the filing of which this memorandum
accompanies, is the change in the series number. The list of securities         
comprising the Fund, the evaluation, record and distribution dates and other    
changes pertaining specifically to the new series, such as size and number of   
Units in the Fund and the statement of condition of the new Fund, will be filed 
by amendment.                                                                   

1940 ACT
FORMS N-8A AND N-8B-2

respect of Templeton Growth and Treasury Trust, Series 1 and subsequent series  
(File No. 811-05903) related also to the subsequent series of the Fund.         

1933 ACT
PROSPECTUS

deposited in the Fund.

Product Features 


	WaterScout SM 100 Soil Moisture Sensors

	The key is knowing both when and how much to water!

	Maintaining a healthy soil moisture and water balance is essential for producing high quality plants. Under-watered plants suffer from nutrient deficiencies, stunting and wilting. Conversely, over-watered plants are more susceptible to disease pressure and less tolerant of dry conditions later on in their life cycle. Extreme over-watering will suffocate the plant and lead to root death.


		Measures Volumetric Water Content (VWC) of soil

		Capacitance-type sensor responds immediately to changes in soil moisture content for better irrigation decisions

		Calibrated for mineral soils or soilless media

		Installs easily into 3/4 in (1.9 cm) hole

		Install permanently or use to take spot measurements

		Can be read with the FieldScout® Soil Sensor Reader (Item 6466) or WatchDog® 2000 and 1000 Series Stations

		Connect up to 8 sensors to one station Not compatible with 400/200 loggers. WatchDog Stations sold prior to 2009 must be upgraded. (call for support)

		NEW Calibration feature: Sensors with "3/14" code can be re-calibrated using the FieldScout Soil Sensor Reader (item 6466) or the WaterScout Calibration Device (item 6470CAL3V). Please see the product manual for calibration proceedure.


	 

	See our Soil Moisture Sensors in action in this video from AgWeb.com - Click here for the video.
