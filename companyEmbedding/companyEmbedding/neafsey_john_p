Constar International Inc. Names John P. Neafsey Chairman of its Board of Directors






April 29, 2004 09:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time



				PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2004--Constar International Inc. (NASDAQ:CNST) today announced that its Board of Directors has elected John P. Neafsey as Chairman of the Company's Board. Charles F. Casey, Constar's former Chairman, will remain as a director of the Company.  Mr. Neafsey has been a member of Constar's Board of Directors since July 2003. 

 Mr. Neafsey, 64, is President of JN Associates, an investment consulting firm. He also serves as Chairman of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., as a Director of West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of National Equipment Services Company. Mr. Neafsey is Trustee Emeritus and Presidential Counselor, Cornell University, and Overseer of Weill-Cornell Medical Center.  Mr. Neafsey previously served as President and CEO of Greenwich Capital Markets from 1990 through 1993 and a Director since its founding in 1983. Earlier in his career Mr. Neafsey was with The Sun Company, now Sunoco, Inc., for 23 years serving in positions of increasing responsibility including Executive Vice President of Canadian operations, the Sun Coal Company and the Helios Capital Corporation; Chief Financial Officer; and other executive positions with numerous subsidiary companies.  "John Neafsey's proven leadership abilities, intelligence, experience and dedication have been great assets to the Company," commented Michael J. Hoffman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We look forward to even greater contributions from him as our Chairman. At the same time, we are grateful for the contributions of Chuck Casey. Chuck came out of retirement to lead our Board at the time of our IPO. Although he chose to step down as Chairman so as to reduce his responsibilities somewhat, we are pleased that he will continue to serve as a Director of the Company."  Mr. Neafsey holds Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in Engineering and a Master of Business Administration degree from Cornell University.
