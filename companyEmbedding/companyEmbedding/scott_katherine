The Effectiveness and Resistance of Common Bactericidal Cleaning Products 
On a daily basis we encounter many harmful and beneficial bacteria that inhabit human environments. Numerous antibacterial cleaning products have been developed to help eliminate household bacteria that can be hazardous to our health. Working with the E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, the effectiveness of common bactericidal cleaning products such as Clorox Clean Up (R) and Antibacterial Windex (R) were analyzed. A substantial component of this research project is to detect the ability of these bacteria to develop a resistance to these products after repeated exposure. Can continued use of these cleaning products make the bacteria more resistant, creating a problematic situation? Does contact time between the bacteria and cleaning products play a role in effectiveness of the products? These are several questions that are addressed by the research of this project.
