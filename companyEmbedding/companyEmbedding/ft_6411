By a Contractor & Engineer
For a plastic shed, I don't think you will find a better product. I wish the plastic was a little thicker, espically in the areas around screw holes, but most held fine-a few stripped. Still a good shed for what it is.  A decent, quick solution to the need for a shed that didn't require a foundation or a building permit.

Excellent quality and fun to build
Product arrived on a long wood pallet. Parts are packaged and marked for identification. A well illustrated instruction sheet is provided. If you have a problem or a missing part, an 800 number is provided. Assembly began in mid-afternoon and was completed the following morning; My son and I did all the work and actually had fun. The finished product is impressive. Within 24 hours after completion we had a heavy rain storm. Happy to report zero leaks! We needed a strong, outdoor gardening shed. This filled the bill.

About This Brand



Kohler - 6411-3-FT 
Add a modern vibe to the kitchen with the crisp design of the Indio sink. The large/medium bowls allow you to keep clean and dirty dishes separate while offering plenty of room for oversize pots and pans. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance. Two bottom basin racks, a colander, and a walnut cutting board are included to fit the sink perfectly and simplify the cooking process.

This attractive plastic garden shed is large enough to store your lawnmower and large garden equipment and also comes with shelving and a pegboard to organize your smaller tools and supplies. With a Lifetime plastic garden shed, you’ll never lose your favorite garden spade again! You’ll appreciate the No Painting, No Rusting design of Lifetime’s plastic garden sheds. Our plastic garden sheds are UV-protected to resist fading and cracking, so they’ll look good as new for many years to come. Constructed from high-density polyethylene plastic with steel reinforcements, they’re built to weather the storms. Lifetime’s plastic garden sheds are a stylish solution to your storage problems. Made in the USA. Covered by a 10 yr. limited factory warranty in US and Canada. Compatible with the 8 ft expansion kits. Consult local building codes before assembly. This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete (not included). It is designed with a slight indentation in each corner of the floor so that you can drill through the flooring to secure it to the foundation. Anchoring hardware depends on the type of foundation you have and is therefore not included in the shed kit. Not including the installation of the foundation, you can expect assembly of the shed itself to take 2 adults up to 6 hours.

Stable and solid. Directions/videos were slightly off from my model but it was 95% accurate and easy to follow. There's extra hardware for most steps, which is nice in one way but will leave you scratching your head sometimes.Took 6 hrs to put together with two people (you'll need two people to put walls, gables and roof on) with only an electric screwdriver and a rubber mallet. Do not do this on a windy day. You'll need a solid, level surface to put this on, the more level, the better the results. One of those projects that you'll be an expert at the end, but you'll never do again!Now it's time to see if it leaks... I think it will and may need to caulk some places.Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsLOVING THIS SHED…IT'S FOR MAMA: STAY OUT ;)Bydon June 5, 2016Size: 8' x 7.5'|Color: Putty/Brown|Verified PurchaseIt's my Mama's Shed for projects and to hide to write my standup material. Not a 'She Shed' exclusively for entertainment, however I just may conduct a workshop for pals & there's a chance of 'beverages breaking out' once they achieve cutting/drilling (& not one minute before…those lushes ;) ).**I do wish they offered something longer on the sides where I could orient it on the large side part of our driveway, but this is a great shed w/a window that opens! Unfortunately, we had to place the door side towards our house wall & that meant you could only add the additional panels on the sides where it wouldn't work for us. :(  (Can't have everything, right?)Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWe built the shedByarrowhead5mson July 30, 2012Size: 8' x 7.5'|Color: Putty/Brown|Verified PurchaseMy husband took his time building the foundation to insure that it was level. It took the two of us two 5 hour day to build the shed. The most difficult part for us was hanging the doors and installing the hardware on the doors. Not too bad for people who make a living pushing pencils around. Shed easily holds our gardening tools & supplies as well as our ice chests. The shed is durable and looks nice. Definitely would purchase this product again.Read more0Comment|

Took a few hours. Could have been done by 2 don't think one person can build it. Followed the instructions carefully but the door has difficulty opening and closing and doesn't line up so we got a padlock to make sure it stays closed because it was opening with strong winds. But it's great and a great size! Holds so much stuff!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood product, bad instructionsByDominic Pazon May 23, 2011Size: 8' x 7.5'|Color: Putty/Brown|Verified PurchaseBought this a week ago, and just spent 5 hours yesterday with my cousin - who builds houses for a living - putting it together.  I'm lucky enough to have every specialty tool known to man, and a good line of cordless power tools, including 1 drill, and 1 driver, so that made putting it together substantially easier.  I would recommend using a drill to do the screws, and a electric driver with a 3/8 socket to put the nuts on (careful not to over-tighten).  You should also have one of those 90 degree angle Phillips screw driver to hold the head of the bolt, while you use the driver on the nut.The directions glaze over a few important details, in particular, which holes to use when connecting the two ends of the trusses together.  If you guess wrong, you will get the roof on, and then notice the final cap pieces don't meet flush, and you will have to tare it all down, rebuild the trusses, and install the roof again.  With 2 men, it is bare-able to get all this together and deal with the curve balls as they come.  There is a video from the manufacturer on youtube which goes over how to build a very similar shed.  Watching that will really help, and will allow you to not need the 70 pages of assembly instructions as much (although you really really need to pay attention to those as well).All and all, the end result is a nice looking, sturdy shed.  I would suggest using caulking to seal up some of the seems to keep out bugs.  I installed mine on top of an existing concrete slab, and used industrial caulking adhesive to glue the shed down.  If you don't have a perfectly flat surface to mount this on, save yourself the heart ache and don't even think about trying this.  The pieces really need to line up perfect in order to assemble right.  I would also discourage anyone from trying to build this with their spouse, unless they want to end their day with a divorce.Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood Shed with Nice FeaturesByJohnon August 7, 2012Size: 8' x 7.5'|Color: Putty/BrownIt took 5 hours for me to assemble the shed.  Overall, it's a good product for the money.  My advice on this project includes:1) I highly recommend downloading the owner's manual first and reading all the assembly instructions.2) As a DIY project, it's a bit of a challenge if you are not mechanically inclined.3) I did the entire job myself and the only part that was a bit of a struggle was to align the front gable end while holding the doors in place.  Honestly, this is the only part of the job that might require two people.4) You should use a cordless drill on a low torque setting.  My drill goes from 1-24 and I found anything more than 10-11 would strip the screws.  Be careful in your settings.5) I only removed one side of the opaque window film to provide a bit more security against anybody looking inside.  It still provides plenty of light inside.6) To align the doors, I would use roofing shingles as your shims under the floor instead of the wood.Good luck.  I think the end result is worth it.Read more0Comment|

I do have to adjust the doors. The floor is plastic instead of rubber . The skylights are not a clear plastic like the window so it is a little dark inside. Wish they were clear to let in more light but it is very nice looking and seems really sturdy.Read more0Comment|
