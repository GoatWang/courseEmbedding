Date: September 16, 2013


CLEVELAND … Power management company Eaton today announced Ken Semelsberger has been appointed senior vice president and controller effective November 1, 2013. Semelsberger succeeds Billie Rawot who will retire October 31, 2013 after 36 years of service with Eaton. Semelsberger will report to Richard Fearon, vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer.“Ken has held several important finance roles during his long tenure at Eaton,” said Fearon. “In each of those roles he has made a tremendous contribution to the growth and progress of Eaton. I look forward to working with Ken in his new role as our controller.”Semelsberger joined Eaton in 1988, and most recently served as senior vice president of Finance and Planning for the Industrial Sector. Prior to that, he held the positions of senior vice president, Corporate Development and Treasury; vice president, Strategic Planning; and director, Corporate Development. Prior to joining Eaton, Semelsberger was a consultant for Coopers & Lybrand.Semelsberger holds a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing and international business from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in Massachusetts.Rawot was named vice president and controller in 1991, and promoted to senior vice president and controller in 2008. Since joining Eaton in 1977, she also served as the assistant controller, Financial Accounting. Prior to joining the company, she served as a senior auditor with Ernst & Young and a senior auditor with Deloitte & Touche. Rawot holds a bachelor’s degree in accountancy from the University of Illinois, Champaign, and is a certified public accountant.“In her role as chief accounting officer, Billie has been a key contributor to Eaton’s growth and success. She has been a champion for continuous improvement at Eaton and a significant asset to the Cleveland community, lending her leadership skills to educational and social service organizations such as the Great Lakes Science Center, the YWCA and the United Way,” said Fearon. “Speaking for Eaton’s entire leadership team, I want to thank Billie for her leadership and enthusiasm and wish her well in her retirement.”Eaton is a power management company providing energy-efficient solutions that help our customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power. A global technology leader, Eaton acquired Cooper Industries plc in November 2012. The 2012 revenue of the combined companies was $21.8 billion on a pro forma basis.
