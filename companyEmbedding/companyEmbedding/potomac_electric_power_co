Key 2014 accomplishments include:

Providing incentives for more than 500 homes, bringing the program total to 951. Market share for ENERGY STAR certified homes in the Pepco service territory is now close to 40 percent, and Pepco provides extensive training to builders, raters, and other partners to meet stringent Version 3.1 requirements.
Incorporating ENERGY STAR messaging into consumer campaigns using Facebook, web banners, Google AdWords, newspaper advertisements, and print inserts showcasing all of Pepco’s programs that delivered 4.8 million impressions for the year.
Facilitating the sale of more than 12,000 ENERGY STAR certified appliances and 1.6 million ENERGY STAR certified lighting products—an 11-percent increase in bulb sales compared to the same time period in 2013—resulting in annual savings of more than 75,500 megawatt hours.
Encouraging customers to participate and take advantage of a wide range of energy-saving programs and purchase ENERGY STAR certified products: appliances, high-efficiency cooling and heating systems, as well as compact fluorescent light (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs. The ENERGY STAR logo was seen in free-standing inserts, newspaper ads, direct mail, utility bill inserts, Facebook ads, Google ads, radio ads, email, rich media mobile ads and web banners.
Collaborating with other Maryland utilities and industry stakeholders to advance the EmPower Maryland Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program.

History[edit]




The Pepco headquarters in Washington, D.C., in May 2010.


Pepco, an acronym of Potomac Electric Power Company, was founded in the late 19th century as a subsidiary of the Washington Traction and Electric Company, one of the private streetcar companies in Washington. Surplus power was then sold to other electric streetcar companies and to cable car companies so that they could convert to electricity. Later, the power was sold to business and residential customers.
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 forced the North American Company, the holding company, to divest itself of either their streetcar operations or their power generating utility.[3] As power generation was far more profitable, North American choose to divest itself of the transport entity.
In 2001, the company was reorganized and became a unit of Pepco Holdings, Inc.
Transmission system[edit]
Pepco's bulk transmission system consists of transmission lines operating at 115 kV, 138kV, 230 kV and 500 kV. Pepco has interconnections with Potomac Edison (230kV, 500kV), Baltimore Gas and Electric (500kV, 230kV, 115kV), and Dominion Virginia Power (500kV, 230kV).
Mergers[edit]
In April 2014 Pepco Holdings Inc. (PHI), Washington, D.C.-based parent company of Atlantic City Electric, Delmarva Power, and Pepco[4] announced a $6.8 billion merger with Exelon, a Chicago-based utility company. A December 18, 2014 article in The Washington Post highlighted opposition by the public to the merger with Exelon, arguing that it would not be in the best interest of consumers, that it was likely to result in higher prices to District of Columbia Pepco customers and even worse reliability.[5]
The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators.[6] On March 23, 2016, the Commission finally approved the merger.[7] The merger with Exelon was completed on that same day.
Energy efficient rebate programs[edit]
From 2012 to 2014 Pepco offered rebate programs for residential and commercial customers looking to save energy by upgrading to energy efficient equipment and systems. Incentives helped to offset the initial capital cost of upgrading equipment.
Controversy[edit]
An investigation by The Washington Post in 2010 faulted Pepco for poor reliability. The report noted that the company's performance had slipped since 2005, comparing poorly to other major utilities in the frequency and duration of power outages. Thousands of people lost power for as many as five days after only 5-8 inches of heavy wet snow.[8]
In 2011, Business Insider named the company first on its list of "The 19 Most Hated Companies In America" based on its American Customer Satisfaction Index rating.[9]
During the severe June 29, 2012 derecho, more than half of the customers in Montgomery County, Maryland lost electric power. Restoration rates severely lagged behind those of neighboring power companies that were equally impacted by the storm.[citation needed] Pepco was unable to restore power for thousands of customers for a week. In nearby Fairfax County, Virginia, Dominion Power restored power to most customers within 36 hours.[citation needed] In the June 2012 derecho, over 200,000 Pepco customers lost power, and some were not restored for 8 days.[10] Pepco charged customers a surcharge for the time they were without power and their meters were not running an administrative fee, amounting to $0.50 per customer.[11]

(PHI), Washington, D.C.-based parent company of Atlantic City Electric, Delmarva Power, and Pepco[4] announced a $6.8 billion merger with Exelon, a Chicago-based utility company. A December 18, 2014 article in The Washington Post highlighted opposition by the public to the merger with Exelon, arguing that it would not be in the best interest of consumers, that it was likely to result in higher prices to District of Columbia Pepco customers and even worse reliability.[5]
The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators.[6] On March 23, 2016, the Commission finally approved the merger.[7] The merger with Exelon was completed on that same day.
Energy efficient rebate programs[edit]
From 2012 to 2014 Pepco offered rebate programs for residential and commercial customers looking to save energy by upgrading to energy efficient equipment and systems. Incentives helped to offset the initial capital cost of upgrading equipment.
Controversy[edit]
An investigation by The Washington Post in 2010 faulted Pepco for poor reliability. The report noted that the company's performance had slipped since 2005, comparing poorly to other major utilities in the frequency and duration of power outages. Thousands of people lost power for as many as five days after only 5-8 inches of heavy wet snow.[8]
In 2011, Business Insider named the company first on its list of "The 19 Most Hated Companies In America" based on its American Customer Satisfaction Index rating.[9]
During the severe June 29, 2012 derecho, more than half of the customers in Montgomery County, Maryland lost electric power. Restoration rates severely lagged behind those of neighboring power companies that were equally impacted by the storm.[citation needed] Pepco was unable to restore power for thousands of customers for a week. In nearby Fairfax County, Virginia, Dominion Power restored power to most customers within 36 hours.[citation needed] In the June 2012 derecho, over 200,000 Pepco customers lost power, and some were not restored for 8 days.[10] Pepco charged customers a surcharge for the time they were without power and their meters were not running an administrative fee, amounting to $0.50 per customer.[11]

The company's current trademarked slogan is "Your life. Plugged in." Its former slogan was "We're connected to you by more than power lines."

History[edit]




The Pepco headquarters in Washington, D.C., in May 2010.


Pepco, an acronym of Potomac Electric Power Company, was founded in the late 19th century as a subsidiary of the Washington Traction and Electric Company, one of the private streetcar companies in Washington. Surplus power was then sold to other electric streetcar companies and to cable car companies so that they could convert to electricity. Later, the power was sold to business and residential customers.
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 forced the North American Company, the holding company, to divest itself of either their streetcar operations or their power generating utility.[3] As power generation was far more profitable, North American choose to divest itself of the transport entity.
In 2001, the company was reorganized and became a unit of Pepco Holdings, Inc.
Transmission system[edit]
Pepco's bulk transmission system consists of transmission lines operating at 115 kV, 138kV, 230 kV and 500 kV. Pepco has interconnections with Potomac Edison (230kV, 500kV), Baltimore Gas and Electric (500kV, 230kV, 115kV), and Dominion Virginia Power (500kV, 230kV).
Mergers[edit]
In April 2014 Pepco Holdings Inc. (PHI), Washington, D.C.-based parent company of Atlantic City Electric, Delmarva Power, and Pepco[4] announced a $6.8 billion merger with Exelon, a Chicago-based utility company.

The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators.[6] On March 23, 2016, the Commission finally approved the merger.[7] The merger with Exelon was completed on that same day.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 10/19/1931
            

                BBB has determined that Potomac Electric Power Co. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
