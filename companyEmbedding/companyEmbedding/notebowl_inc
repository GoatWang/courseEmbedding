Help Students SucceedDrive Engagement in class and on campusScroll to learn more


















































 Schools succeed when their students succeed. That means high retention rates, quality education, and great career placement.Notebowl drives classroom engagement and fosters community involvement, creating better outcomes for universities and students alike.  







Create Learning CommunitiesIntuitive, social design connects students and instructors. Promote after-class discussion, make it easy to ask questions and give answers that everyone will see. Keep your students up to date on assignments, test, and grades.







Make Real connectionsStudents are more likely to get involved when it's easy to find out what's going on. Simple group tools allow students and faculty to create groups for academic or community purposes, see group activity, and join in on all the existing clubs, organizations, and departments.







Keep in ContactLet's be honest, email doesn't work well for students. What does work? Notifications. Combined with a newsfeed to bring together all the interactions from classes, groups, and the school at large, you get a highly engaged and well-informed student body. 










ClassroomMore Learning, Less Management



Drive student engagement with social tools Like a classroom, Notebowl is inherently social. It’s designed to naturally extend class discussions online. Questions are easily answered in a place that everyone can see, while comments, likes, and sharing encourage participation.  











Always up to Date
Communicate like you mean it with your students. Have them share their thoughts organically, ask questions, share files and images all in one location. Now you have an exciting place to extend class to an online space.



 











Assignments
Put your homework, tests, quizzes and any action item for your class in a digital syllabus organized by dates. Connected to your calendar and all classes sync together. Making it easy for students to stay on top of all work and keep it nice and tidy for management.



 











Generate Discussion
Student-friendly discussion boards drive interaction with familiar social features like comments and profile pictures. Our quick grader makes it a breeze to evaluate assigned discussions.



 What faculty are saying











“The clean and intuitive organization that Notebowl introduced is great. Clearly the developers are focused on the specific needs of students and faculty." 
Mallorie Leinenger, Denison University















“My students that take advantage of the synchronous learning environment that Notebowl allows are more engaged in my classes and earn higher grades than those that aren’t.” 
Bryan Carter, University of Arizona















“My experience with Notebowl has been fantastic. I’ve really enjoyed how it seamlessly blends the functionality of course communication and course management"
Ashwin Lall, Denison University



 It's all about community in your classes. See for yourself.










GroupsIMPROVE DISCOVERY & PARTICIPATION



Get students involved with campus life Involvement in campus groups and activities provides key support for students in school, and builds valuable connections that will help them down the road.  











Simplify Discovery
Letting students know about activities and events is a real challenge -  just look at all those flyers everywhere. Notebowl makes it easy for students to see what’s happening on campus.















Easy Organization
Let your community collaborate in groups for classes, social activities, events, clubs, organizations, departments, student services and more. Share information, files, or even jump on a video call.















Clubs, Organizations & Services
From departments to study groups, Notebowl provides a place for every organization. And it’s easy for students to filter and find groups based on their personal preferences, making it more likely they’ll find something they connect with.














News FeedEngaging by Design



Social tools for a social environment Notebowl harnesses the power of familiar social tools to keep students engaged with the entire campus experience from classes to sporting events.  Never Miss OutWhile they might gloss over emails or paper packets, the Newsfeed allows students to quickly scan all the updates from their classes and communities, helping them to stay informed.







 Highly Visible AnnouncementsFaculty, administrators, and other leaders can communicate directly with students by posting announcements that students will actually see. Comment and sharing options allow even more engagement.







 Anonymous QuestionsHelp shy or embarrassed students get answers by asking anonymous public questions - Instructors know who asked, but class members won’t.


















Get StartedReady When You Are



Easy options to start helping students Notebowl can integrate with your current learning management system (LMS), or Notebowl can fully replace it and stand on its own.  











Notebowl Standalone
Replace your current system with Notebowl's social learning platform which includes a full-featured LMS with all of the management controls, teaching tools, security, and certifications that you expect.

Our StoryThe world of higher education is changing.



Students are more concerned today about costs, and the real value of the education they’re receiving. Online alternatives and skill focused training programs are popping up everywhere, leading prospective students to ask, is college worth it?Our answer to that question is yes. College is incredibly important. We built Notebowl to help keep it that way.During our college experience, we saw the need to improve systems that were being used to manage the classroom experience, and connect students to campus life. Notebowl makes college more valuable by improving classroom experience, building community, enabling greater access to university network and connections, and opening up more career related opportunities.










Our TeamThe best and brightest



TeamThe individuals behind making the Notebowl dream come to life. So much heart goes into the development of the product and the implementation into universities and schools around the country. The best and brightest are at work to help move our world forward.

Summit Reflections can only be completed onsite at the event; reviewers are incentivized to leave reviews.Student, School Type: Higher Education  — AdvocateUsage: It's like FB for students, so I would create a student community and encourage continual posting, discussion, and grade checking for my classroom.Strengths: Product is well integrated with how students currently use technology -- it's a seamless transistion to their current use.
Suggestions for Improvement: 1) Talk about the integration with Google Docs more 
2) Create a tutorial for teachers not familiar with FB's interface already to familiarize themselves
3) Help with course managementVerdict: Learning platforms such as these require network effects to be useful--like ALL OR NOTHING value, so you would need the whole school (if not the whole district) to adopt it to be helpful for students to get information on their courses for.Jan 28, 2017          Educator, School Type: Other  — AdvocateUsage: share data with other studentsStrengths: great mutual learning tool.  Social media site for learning. I like the encryption and PCI compliance features.  This is so important these days with so many things getting out on the internet that were not intended.Suggestions for Improvement: it would be good to have a facebook feed included with the interface.  I understand this probably voids the PCI compliance but perhaps some way to access in an isolated window might work.   A place that lists important Test details along with (count down timer to test date etc.) would be good.    Like when the test is due the timer turns bright red and starts flashing.Verdict: great tool for students to collaborate and learn better both during school and after hours.Jan 28, 2017          Andrew, Staff Development Specialist. School Type: Elementary School, Middle School, High School, Other, High ELL Population, Low Income Population, Project Based School, College Prep School, 1:1 Devices, BYOD Devices, Blended Learning  — AdvocateUsage: I work with teachers in special education.

Strengths: I like the idea of students reviewing each others work, however I'm not sure all students are mature enough to handle this program. Suggestions for Improvement: I like that it is similar to Facebook, however Facebook is considered outdated for most students. I don't think younger students would get everything out of this. Verdict: I feel this is good for higher level grades or ability students. Jan 28, 2017          Teacher, School Type: Middle School, High ELL Population, 1:1 Devices, Blended Learning  — AdvocateUsage: At my school we belong to teams. I have a math, language arts, and history teacher on my team and i would use this product for all of use to communicate with each other and with our group of about 150 students. Strengths: I like that it is like a social media site but for educational purposes.  I like that there can be multiple owners which would work well for my team as there are four of us.  This product would allow for my team and i to all be aware as what is going on in each others classrooms.  Suggestions for Improvement: I liked what i saw so for now i do not have any suggestions for improvements.Verdict: I would recommend this product in that it is like social media platform for teachers and students but at the same time it is for educational purposes.

Jan 29, 2017          Recruiter, School Type: Middle School, High School, High ELL Population, Low Income Population  — AdvocateStrengths: i think it's very user friendly and is similar to other social media websites. there are many components to it such as speaking about assignments, students helping one another and many other featuresSuggestions for Improvement: visual appeal because it looks very similar to facebook. though it is unique and easy to use, the look is rather basic and resembles facebookVerdict: i would let them know that it's a one stop shop for communicating with students and can increase engagementJan 28, 2017          Teacher, School Type: High School  — AdvocateUsage: It is very student- centered, and can motivate students to learn and involve in.Strengths: It can make both teachers and students time easier, such as, if some kids missed the class, they  don' t need to come over to me for make-up assignment.
