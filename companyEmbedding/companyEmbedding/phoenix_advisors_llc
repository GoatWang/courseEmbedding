Public focus.
Government centric.


Municipal, County and State governments need to meet specific requirements in process, and uphold responsibility to the people they serve. Phoenix Advisors is well versed in the difficulties of helping governments meet their financial objectives while accomplishing their goals. Through debt restructuring, budget management or the variety of other financial advising, Phoenix helps keep Government productive and fiscally responsible.
 
Infrastructure:
Phoenix Advisors has guided some of the Northeast's largest metropolitan regions, as well as many cities and towns, in structuring and issuing debt, and managing budgets that help infrastructure meet demand. Whether it's new facilities or updating roads, bridges, water and sewer, Phoenix has the expertise to make sure you travel the best possible path.
 
Improvements:
In today's financial and political climate, many improvements can seem daunting. Phoenix Advisors approaches every situation with an understanding of the value to the community with projects such as playgrounds or senior centers. And Phoenix has proven time and again that it is possible, even today, to manage budget and financing to create opportunities that improve quality of life.
 
Refinancing:
Low interest rates create the opportunity for governments to re-fund old debt. By issuing new debt at lower interest rates, significant and always welcome savings can be realized in debt service.
 
Redevelopment:
Community development happens with the right mix of human spirit, a broad vision, and the financial path to bring it together. Financing options, especially today, can be limited. But Phoenix Advisors has successfully guided developers and commuinties to the debt issuance and terms that they can comfortably live with. And at the same time, thousands of people have a special place to call home that otherwise may not have been possible.

Interest rates are leaving the station.And the next ride isn't going to be so smooth.
The currently low interest rates on long-term bonds present a welcome opportunity for municipalities and counties to lock in their debt service. But interest rates are on track to increase. While one year notes were a good vehicle in the past, now is the time to make sure you don’t get left behind.
For advice about accessing long-term financing, contact a Phoenix Advisors professional at 609-291-0130, or phoenix@muniadvisors.com.

Accelerating Profitable Growth RENEW / PREDICT / MEASURE 





Renew The best growth strategies are continually reevaluated and refreshed. 





Predict Successful growth strategies are based on objective evaluation. 





Measure Rigorous reflection is critical to success. 













 




Renew
Change is the only constant in life. We need to embrace change to improve performance, introduce new products/offerings, or move in new directions. Phoenix Strategic Advisors has expertise and methodologies designed to leverage and optimize change to your advantage.



Predict
Once an arrow has been released, you have little control over its direction. Thus aiming is imperative. Phoenix Strategic Advisors' frameworks help ensure the success of new marketing campaigns, potential acquisitions, new products/offerings, and other growth strategies.



Measure
In order to know if something is working well, you need to measure it using appropriate metrics. At Phoenix Strategic Advisors, we fundamentally believe in the use of fact-based measures. We use Best Practice methods to understand, plan, and implement strategic initiatives.
