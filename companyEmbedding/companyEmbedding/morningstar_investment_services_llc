Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

                            Director, Global ETF Research and Editor
                         
Morningstar ETFInvestor scans the globe for value and improving fundamentals across virtually all asset classes. Editor Ben Johnson draws upon academic and practitioner research--including Morningstar's sizeable bench of stock, bond and fund analysts—to find reliable drivers of outperformance.
                         








Objective 
Morningstar ETFInvestor features two real-money portfolios.
                    

                        The ETF Income Portfolio assembles a high-quality collection of income-generating ETFs with the goal of earning 5% in excess of the 30-day T-bill rate over a full business cycle. The portfolio adheres to a benchmark-agnostic strategy in its search for absolute returns.
                    


                        The ETF Global Asset Allocation Portfolio, on the other hand, is more benchmark sensitive. It seeks undervalued asset classes with improving fundamentals. The strategy seeks to beat the 60/40 MSCI ACWI/Barclays US Aggregate benchmark over a full business cycle, with the least risk possible.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Tortoise Portfolio. The objective of Morningstar, Inc.’s Tortoise Portfolio is
            to focus on “high-quality” businesses, defined as having both durable competitive
            advantages and strong balance sheets. These are often well-established market leaders
            with economic moats (preferably wide). Morningstar’s aim for the portfolio is to
            generate risk-adjusted returns that outperform the S&P 500 over a full market cycle.
            
Hare Portfolio. The objective of Morningstar, Inc.’s Hare Portfolio is to
                seek long-term capital appreciation ahead of the S&P 500 Index, focusing on companies
                with strong and growing competitive advantages. Morningstar is willing for the Hare
                to accept greater risk in exchange for higher total return potential.

 Roundup 7/21/2017 -- A New Fair Value Estimate for Berkshire, Earnings UpdatesStockInvestorSM focuses on the activities of portfolios of Morningstar, Inc. that are invested in accordance with the Tortoise and Hare strategies. These portfolios are managed by Morningstar Investment Management LLC, a registered investment adviser, which manages other client portfolios using these strategies.
Please see new Morningstar analyst notes below for American Express AXP, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK (two separate notes -- one addressing the announced CEO change and other discussing earnings), Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, BlackRock BLK, eBay EBAY, Novartis NVS, Unilever UL, and Visa V. Several Tortoise and Hare portfolio holdings were also tagged in a general note about efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Best wishes,David Harrell,Editor, Morningstar StockInvestorAmex's Renewed Focus on Growth is Encouraging, but Competition Remains Intenseby Jim Sinegal | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-19-17We like that wide-moat American Express is turning its attention back toward revenue growth after the loss of a major client in 2016 and a period of emphasis on cost-cutting. A renewed emphasis on corporate spending, especially with small- and medium-size businesses, appears to be paying off. Additionally, a strengthening global economy is providing a tailwind for spending growth. However, evidence of an intense competitive environment continues to show up in results, and the company's plans to further differentiate its rewards offerings lack specifics. We are maintaining our $88 per share fair value estimate.The competitive environment in the consumer space remains intense. Excluding the effects of last year's Costco business loss, total revenue expanded 8%, but rewards spending grew by 19% on the same basis. Card member services spending expanded by 24%. We think this indicates American Express is having to pass on a larger share of discount revenue to customers in order to maintain market share. Furthermore, though discount revenue as a percentage of billed business was stable during the quarter, American Express is passing on some economic benefits to merchants and acquirers through its OptBlue program. We see few signs that pressure from merchants and cardholders will let up any time soon.American Express remains a payment method of choice for both large and small businesses, and the company's efforts to grow in this area are likely to pay off.  Although large companies are continuing to cut back on travel and entertainment expenses, American Express' global commercial business generated mid-single-digit billed business growth, driven primarily by small business volume. Business-to-business spending represents a multitrillion dollar opportunity, and we believe American Express benefits from high switching costs and a powerful brand asset in this arena.American Express' online banking efforts are continuing to bear fruit. Management indicated that the company has passed on only about 25% of rate increases to savings account customers, and we don't expect competition to heat up any time soon. We doubt that many consumers will be inclined to lock in low rates until rates provide significantly higher nominal returns, and few banks seem desperate for deposit funds at the moment.American Express' lending business is also performing well. Charge-offs remain very low--the company wrote off only 1.8% of loans during the quarter, and balances grew at a healthy 11% annualized rate during the quarter. We don't see any evidence that the company is chasing low-quality balances, and expect credit losses to remain manageable in a downturn. That said, losses are sure to increase over time as the portfolio seasons.Marketing and promotion expenses grew by just 5% during the year as American Express turned its customer acquisition efforts to the digital realm, and other operating expenses fell by 4% on an adjusted basis over the same time period. We expect a renewed emphasis on expense control, combined with moderate growth in billed business and significant capital return, to result in healthy earnings per share growth over our five-year forecast period. BNY Mellon's Surprise CEO Change Raises Questions About the Firm's Directionby Greggory Warren, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-17-17We were a bit surprised by today's announcement from wide-moat-rated BNY Mellon that chairman and CEO Gerald Hassell would be relinquishing his chief executive post immediately, and would also step down from his role as chairman at the end of the year, mainly because it wasn't clearly telegraphed to investors. That said, the choice of Charles Scharf, former CEO of wide-moat-rated Visa (with previous banking experience at Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase), to replace Hassell as CEO (and chairman at the end of the year) seems to be a solid choice for a firm that has been pressured by activist investors the past several years to cut costs and improve top-line growth, which has proved difficult to pull off in an environment of historically low interest rates. Hassell had planned to retire once the firm showed progress on a series of goals that were put forth by the firm in 2014, some of which were met last year. However, we had no indication that a management change was in the works. We expect to hear more from the firm (and to ask it plenty of questions) when BNY Mellon reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but would expect Scharf to be given at least six months to go through the business and put together a new strategy for the bank. That said, we're not big fans of past calls from some activist investors for BNY Mellon to spin off or sell its asset-management business, which had $1.7 trillion in AUM at the end of March 2017, making it one of the largest U.S.-based asset managers. This is a moaty business albeit not as moaty as its trust/custody operations. That said, it has served as a bit of a buffer for the firm during the past decade, offsetting some of the impact of historically low interest rates, and has provided some avenues for growth, especially internationally. We do not expect to make a change to our $49 per share fair value estimate for BNY Mellon as a result of the company's management change.Solid Net Interest Margin and AUM Gains Lift BNY Mellon's First-Half Results; Raising FVE to $53by Greggory Warren, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-20-17While there was little in wide-moat-rated BNY Mellon's second-quarter results that would alter our long-term view of the firm, we have increased our fair value estimate to $53 per share from $49 to reflect a greater increase in near-term net interest margin improvements, as well as assets under management, than we forecast previously. The company's second-quarter net interest margin of 1.14% was a large improvement over the prior-year period (0.97%) and a slight shift upwards from the first quarter (1.13%). We're now forecasting full-year results closer to the upper end (rather than the lower end) of our 1.10%-1.15% forecast range for the year.Assets under custody/administration increased 1.6% sequentially and 5.4% year over year to $31.1 trillion. BNY Mellon had $1.8 trillion directly under management at the end of the second quarter, up 2.5% sequentially and 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Shifting product mix, ongoing fee compression and changes in currency left investment management and performance fee revenue up 5.9% year over year (and 4.8% for the first half of 2017 when compared with the prior-year period). Total second-quarter (and first half) revenue increased 4.8% (3.9%) to $4.0 ($7.8) billion. Effective cost controls once again led to a low-single-digit increase in noninterest expenses during the period, allowing the firm to leverage ongoing share repurchases and post a 12.2% increase in second-quarter earnings to $0.88 per share.BNY Mellon remains fairly well capitalized, with management committed to returning capital to shareholders. The bank's fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of June was 10.4%, up from the first quarter (10.0%) and beginning of the year (9.7%). The firm also recently announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share from $0.19, which would imply a dividend yield of 1.8%. Through the first six months of 2017, BNY Mellon repurchased more than 13 million shares for around $734 million.Berkshire Puts Growing Cash Hoard to Work; FVE Raisedby Greggory Warren, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-17-17 We've increased our fair value estimate for Berkshire Hathaway's Class A (B) shares to $290,000 ($193) from $280,000 ($187) to reflect changes in our assumptions about revenue, investment returns, and profitability since our last update. This fair value estimate change includes the impact of recent investments in Oakwood Homes, Store Capital, and Home Capital Group, Berkshire's exercise of its warrants to acquire 700 million shares of Bank of America's common stock, and the bid for Oncor Electric Delivery. It does not include the rumored $10 billion-plus investment Sprint reportedly solicited from Warren Buffett this past week, which we believe Berkshire would be willing to do at the right price (it has more than enough dry powder on hand). Our new fair value estimate is equivalent to 1.5 and 1.4 times our projected book value per share estimates for 2017 and 2018, respectively.We use a sum-of-the-parts methodology to derive our fair value estimate. Our valuation for Berkshire's insurance operations increased 5% to $97,400 ($64) per Class A (B) share, primarily due to changes in market expectations for the investment portfolio. Our value for Kraft Heinz, which we value separately from the insurance operations, remains at $14,800 ($10) per Class A (B) share. While our estimate for BNSF increased 3% to $61,200 ($41) per Class A (B) share on slightly better coal volume through the first half of the year, we've lowered our valuation for Berkshire Hathaway Energy slightly to $25,400 ($17) per Class A (B) share, given the dilution from the Oncor bid. Our fair value estimate for Berkshire's manufacturing, service, and retail operations increased 3% to $82,000 ($55) per Class A (B) share, and we also made a slight increase in our value for the firm's finance and financial products division to $9,200 ($6) per Class A share after raising our long-term expectations and incorporating the Oakwood Homes and Home Capital Group deals into the segment.Looking more closely at Berkshire's insurance operations, we've kept our underwriting forecasts for each of the firm's four subsidiaries--Geico, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, or BHRG, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, or BHPG--in place, but have projected a slightly higher yield on the segment's investment portfolio (as interest rates increase over time). We’re also projecting stronger investment returns for the segment this year than we were projecting in our previous forecast. The net result is a 5% increase in our value for the insurance operations to $97,400 ($64) per Class A (B) share from $92,400 ($62) per Class A (B) share. We continue to be concerned with Geico's relentless pursuit of growth, given that it has come at the expense of profitability the past several years. The auto insurer's earned premium growth of 13.3% during the fourth quarter of 2016 was one of the strongest quarterly results Geico has ever put up, with management accelerating underwriting activity as its peers pulled back from the market in response to spiking loss ratios (driven by increases in both frequency and severity of claims). Geico continued to hit the gas pedal in the first quarter of 2017, generating earned premium growth of 13.1%. We don't expect the firm to maintain such an elevated rate of growth as we move forward, seeing earned premium growth averaging between 11%-12% during 2017-21--slightly above the 10.7% and 8.7% CAGRs that Geico generated during 2012-16 and 2007-16, respectively.Geico's average loss ratio of 82.6% the past twelve calendar quarters was worse than the 78.7% average level seen during 2012-16 and the 77.0% level seen during 2007-16. That said, underwriting expenses continue to track down as the ever-increasing size and scale of Geico's business has allowed the auto insurer to generate an average expense ratio of 15.5% the past twelve calendar quarters, better than the 17.0% level seen during 2012-16 and the 17.5% level seen during 2007-16. Even so, the firm's overall combined ratio of 98.1% during the past three years puts profitability at levels not seen since 1999-2000. Going forward, we expect Geico's combined ratio to improve only marginally during the next five years, from 98.3% this year to 97.1% in 2021. As for Berkshire's two reinsurance arms--General Re and BHRG--we're not expecting much in the way of growth, given that the industry continues to struggle with a weak pricing environment driven by excess capacity that has been driven by the entrance of new players (including hedge funds), as well as the growth of alternative capital (such as catastrophe bonds) and the lack of large-scale catastrophes (which makes it harder for reinsurers to justify raising their rates). While the firm expects reinsurance to be an unattractive business for at least the next decade, General Re and BHRG (unlike many of their peers) have the luxury of walking away from reinsurance underwriting when an appropriate premium cannot be obtained, with both firms showing no real inclination to pursue growth in the current pricing environment.Given the pricing environment that reinsurers continue to face, we believe firms with more diverse insurance portfolios, and that serve multiple distribution channels, are much more likely to offset the negatives in the market, and should be able to target profitable opportunities as they arise. We feel that both General Re and BHRG fall into this category. That said, Berkshire's reinsurance operations are still dealing with a number of run-off contracts, so we expect the ability of the two firms to generate float (aside from one-off transactions like the AIG deal done earlier this year) to be limited. With more than two thirds of Berkshire's overall float coming from its two reinsurance arms--General Re (16%) and BHRG (52%)--we believe that further increases in the overall level of the company's insurance float (which stood at around $105 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2017) will be more difficult to come by. For General Re, we continue to forecast low-single-digit annual declines in earned premiums during 2017-21, with expectations for an average combined ratio of 97.6% over the next five years. As for BHRG, we're not expecting much premium growth during the next five years, but do recognize that the more recent deal with AIG will lift earned premium growth into positive territory (from what continues to be a projection for low-single-digit annual declines in earned premiums during 2017-21). We also expect the firm to generate an average combined ratio of 99.2% over the next five years. In an environment where the two reinsurers are intentionally reducing underwriting (given that pricing is inadequate relative to the risk), about the best we can hope for is tight enough expense controls (and a lack of extremely adverse events), allowing both firms to keep their combined ratios below the 100% mark.
As for the investment portfolio attached to the insurance operations (which includes not only the equity and fixed-income portfolios but the firm's cash balances), we are now projecting a 7%-8% annual increase in the overall value of these assets (which includes both market gains and additions to the portfolio), due primarily to mark-to-market changes made to the portfolio after a strong first half showing. Following the exercise of Berkshire's warrants to acquire 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock for $7.14 per share (which was paid for by exchanging the $5 billion 6% preferred stock Berkshire held in the bank), Berkshire became Bank of America's largest shareholder (outside of the major index-based products providers like Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock), with the bank becoming a top 5 stock investment holding for the firm. While the investment in Store Capital, a triple-net lease REIT, was much smaller at $377 million, Berkshire now holds a nearly 10% stake in the firm. Looking more closely at Kraft Heinz, which we value separately from the insurance operations (despite being held on their books), our fair value estimate remains at $14,800 ($10) per Class A (B) share. With respect to Berkshire's other non-insurance operations, we've increased our fair value estimate for BNSF 3% to $61,200 ($41) per Class A (B) share on slightly better coal volumes through the first half of the year. Our new forecast has total unit volumes increasing at a 2.3% CAGR during the next five calendar years (up from 2.1% previously). While this is slightly higher than the 0.6% CAGR we saw during 2012-16, much of the improvement is coming from a quicker recovery in coal shipments (which were down 21.1% during 2016). We also envision pricing being slightly more robust overall for BNSF, with revenue per unit increasing at a 2.4% CAGR during 2017-21. We continue to expect pricing gains achieved during the next five years to outpace rail cost inflation, which should contribute to ongoing improvements in profitability. We believe that BNSF's operating ratio will improve from 66.3% during 2016 to 58.0% by the end of our five-year forecast period, putting the railroad's profitability more on par with its most comparable peer, Union Pacific, which we have projected to have a 56.0% operating ratio by the end of 2021.We've reduced our fair value estimate for the insurer's 90% stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy to $25,400 ($17) per Class A (B) share from $25,500 ($17), after incorporating the firm's purchase of Energy Future Holdings 80% equity stake in Oncor Electric Delivery (which we give a 50% chance of being closed before the end of 2017) into our model. The dilutive impact of the deal would have been greater had it not been for the buffer created by time value of money considerations. We still believe that the deal, which values Oncor at 26 times trailing earnings and 1.5 times (3.1 times goodwill adjusted) book value, to be a bit on the rich side, given that the median P/E multiple for our U.S. coverage is about 21 times trailing earnings, and the average P/B multiple for utilities is about 2.0 times in today's market. That said, the entry of Paul Singer and his hedge fund firm, Elliott Management, into the bidding process has lowered our overall confidence in the deal being completed, primarily because Buffett and Berkshire do not partake in bidding wars. However, BHE's announcement discussions with the Texas regulators regarding Oncor’s independence and financial integrity, as well as long-term investments in infrastructure and security, should still give it a leg up in bankruptcy court (even though Singer's hedge fund firm holds the majority of the EFH's debt).Going forward, we continue to expect BHE's U.S. regulated utilities--PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, and NV Energy--to continue to receive constructive rate-case outcomes and earn somewhere close to their current allowable returns on equity. This would leave annual EBITDA growth for these businesses in the 5%-6% range over the next five years. For Northern Powergrid, we expect ongoing price reviews to allow the firm to generate mid-single-digit annual EBITDA growth over the next five years. This is slightly higher than the rate of growth we are expecting for the firm's pipeline and renewables businesses, which assumes the near-term prospects for additional renewables projects coming on line will be limited due to the expiration of federal tax credits. Our fair value estimate for Berkshire's regulated utilities is also equivalent to 5.7 times our 2017 EBITDA estimate, putting it in line with our valuations for similar high-quality utilities with favorable regulatory structures and above-average growth opportunities. Our valuation also implies BHE's pipeline group is worth 10 times EBITDA, in line with peer multiples and indicative of the higher returns that pipelines are able to realize.With regards to Berkshire's manufacturing, service and retail operations, our fair value estimate increased 3% to $82,000 ($55) per Class A (B) share, most of which was tied primarily to time value of money considerations. Our long-term forecast models past behavior by including bolt-on acquisitions to our future revenue projections, with revenue increasing at a mid- to high-single-digit rate the next five years. As for profitability, we see operating margins expanding by 20 basis points annually over the 7.0% level the segment reported in 2016. With regards to company's finance and financial products division, which includes Clayton Homes (manufactured housing and finance), CORT Business Services (furniture rental), Marmon (rail car and other transportation equipment manufacturing, repair and leasing) and XTRA (over-the-road trailer leasing), we've increased our fair value estimate for this unit slightly to $9,200 ($6) per Class A (B) share after raising our long-term expectations and incorporating the Oakwood Homes and Home Capital Group deals into the segment. Oakwood Homes, a private home building firm in Colorado and Utah, was purchased by Clayton Homes. It is the largest of the four site-build home building operators that Clayton has acquired the past several years. We've also assumed that the CAD 2 ($1.6) billion line of credit that Berkshire has extended to the struggling Canadian mortgage lender, Home Capital Group, which also came with a CAD 400 ($316) million investment in the company's stock, is being financed out of this division (which had $11.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents in tis books at the end of the first quarter). Berkshire's book value per Class A equivalent share at the end of the first quarter of 2017 was $178,073. We think the firm can continue to grow its book value per share at a high-single-to-double-digit rate going forward, much as we've seen since the start of the new millennium. This would leave book value per Class A equivalent share at $191,800 at the end of this year and $210,700 at the end of 2018. Depending on the timing of U.S. corporate tax reform, Berkshire will likely see a one-time step up in its book value, as the deferred tax liability associated with its investment portfolio (which amounted to $27.7 billion at the end of 2016) and other assets gets written down to reflect a lower statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. Our best guess is that this would result in at least a 5% increase in book value per share. This is important, as Berkshire tends to trade on book value per share, with the company's shares trading at 1.4 times book value on average the past five and 10 years (and 1.5 times over the past fifteen years). The shares traded as high as 1.6 times book value in 2014 and 1.5 times book value last year.While Berkshire closed out the first quarter of 2017 with $96.5 billion in cash on its books, a portion of that capital has already been spoken for. For starters, Buffett has been fairly explicit about his desire to keep around $20 billion in cash on hand as a backstop for the insurance business. We believe rest of the firm's operations are also likely to require at least 2% of annual revenue on hand as operating cash, which would amount to around $5.2 billion based on our top-line forecast for 2017. Toss in another $5.3 billion as starter cash for capital spending projects (which are likely to approach $13 billion this year), and Berkshire likely had $66.0 billion in dry powder at the end of the first quarter that could be used toward acquisitions and other investments, as well as share repurchases and dividends. Since that time, we've seen the firm commit $9 billion to the Oncor deal, another $1 billion to stock purchases, and around $1.6 billion as a line of credit for the struggling Home Capital Group. This would reduce that dry power amount to around $54 billion. That said, the firm likely pulled in another $4 billion in free cash flow during the second quarter, so we're likely looking at dry powder in the $55-$60 billion range, which would be more than enough to provide a capital infusion to Sprint--that is, of course, assuming that Berkshire gets high interest paying preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares down the road in return for the Buffett seal of approval.Strong Organic Growth and Market Gains Lift BlackRock's 2Q AUM Higher; FVE Raised to $475 per Shareby Greggory Warren, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-17-17 We've increased our fair value estimate for wide-moat-rated BlackRock to $475 per share from $460 after updating our valuation for changes in assets under management, revenue, and profitability since our last update. BlackRock closed out the June quarter with a record $5.689 trillion in managed assets. This was about $175 billion higher than our forecast, with more than $70 billion of the difference due to more favorable currency exchange, another $50 billion coming from stronger active, institutional index and iShares flows, and the remainder due to greater market gains than we were forecasting.Long-term net inflows of $93.5 billion were similar to results from the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, when BlackRock recorded $80.3 billion and $87.8 billion in total long-term inflows, respectively. While iShares remains the largest driver of BlackRock's inflows, picking up another $72.8 billion in AUM during the second quarter, the firm also saw positive flows from its retail ($8.6 billion) and institutional ($12.1 billion) platforms. BlackRock's organic growth rate of 7% over the past four calendar quarters was comfortably above management's annual target rate of 5%. We now expect organic growth of 5%-7% for the full year (compared with 4%-6% previously).Much like we saw during the first quarter, BlackRock turned 15.5% average AUM growth in the second quarter into 7.5% revenue growth, as mix shift and fee compression weighed on the firm's top line. Revenue growth of 7.4% through the first six months of 2017 is right in line with our forecast for mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth for the full year. With regards to profitability, BlackRock reported a 190-basis-point increase in adjusted operating margins (to 41.3% of revenue) when compared with the first half of 2016. We expect full-year adjusted operating margins of 41%-43%, with the firm's free cash flow approaching $3.5 billion.Looking more closely at the firm's fund flows, BlackRock's ability to put together three straight quarters with inflows in excess of $80 billion speaks to the strength and diversification of its operations. Total equity inflows of $38.4 billion during the second quarter were driven by the firm's iShares ($51.8 billion) operations. Active equities remain in net outflow mode, with another $7.6 billion flowing out during the period, and institutional equity index portfolios saw $5.8 billion in outflows. Given the meaningfully higher fees BlackRock charges for its active equity operations (of 57 basis points relative to 28 basis points for iShares equity offerings and 5 basis points for institutional index funds), the firm would go a long way toward enhancing organic AUM and revenue growth if it ever got the performance of its actively managed funds back on track. BlackRock closed out the June quarter with 62%, 78%, and 66% of their fundamental equity funds above the benchmark or peer median on a 1-, 3-, and 5-year basis, respectively, which was much better than what we saw at the end of the March quarter. That said, we believe it is more prudent to stay conservative on any sort of recovery, especially with active asset managers' fees and performance under a much larger microscope than they've even been before, following in the aftermath of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule.BlackRock's fixed-income platform shrugged off the dual headwinds of a rising U.S stock market and rising rates (with the Federal Reserve increasing the federal-funds rate near the end of both the March and June quarters this year), posting $42.9 billion in inflows during the second quarter. Flows were driven primarily by iShares ($20.9 billion) and the firm's institutional index ($18.0 billion) operations, with positive flows from its actively managed fixed-income operations (of $4.0 billion) being an added bonus. At the end of the March quarter, 75%, 77%, and 88% of BlackRock's actively managed taxable bond funds were beating their benchmark or peer medians on a 1-, 3-, and 5-year basis, respectively, while 53%, 54%, and 68% of tax-exempt offerings were doing the same. We expect iShares fixed-income operations to continue to be the more consistent and substantial organic growth vehicle for BlackRock. The $63.6 billion of net inflows produced by the ETF platform during the past year was reflective of a 20.9% organic growth rate. While the company continues to battle Vanguard for ETF flows, the two firms are still capturing more than two thirds of industry's inflows, which has allowed iShares to maintain its market share at 38%-39% the past five years (while Vanguard's has risen from 18% to 25%).Based on our current forecasts for the firm, we see BlackRock generating close to $3.5 billion in free cash flow this year. The company remains committed to buying back $275 million of its common stock each quarter, which it did again during the second quarter of 2017. As we noted last period, the company increased its quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share, reflective of a 9% increase in the dividend. And based on our updated earnings estimate for 2017, the payout ratio for the company's $2.50 per share quarterly dividend is around 46%--within management's targeted range of 40%-50%--with the current yield being 2.4%. BlackRock is now trading at around a 12% discount to our revised fair value estimate of $475 per share. EBay Platform Enhancements Driving Improved Fundamentals, but Shares Strike Us as Fairly Valuedby R.J. Hottovy, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-21-17 Our thesis on eBay is intact following its second-quarter update, with platform enhancements driving improved results but also appropriately valued by the market. The firm has clearly improved its competitive position since the May 2014 data breach/password reset issues and changes in Google's search engine algorithm through new user experiences and homepage supported by structured data/AI efforts, mobile platform upgrades, a more aggressive brand campaign, new delivery speed search functionality, and adoption of promoted listing advertising for sellers. These measures helped to drive constant-currency marketplaces GMV growth of 6% (a slight acceleration from the 5% posted the prior two quarters and offsetting a 5% decline in StubHub GMV due to a weak U.S. events market), active-user growth of 4%, and a second straight quarter of acceleration in the number of sellers on eBay (with contribution from large brands called out). In our view, this validates the network effect underpinning our narrow moat rating.We still find management's 2017 guidance realistic, including organic revenue growth of 6%-8% ($9.3 billion-$9.5 billion, though management noted that this would likely come in ahead of the high end if foreign exchange rates don't change), operating margins of 29%-31%, and adjusted EPS between $1.98 and $2.03. While the market was looking for an increase in eBay's full-year outlook, we believe it factors in the competitive environment (where our analysis suggests Amazon is also seeing seller growth acceleration) and technology/brand investments. Traditional retailers looking for greater online distribution and new international opportunities (including Flipkart) could set the stage for upside, but we remain comfortable with our longer-term outlook calling for average annual revenue growth in the midsingle digits and operating margins of 32%. As such, we're not planning material changes to our $33 fair value estimate, and we view shares as fairly valued.Novartis' 2Q Largely as Expected, With Strong New Product Sales Offsetting Generic Gleevec Pressureby Damien Conover, CFA | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-18-17 Novartis posted second-quarter results largely in line with our and consensus expectations, and we don't expect any major changes to our fair value estimate. We continue to view the stock as modestly undervalued. Despite the increasing generic pressure on the branded drug segment, a strong pipeline gives us confidence in Novartis' wide moat.In the quarter, new product launches helped offset generic competition, leading to flat operational sales growth, which we expect will continue through 2017 followed by a return to growth in 2018 of 3%. Generic Gleevec caused the majority of the headwinds in the quarter, and we expect this pressure will subside in 2018 as the patent loss annualizes. Importantly, the company's next-generation drug Tasigna continues to hold up well, and we project flat sales for it over the next three years. Helping to offset the generic headwinds, the company's recently launched drugs are posting steady gains. In particular, immunology drug Cosentyx and cardiovascular drug Entresto are together already contributing close to 5% of the top line, and we expect this to grow to over 12% by 2020 based on efficacy advantages over competitive drugs. Looking ahead at the late-stage pipeline, we are bullish on ophthalmology drug RTH258 based on superior dosing, but the filing isn't expected until the second half of 2018.Outside the branded drug group, the remaining divisions of Sandoz (generics) and Alcon (eye care) are weighing on results, with operating income in both groups down 7% operationally year over year. At Sandoz, increasing competition in the United States is dragging down pricing, but we expect the strong position in biosimilars should return the group to growth in 2018. For Alcon, heavy reinvestment should continue to improve top-line growth and should moderate in 2018, shifting the group to positive operating income growth.Solid First Half With Margin Expansion for Unilever; Raising FVE Slightlyby Philip Gorham, CFA, FRM | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-20-17Unilever's first-half performance showed that our margin expansion thesis is intact, and strong sales growth in Asia meant that the company modestly exceeded our expectations on the top line. Significantly, this flowed through the income statement to earnings, and we are raising our fair value estimate a touch to EUR 52 per Amsterdam-traded ordinary share. Although organic growth remains below historical levels, Unilever's entrenched position in the supply chain of its retailers, the source of its wide economic moat, was again in evidence as growth exceeded that of its markets and the company took value share, in aggregate.First-half underlying sales growth in the Asia segment of 5.5% took us by surprise, and was the only material variance from our forecasts. The second-quarter volume decline of 0.6% indicates that price increases of around 5%, implemented to offset commodity cost inflation, are sticking better than we had expected, with price elasticity proving to be quite low so far. The pricing also dropped to the bottom line, with the underlying EBIT margin expanding 180 basis points year over year, slightly ahead of our expectations.We have raised our near-term forecasts for sales, EBIT, and earnings growth, and this accounts for more than half of our fair value increase (the remainder being the impact of the time value of money since our last update). This report has no impact on our medium- and long-term expectations, however, and we continue to forecast 4% organic sales growth and a 19% normalised medium-term EBIT margin.While our sales growth assumes pricing pressure continues to weigh on organic growth, our EBIT margin assumption is aggressive, which is one of the key metrics underlying our valuation. Unilever is making structural changes to its operating model that we expect will facilitate more efficient internal capital allocation, and the operating margin expansion reflected solid progress in that regard.With Reckitt Benckiser having just sold its foods division for a whopping 21 times EBITDA, Unilever will no doubt be hopeful that it can realize a similar multiple for its spreads business. However, we estimate that first-half sales fell by 3.5% year over year, in contrast to the 5% growth achieved by RB's food segment in 2016, so we doubt that, even in the current climate, Unilever's assets will be valued at such a multiple. We continue to assume that at 10 times last year's EBITDA, the business would be worth around EUR 6 billion.Smooth Sailing for Wide-Moat Visa in Fiscal 3Qby Jim Sinegal | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-20-17 Wide-moat Visa continued to generate double-digit growth and high returns on capital in its fiscal third quarter, and we plan to maintain our $108 per share fair value estimate. The company's global network of financial institutions, consumers, and merchants constitutes an enormous competitive advantage over competitors. Visa's brand further represents global acceptance and transaction security to its customers, while its position as the world's largest consumer-to-business payment network provides economies of scale. The market for the company's services continues to grow with consumer spending and the global decline of cash, allowing the firm to grow quickly without much investment of capital. Visa returned 100% of fiscal third-quarter income to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases, while growing total transactions--including those processed by Visa Europe--at a 13% adjusted rate over the past 12 months.Volatility in certain drivers helped the business during the quarter. Rebates and incentives came in at 20.1% of gross revenue due primarily to a delay in boosting these payments to customers in Europe. We don't read too much into quarterly changes in rebates and incentives payments, instead preferring to focus on long-term trends. We do think that customers will continue to demand a larger share of payment economics, but expect changes to be gradual and manageable. Management indicated that the company's ancillary offerings are becoming increasingly attractive to smaller issuers that may not have the same technical capabilities as the largest banks. We don't explicitly forecast much additional revenue from data-focused offerings, but see a moderation in pricing pressure as a clear benefit. Currency movements in European markets also boosted cross-border revenue.Visa's efforts to open and expand its network also seem likely to moderate competitive pressures. In the last few days, Visa and PayPal expanded their partnership, allowing PayPal to issue Visa debit cards within Europe. This expands PayPal’s ambitions in traditional financial services--it will utilize a pre-existing banking license as it grows its retail banking business--and gives it access to point-of-sale payments. It also provides yet another source of additional transaction volume for Visa.Political Reality too Much for GOP Healthcare Overhaul; Mixed Impact for Our Healthcare Coverageby Vishnu Lekraj | Morningstar Research Services LLC | 07-18-17The political reality of scaling back healthcare coverage for millions of constituents was too much for the U.S. Senate GOP to overcome in passing a major overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. With the loss of more than two “yes” votes for both the initial and revised Senate Republican plan, Senate majority leadership was unable to push a measure that would be appealing to both the moderate and libertarian wings of its caucus. Thus, we believe the probability of a substantive “repeal and replace” plan becoming law is now extremely low. On balance, we find this development positive for both the managed care and hospital sectors as volume increases due to expanded coverage will remain in place. On the other end of the spectrum, the elimination of various ACA fees and taxes for pharmaceutical and device companies is now off the table. Even though this development maintains a status quo operating environment, it does take away a potential positive financial impact for these firms.From here we believe the Senate will take a step toward shoring up a weak public exchange marketplace in order to maintain a functioning private individual insurance market over the near term. This will likely require some meaningful level of bipartisan negotiation in both chambers of congress. Despite the rhetoric of letting these marketplaces fail, we believe it will be politically untenable for Republicans to allow this scenario to playout given they control every branch of the federal government and a significant percentage of affected voting districts are either Republican or tossup leaning. Additionally, we believe congressional GOP leadership is keen to move on from the political minefield of healthcare legislation and toward initiating a major overhaul of U.S. tax code.Bottom line, we believe the ACA will likely remain in place for some time to come and its dominant affect upon healthcare-related firms will continue. However, we also believe there will need to be legislation to address long-term issues and concerns related to certain aspects of the law. Chiefly, lawmakers will have to formulate a long-term plan to stabilize the public exchange/individual markets (which comprise approximately a quarter of the private insurance space) in order to keep premium costs in check, incentivize robust health insurance company participation, and prevent a death-spiral scenario from developing.------------------------------------------------------------©2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Editor Ben Johnson draws upon academic and practitioner research--including Morningstar's sizeable bench of stock, bond and fund analysts—to find reliable drivers of outperformance.
                         








Objective 
Morningstar ETFInvestor features two real-money portfolios.
                    

                        The ETF Income Portfolio assembles a high-quality collection of income-generating ETFs with the goal of earning 5% in excess of the 30-day T-bill rate over a full business cycle. The portfolio adheres to a benchmark-agnostic strategy in its search for absolute returns.
                    


                        The ETF Global Asset Allocation Portfolio, on the other hand, is more benchmark sensitive. It seeks undervalued asset classes with improving fundamentals. The strategy seeks to beat the 60/40 MSCI ACWI/Barclays US Aggregate benchmark over a full business cycle, with the least risk possible.

LLC FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Limited Liability Companies | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

History[edit]
Founder Joe Mansueto initially had the idea for Morningstar in 1982 while reviewing mutual fund annual reports he had requested from several prominent fund managers.[4] However, it was only after a year working as a stock analyst for Harris Associates, seeing the fund industry and potential competitors up close, that he was convinced that the opportunity was there.[4][5] Morningstar was subsequently founded in 1984 from his one-bedroom Chicago apartment with an initial investment of US$80,000.[6] The name Morningstar is taken from the last sentence in Walden, a book by Henry David Thoreau; "the sun is but a morning star".[6][7]
In July 1999, Morningstar accepted an investment of US$91 million from SoftBank in return for a 20 percent stake in the company. The two companies had formed a joint venture in Japan the previous year.[7][8]
Morningstar's initial public offering occurred on May 3, 2005, with 7,612,500 shares at $18.50 each.[9] The manner in which Morningstar went public is notable. They elected to follow Google's footsteps and use the OpenIPO method rather than the traditional method. This allowed individual investors to bid on the price of the stock, and allowed all investors equal access.
As of February 2015, Joe Mansueto owned approximately 55% of the outstanding shares in Morningstar.[10]
In September 2016, Morningstar announced that it had appointed Kunal Kapoor as chief executive officer, effective January 2017, with Mansueto becoming executive chairman at the same time. [11][1]
Corporate identity[edit]
Morningstar's current logo is notable in that it was designed by Paul Rand. Mansueto sought Rand out in 1989 after deciding that the company's design standards needed to be improved, and that the first step would be a redesign of its logo.[12] After several phone calls, letters and finally a trip to meet Rand in person, Mansueto convinced him to work on the logo, which was completed within four months.[12] The new design features the "o" in Morningstar appearing as a rising sun, which is a nod to the quote that inspired the company's name.[6] While the fee for this work ($50,000) was a significant amount at the time for the company, Mansueto considers it "one of our most valuable assets".[12]

History[edit]
Founder Joe Mansueto initially had the idea for Morningstar in 1982 while reviewing mutual fund annual reports he had requested from several prominent fund managers.[4] However, it was only after a year working as a stock analyst for Harris Associates, seeing the fund industry and potential competitors up close, that he was convinced that the opportunity was there.[4][5] Morningstar was subsequently founded in 1984 from his one-bedroom Chicago apartment with an initial investment of US$80,000.[6] The name Morningstar is taken from the last sentence in Walden, a book by Henry David Thoreau; "the sun is but a morning star".[6][7]
In July 1999, Morningstar accepted an investment of US$91 million from SoftBank in return for a 20 percent stake in the company. The two companies had formed a joint venture in Japan the previous year.[7][8]
Morningstar's initial public offering occurred on May 3, 2005, with 7,612,500 shares at $18.50 each.[9] The manner in which Morningstar went public is notable. They elected to follow Google's footsteps and use the OpenIPO method rather than the traditional method. This allowed individual investors to bid on the price of the stock, and allowed all investors equal access.
As of February 2015, Joe Mansueto owned approximately 55% of the outstanding shares in Morningstar.[10]
In September 2016, Morningstar announced that it had appointed Kunal Kapoor as chief executive officer, effective January 2017, with Mansueto becoming executive chairman at the same time. [11][1]
Corporate identity[edit]
Morningstar's current logo is notable in that it was designed by Paul Rand. Mansueto sought Rand out in 1989 after deciding that the company's design standards needed to be improved, and that the first step would be a redesign of its logo.[12] After several phone calls, letters and finally a trip to meet Rand in person, Mansueto convinced him to work on the logo, which was completed within four months.[12] The new design features the "o" in Morningstar appearing as a rising sun, which is a nod to the quote that inspired the company's name.[6] While the fee for this work ($50,000) was a significant amount at the time for the company, Mansueto considers it "one of our most valuable assets".[12]

In July 1999, Morningstar accepted an investment of US$91 million from SoftBank in return for a 20 percent stake in the company. The two companies had formed a joint venture in Japan the previous year.[7][8]
Morningstar's initial public offering occurred on May 3, 2005, with 7,612,500 shares at $18.50 each.[9] The manner in which Morningstar went public is notable. They elected to follow Google's footsteps and use the OpenIPO method rather than the traditional method. This allowed individual investors to bid on the price of the stock, and allowed all investors equal access.

Mansueto sought Rand out in 1989 after deciding that the company's design standards needed to be improved, and that the first step would be a redesign of its logo.[12] After several phone calls, letters and finally a trip to meet Rand in person, Mansueto convinced him to work on the logo, which was completed within four months.[12] The new design features the "o" in Morningstar appearing as a rising sun, which is a nod to the quote that inspired the company's name.[6] While the fee for this work ($50,000) was a significant amount at the time for the company, Mansueto considers it "one of our most valuable assets".[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
