Petroleum prices: the influence of industry and geopolitics
The moderate recovery in oil barrel prices that took place during the last week in June was caused by a fall in USA oil and petrol reserves, but the trend remains depressed due to other factors, including the rise of global reserves and the increase of exports by Nigeria and Libya.

Gas: the new star


In a constantly evolving energy scenario, the importance of natural gas is growing.
            Eni is among the leaders of this transition. Discoveries such as the Coral field,

Refining & Marketing

Refining and innovation
For us, refining has a strategic role and we continue to innovate techniques and products. We have enhanced our investments in research while betting on the redevelopment of the older industrial sites of Gela and Porto Marghera near Venice. At the latter, for example, we have created new Eni Diesel+ biofuel that reduces emissions and fuel consumption.

Jangkrik in Indonesia
Jangkrik in Indonesia


Crickets are insects able to move fast by jumping very high. In the Indonesian language
            a cricket is called a jangkrik and the project was given this name in the hope that
            it would run quickly and with high reserves. Expectations have been met: after the
            first discovery, which came about in 2009, milestones were rapidly passed.

Eni's commitment to energy transition
Eni is contributing to the process that will lead to the use of renewable energy sources
         – the so-called "decarbonisation" of the economy. The role of gas is critical
         because it is the fossil fuel most suitable to be combined with wind and sun energy.
         It is in the natural-gas sector that we want to invest, continuing to cut CO2 emissions.
         Along with nine other energy companies, we have launched the OGCI (Oil & Gas Climate
         Initiative) with the aim of promoting measures to further reduce emissions. We will
         invest $1 billion over the next 10 years to tackle climate change.
      








Integrated strategy


Eni's contribution during energy transition


Eni has developed an integrated strategy as part of our contribution to the transition of energy towards a low-carbon future. This involves promoting the growth of renewables and supporting their more extensive use in countries where we operate, while encouraging research into new sources of energy.

Gas & Power

In step with the times
The world is moving and we are, too – thanks to electricity and natural gas.

Our strategy includes a special focus on the Planet
We decided to invest in electricity and gas – energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, natural gas is beneficial both economically and environmentally: we transform primary energy into electrical energy and move the world... naturally.

Gas & Power: the long journey







On ships or through pipelines, gas makes a long journey before being fed into the distribution network and reaching industries and homes.

The cities of electricity

Ferrera Erbognone, Ravenna, Mantova, Brindisi, Ferrara and Bolgiano are the places around Italy where we produce electricity. In 2016 we generated 21.78 terawatt hours (+1.09 TWh compared with 2015) a sold 6.2% more than in 2015. Our energy arrives everywhere: the increase in sales is the result of higher volumes sold to both wholesale and residential customers.
























Providing gas and electricity to the world







We are active globally in the trading of oil, natural gas, LNG and electricity, in 30 countries around the world. Russia, Netherlands, Norway, Libya, Algeria and Italy are the main countries of supply and Italy and Europe, as well as North America, are our target markets.

Transparent communication and clarity
Clear dialogue with our stakeholders enables us to have constructive exchanges based
               on integrity. Clear communication gains us the trust of those who work with us.
            








Materiality
The determination process of material issues began with the identification of issues
                        which were deemed more important for business: social and environmental spheres and
                        the issue of governance.
                     







The certification process and sustainability reporting 
Our sustainability is certified: the auditing company Reconta Ernst & Young SpA
                        certified our reporting.
                     







GRI Content Index
It is an opportunity to strengthen the determination process of materiality. Since
                        2014 we have been adopting new guidelines for our sustainability reporting - the "G4
                        Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and Oil & Gas Sector Disclosures".

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]

As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni).

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

Eni S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [ˈɛːni]) is an Italian multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Rome. Considered one of the global supermajors, it has operations in 79 countries, and is currently world's 11th largest industrial company with a market capitalization of 68 billion euros (US$ 90 billion), as of August 14, 2013.[3] The Italian government owns a 30.303% golden share in the company, 3.934% held through the state Treasury and 26.369% held through the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Another 2.012% of the shares are held by People's Bank of China.[4] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5]
The name "ENI" was initially the acronym of "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi" (national hydrocarbons authority). Through the years after its foundation however, it operated in a large number of fields including contracting, nuclear power, energy, mining, chemicals and plastics, refining/extraction and distribution machinery, hospitality industry and even textile industry and news.
Eni constantly ranks among the top 100 on Fortune Global 500 list for largest companies by revenue. In 2016, the company holds the 65th place, a fall of 40 places from the previous year's 25th rank.[6]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]
Operations[edit]

Exploration and production[edit]
As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]

Subsidiaries[edit]
Eni's principal subsidiaries include:

Eni Gas & Power[141] (100% owned) – a natural gas and power company based in Belgium formed by merger of Distrigas and Nuon Belgium
versalis (fr) (100% owned) – Versalis is a chemical company that manages the production and marketing of petrochemical products such as olefines, aromatics and intermediates (base chemicals), styrenes, elastomers and polyethylene, plus in recent years a focus on green chemistry, being also able to count on a range of proprietary technologies, advanced plant facilities and a broad-based distribution network.[citation needed]
Saipem (43% owned) – Saipem is an oil and gas industry contractor. Saipem has contracted for engineering, oilfield services and construction both offshore and onshore through several pipelines, including Blue Stream, Greenstream, Nord Stream and South Stream. It is a subsidiary listed on the Italian Stock Exchange.

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]
After corruption charges against the subsidiary Saipem, Eni's CFO Alessandro Bernini had to resign and the new CFO Massimo Mondazzi took over in December 2012.[147]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]
Operations[edit]

Exploration and production[edit]
As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni). In 2012 351 development wells were drilled as well, as 407 in 2011 and 399 in 2010.[115][116][117]

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]

As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni).

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

Eni S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [ˈɛːni]) is an Italian multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Rome. Considered one of the global supermajors, it has operations in 79 countries, and is currently world's 11th largest industrial company with a market capitalization of 68 billion euros (US$ 90 billion), as of August 14, 2013.[3] The Italian government owns a 30.303% golden share in the company, 3.934% held through the state Treasury and 26.369% held through the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Another 2.012% of the shares are held by People's Bank of China.[4] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5]
The name "ENI" was initially the acronym of "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi" (national hydrocarbons authority). Through the years after its foundation however, it operated in a large number of fields including contracting, nuclear power, energy, mining, chemicals and plastics, refining/extraction and distribution machinery, hospitality industry and even textile industry and news.
Eni constantly ranks among the top 100 on Fortune Global 500 list for largest companies by revenue. In 2016, the company holds the 65th place, a fall of 40 places from the previous year's 25th rank.[6]
In July 2017, the oil giant accepted responsibility for an oil spill affecting the Fylde coast of Blackpool in the United Kingdom. http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/environment/latest-oil-giant-accepts-responsibility-for-spill-affecting-fylde-coast-1-8658634

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]
Operations[edit]

Exploration and production[edit]
As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni). In 2012 351 development wells were drilled as well, as 407 in 2011 and 399 in 2010.[115][116][117]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]

Petroleum prices: the influence of industry and geopolitics
The moderate recovery in oil barrel prices that took place during the last week in June was caused by a fall in USA oil and petrol reserves, but the trend remains depressed due to other factors, including the rise of global reserves and the increase of exports by Nigeria and Libya.

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]

In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni).

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]
Operations[edit]

Exploration and production[edit]
As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni). In 2012 351 development wells were drilled as well, as 407 in 2011 and 399 in 2010.[115][116][117]
Gas and Power[edit]

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

History[edit]
1950s–1960s[edit]




Palazzo ENI, Rome, built 1959-1962.[7] Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967.


Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[8][9] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11]
Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.[12] Since 1995 the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13]
In 1952 Eni chooses its own logo, the six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15]
Starting 1954 Eni holds extensive exploration rights in North Africa,[12] signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser[16] while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[17]
In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the "Mattei formula",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Company.[20][21][22]
In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at very reasonable prices.[23][24]
On 27 October 1962 Enrico Mattei died on an aircraft accident involving his twin-jet while surrounding Bascapè,[25] on his way to Milan from Catania.[26]
During the following years, Eni signed contracts in joint venture with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[27]
In 1967 Eni acquired Italgas.[28]
1970s–1980s[edit]
In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the embargo[29][30] against the United States and the Netherlands agreed by OPEC members Arab countries, a serious oil crisis occurred,[31] pushing Eni in need to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[32] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[33]
In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with Libyan government, followed by further agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,[34][35][36][37] while developing two new major oil discoveries in the British North Sea got on 1972.[38]
During the mid-1970s Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41]
After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Boùri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45]
1990s–2000s[edit]
In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53]
From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56]
As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59]
2000s–2010s[edit]
Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62]
In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65]
In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68]
Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69]
In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72]
After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91]
2010 to present[edit]
In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92]
Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in Česká rafinerská a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93]
In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94]
In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95]
Operations[edit]

Exploration and production[edit]
As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[96] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[97][98][99][100] Venezuela,[101][102] Barents Sea,[103][104] Yamal Peninsula,[105][106] Kazakhstan,[107][108] Iraq[109] and the Far East).[110][111] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[112] such as Eni Norge.[113]
In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[96][114]
During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni).

Eni India – is expected to start drilling at a deepwater block 2, near Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Q2 of 2011 as it has received 2-year extension for the completion of drilling program. The program was delayed due to various environmental issues and scarcity of oil rigs. ENI India had won this block in 2005 and partners with ONGC and GAIL India.[143]

Legal Problems[edit]
The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom[144]
In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[145]
In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi. [146]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
