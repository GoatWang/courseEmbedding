LONGWOOD, Fla., July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mantra Venture Group, Ltd. (OTC:MVTG) (the “Company”) announces a new Master Services Agreement with a telecommunications carrier for the use of its Drone Mapping Services. While the contract is of indeterminate value, the Company recently received its first purchase order and the use of the product is expected to begin immediately.


Roger Ponder, CEO, stated: "Through our subsidiary, AW Solutions, we have developed a new cutting-edge technology that is industry leading for the remote mapping and measuring of elevated infrastructure utilizing UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones. The current level of accuracy, utilizing existing technology, is in excess of 3/4 of an inch which does not allow the utilization of the data collected for a structural analysis to take place. AW Solutions now can to obtain accuracies superior to 1/16th of an inch which is the minimum threshold.” “This technology has already been field tested in a live environment and now we have executed Master Service Agreements (MSA’s) with major carriers and tower aggregators for tower mapping and analysis services and also visual observations on environmentally sensitive sites where protected species are present.” Roger Ponder goes on to say “while our initial roll-out is focused on telecommunications towers and antenna mounting structures, this drone technology is also applicable in many other industries including: oil & gas; transportation & shipping; commercial construction; military and any industry where structures need physical measurements taken, which will provide our company with additional revenue streams. Through the use of remote sensing it mitigates the need for people to climb and measure structures and therefore is a safety multiplier for the work environment that reduces risk exposures to workers, businesses and the public.”    
About Mantra Venture Group: Mantra Venture Group Ltd. (MVTG) operates through its AW Solutions and Mantra Energy Alternatives subsidiaries. AW Solutions (AW) is a leading provider of telecommunications engineering and infrastructure services across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam and Caribbean.

(OTC:MVTG) (the “Company”) announces a new Master Services Agreement with a telecommunications carrier for the use of its Drone Mapping Services. While the contract is of indeterminate value, the Company recently received its first purchase order and the use of the product is expected to begin immediately. Roger Ponder, CEO, stated: "Through our subsidiary, AW Solutions, we have developed a new cutting-edge technology that is industry leading for the remote mapping and measuring of elevated infrastructure utilizing UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones. The current level of accuracy, utilizing existing technology, is in excess of 3/4 of an inch which does not allow the utilization of the data collected for a structural analysis to take place. AW Solutions now can to obtain accuracies superior to 1/16th of an inch which is the minimum threshold.” “This technology has already been field tested in a live environment and now we have executed Master Service Agreements (MSA’s) with major carriers and tower aggregators for tower mapping and analysis services and also visual observations on environmentally sensitive sites where protected species are present.” Roger Ponder goes on to say “while our initial roll-out is focused on telecommunications towers and antenna mounting structures, this drone technology is also applicable in many other industries including: oil & gas; transportation & shipping; commercial construction; military and any industry where structures need physical measurements taken, which will provide our company with additional revenue streams. Through the use of remote sensing it mitigates the need for people to climb and measure structures and therefore is a safety multiplier for the work environment that reduces risk exposures to workers, businesses and the public.”

ERC offers a solution to reduce the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on Earth's environment by converting CO2 into chemicals with a range of commercial applications, including a fuel for fuel cells. Powered by electricity, the ERC process combines captured carbon dioxide with water to produce materials, such as formic acid, formate salts, oxalic acid and methanol, that are conventionally obtained from the thermo-chemical processing of fossil fuels.

LONGWOOD, Fla., July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mantra Venture Group, Ltd. (OTC:MVTG) (the “Company”) announces a new Master Services Agreement with a telecommunications carrier for the use of its Drone Mapping Services. While the contract is of indeterminate value, the Company recently received its first purchase order and the use of the product is expected to begin immediately. Roger Ponder, CEO, stated: "Through our subsidiary, AW Solutions, we have developed a new cutting-edge technology that is industry leading for the remote mapping and measuring of elevated infrastructure utilizing UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones. The current level of accuracy, utilizing existing technology, is in excess of 3/4 of an inch which does not allow the utilization of the data collected for a structural analysis to take place. AW Solutions now can to obtain accuracies superior to 1/16th of an inch which is the minimum threshold.” “This technology has already been field tested in a live environment and now we have executed Master Service Agreements (MSA’s) with major carriers and tower aggregators for tower mapping and analysis services and also visual observations on environmentally sensitive sites where protected species are present.” Roger Ponder goes on to say “while our initial roll-out is focused on telecommunications towers and antenna mounting structures, this drone technology is also applicable in many other industries including: oil & gas; transportation & shipping; commercial construction; military and any industry where structures need physical measurements taken, which will provide our company with additional revenue streams. Through the use of remote sensing it mitigates the need for people to climb and measure structures and therefore is a safety multiplier for the work environment that reduces risk exposures to workers, businesses and the public.”    About Mantra Venture Group: Mantra Venture Group Ltd. (MVTG) operates through its AW Solutions and Mantra Energy Alternatives subsidiaries. AW Solutions (AW) is a leading provider of telecommunications engineering and infrastructure services across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam and Caribbean.
