            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership.  Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners while Ferrellgas Finance Corp. serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is not presented.  In this Item 2 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context indicates otherwise:   "us," "we," "our," "ours," "consolidated," or "Ferrellgas" are references exclusively to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., except when used in connection with "common units," in which case these terms refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. without its consolidated subsidiaries;   "Ferrellgas Partners" refers to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. itself, without its consolidated subsidiaries;   the "operating partnership" refers to Ferrellgas, L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Finance Corp.;   our "general partner" refers to Ferrellgas, Inc.;   "Ferrell Companies" refers to Ferrell Companies, Inc., the sole shareholder of our general partner;   "unitholders" refers to holders of common units of Ferrellgas Partners;   "retail sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Retail - Sales to End Users or the volume of propane sold primarily to our residential, industrial/commercial and agricultural customers;   "wholesale sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Wholesale - Sales to Resellers or the volume of propane sold primarily to our portable tank exchange customers and bulk propane sold to wholesale customers;   "other gas sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Other Gas Sales or the volume of bulk propane sold to other third party propane distributors or marketers and the volume of refined fuel sold;   "propane sales volume" refers to the volume of propane sold to our retail sales and wholesale sales customers;   "water solutions revenues" refers to fees charged for the processing and disposal of salt water as well as the sale of skimming oil;   "crude oil logistics revenues" refers to fees charged for crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil;   "crude oil purchases and sales" refers to crude oil purchased and sold in connection with crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil;   "crude oil hauled" refers to the crude oil volume in barrels transported through our operation of a fleet of trucks and tank trailers and rail cars;   "salt water volume" refers to the number of barrels of salt water processed at our disposal sites;   "skimming oil" refers to the oil collected from the process used at our salt water disposal wells through a combination of gravity and chemicals to separate crude oil that is dissolved in the salt water;  Table of Contents   "Notes" refers to the notes of the condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas Partners or the operating partnership, as applicable; and   "MBbls/d" refers to one thousand barrels per day.  Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners' only significant assets are its approximate 99% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership and its 100% equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. The common units of Ferrellgas Partners are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership.  The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings, except for interest expense related to the senior notes co-issued by Ferrellgas Partners and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp.  Our general partner performs all management functions for us and our subsidiaries and holds a 1% general partner interest in Ferrellgas Partners and an approximate 1% general partner interest in the operating partnership. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, beneficially owns approximately 23.2% of our outstanding common units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100% by an employee stock ownership trust.  We file annual, quarterly, and other reports and information with the SEC. You may read and download our SEC filings over the Internet from several commercial document retrieval services as well as at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The discussions set forth in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there exist two material differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Those material differences are:   because Ferrellgas Partners has outstanding $182.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due fiscal 2020, the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness; see the statements of earnings in their respective condensed consolidated financial statements; and   Ferrellgas Partners issued common units during fiscal 2015 and repurchased common units in fiscal 2016.  Table of Contents  Overview  Propane and related equipment sales  We are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the United States as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal 2015 and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States.  We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. We use the definition of "normal" temperatures based on information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage.  Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the "winter heating season"). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability.  We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short-term basis. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment.  Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2016 and 2017 sales commitments and, as of October 31, 2015, have experienced net mark to market losses of approximately $26.3 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as "Prepaid expenses and other current assets," "Other assets, net," "Other current liabilities," "Other liabilities" and "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)," respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to "Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales" in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative propane purchase commitment net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At October 31, 2015, we estimate 55% of currently open financial derivative propane purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months.  Our crude oil logistics segment generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil. Bridger services include transportation through its operation of a fleet of 416 trucks, 684 tank trailers and 1,105 railcars primarily servicing Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Wyoming; pipeline services in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas; and crude oil purchase and sale in connection with pipeline management services. We also operate 19 pipeline injection terminals, approximately 38 MBbls/d of capacity on multiple crude oil pipelines, and barge capacity to transport a minimum of 65 MBbls/d.  Table of Contents  Water solutions  During the quarter ended October 31, 2015, goodwill related to the Midstream operations - water solutions segment was determined to be fully impaired. See Note F - Goodwill and intangible assets, net.  Overview of net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.  "Net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P." in the three months ended October 31, 2015 was $(79.8) million compared to $(32.9) million in the prior year period. This increased loss was primarily due to the following:   a $29.3 million goodwill impairment charge;   a $14.0 million increase in "Loss on disposal of assets and other";   a $13.7 million increase in "Depreciation and amortization expense";   a $9.9 million increase in "Interest expense";   a $9.8 million increase in "Operating expense"; and   a $6.0 million decrease in gross margin in the propane and related equipment sales segment;  partially offset by a $37.7 million increase in gross margin in our newly created Midstream operations - Crude oil logistics segment.  During the three months ended October 31, 2015, we determined that the continued and prolonged decline in the price of crude oil constituted a triggering event for its Midstream operations - water solutions business that required an update to the goodwill impairment assessment as of October 31, 2015. Upon completing the second step of an impairment test as of October 31, 2015 for the Midstream operations - water solutions reporting unit, we determined that Goodwill was fully impaired and have written off the entire $29.3 million of goodwill related to this reporting unit.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.
The Initial Public Offering[edit]
With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989, acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) formed[edit]
In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans, which were supported by the Clinton Administration, helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.
Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002, Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company boasted 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.
Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino[edit]
On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.




Ferrellgas retailer, Sumpter Twp., MI


In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

    OVERLAND PARK, Kan., June 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ferrellgas, L.P., the operating partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP), and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrellgas, L.P., today announced the closing of their private placement offering of $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.750% Senior Notes due 2022 at 104.00%, plus accrued interest from November 4, 2013.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.
A.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C., enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking if he could return home to Kansas to help with struggling family business. It was 1965. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.
James Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.
Purchase of Buckeye Gas Products Company makes Ferrellgas a nationwide company[edit]
Ferrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.
Buckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.
A Wall Street banker James Ferrell met in the early 1980s who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.
The Initial Public Offering[edit]
With the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989, acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
The need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) formed[edit]
In 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans, which were supported by the Clinton Administration, helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.
Growth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002, Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company boasted 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.
Ferrellgas announces merger agreement With Blue Rhino[edit]
On February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Known mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.




Ferrellgas retailer, Sumpter Twp., MI


In September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO in favor of his hand-picked successor, Steve Wambold. Wambold, a ten-year company veteran, had served as the company's president and COO since 2005.
Blue Rhino propane plant explosion[edit]
At the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.[2]
Ferrellgas diversifies with establishment of midstream division[edit]
On May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.
Acquisition of Bridger Logistics[edit]
In June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.[3]
Bridger: An acquisition gone wrong? The increase in Ferrellgas Partners’s (FGP) debt due to the Bridger acquisition was combined with severe headwinds for the company’s midstream operations, as well as unfavorable temperatures for its propane business. All these factors collectively made things very difficult for FGP.
In addition to the debt and unfavorable commodity price environment.
Ownership[edit]
Although publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of March 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.
Locations[edit]
According to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2016, Ferrellgas has 911 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
