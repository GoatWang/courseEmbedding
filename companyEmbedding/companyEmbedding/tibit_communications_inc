PETALUMA, Calif., Jan. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tibit Communications, a Petaluma, CA based start-up developing next-generation pluggable devices designed to virtualize the access network using industry leading Ethernet switching, today announced $13.8M in Series A funding. The funding was provided by a combination of strategic investors and network operators. 















                Traditional switching and access network for PON replaced by Next Generation PON access system
              

 
 



Tibit Communications provides a key component in the re-architecture of the central office into a data center. Small, low-power and low-cost pluggable devices from Tibit allow high-performance Ethernet switching systems in the market now and in the future to replace traditional access equipment — dramatically lowering costs and simplifying the network architecture.  
Tibit's initial products, the Tibit MicroPlug OLT and ONT, will provide FTTx PON fiber access from Ethernet switches, routers, or almost any device with an Ethernet port. Tibit provides the MicroPlug and a software solution to connect with industry leading Software Defined Networking (SDN) orchestrators. 
"Liberty Global is delighted to be partnered with Tibit Communications, which is making profound advancements in the way high-speed access is deployed in the network. Partnering with Tibit fits our strategic GIGAWorld ambition of bringing high-speed gigabit connectivity to homes and businesses as early as possible. The Tibit MicroPlug provides significant flexibility in the systems that we can use to provide FTTx. We can purchase FTTx solutions from a much wider supplier base and get one that best fits the deployment need," says Colin Buechner, Managing Director, Access Networks, of Liberty Global. 
"Tibit's patented MicroPlug technology allows service providers to unlock the hardware-centric solutions in the network today and move to a more open framework of revenue-generating, cloud-based open source software applications," said Richard Stanfield, Co-founder and CEO of Tibit Communications. "Tibit MicroPlugs are used to enable service providers to operate more like a data center, with an infrastructure built on commodity building blocks, open source software, x86-based servers and off-the-shelf equipment." 
Mr. Stanfield continued, "This transition allows operators to decrease both CAPEX and OPEX costs, reduce complexity in the network and increase the agility of the network by developing new applications as software platforms, resulting in a more rapid creation of new services and revenue. Strategic investors, networking equipment manufacturers and network operators have all recognized this breakthrough technology and provided their support for Tibit. We are very grateful to have been so well received in the market."

Constrained by Traditional Network Equipment
Broadband access service providers are faced with the daunting challenge of meeting the needs of the ever changing digital lifestyles of their customer base in a web scale environment. Service providers must meet the needs of this app-focused customer base with agility, elasticity and service velocity. Customers want more bandwidth at a lower price with more features delivered in shorter timeframes.
				
MicroPlug Solution
The Tibit MicroPlug Modules are key pieces of technology in the design of a next generation OLT. Tibit OLT modules can be used to create higher density or more flexible versions of today’s integrated solutions. Additionally, the Tibit OLT module can be used to create forward looking Virtual or Distributed OLT system solutions.

Panel 1 - Fattening Up on Fiber
While most cable technologists insist that the industry's HFC pipes still have long lives ahead of them, cable operators are clearly adding more and more fiber to their networks. Whether they're planning to go all-fiber like Altice USA or fiber-deep like Comcast or just split more fiber nodes, operators are looking to use fiber to offer more bandwidth, remove active devices, run passive DOCSIS and leverage PON technology on their networks, as well as bolster their wireless efforts. In this panel, we'll explore the implications of cable's fiber feeding frenzy.
