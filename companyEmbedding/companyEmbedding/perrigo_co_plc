Important SafetyInformation
Full PrescribingInformation



Testosterone Gel 1% is available only by prescription
    Warning of Secondary Exposure to Testosterone:  Virilization has been reported in children who were secondarily exposed to testosterone gel.  Children should avoid contact with      unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel.  Healthcare providers should advise patients to strictly adhere to recommended instructions for use.
    Indication: Testosterone Gel 1% is used as a replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.  Safety and    efficacy of testosterone gel in males less than 18 years old have not been established.  Testosterone Gel 1% is not intended for use in women.  Topical testosterone products may     have different doses, strengths, or application instructions that may result in different systemic exposure.
    











Important Safety Information

Alogliptin is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin-containing products such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
Acute pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute
pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Alogliptin.
Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious
hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with Alogliptin such as
anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In such
cases, promptly discontinue Alogliptin, assess for other potential causes,
institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative
treatment for diabetes. Use caution in a patient with a history of
angioedema with another DPP-4i because it is unknown whether such
patients will be predisposed to angioedema.
Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal.
Causality cannot be excluded. Baseline liver test panel is recommended.
If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt Alogliptin and assess patient
for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization.
Do not restart Alogliptin if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative
etiology can be found.
Hypoglycemia: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause
hypoglycemia. A lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be
required to minimize the risk when used in combination with Alogliptin.
Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients
taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain
and discontinue drug if appropriate.
Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing
conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Alogliptin or
any other anti-diabetic drug.
Most common adverse reactions (4% of patients treated with Alogliptin
25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo) were
nasopharyngitis (4.4%), headache (4.2%), and upper respiratory tract
infection (4.2%).

Patients taking Alogliptin should contact their health care professionals right
away if they develop signs and symptoms of heart failure such as:

Unusual shortness of breath during daily activities
Trouble breathing when lying down
Tiredness, weakness, or fatigue
Weight gain with swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, or stomach
Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their
health care professionals.

Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their
health care professionals.
Indication
Alogliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve
glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is not for
treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
Please see Full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide for Alogliptin.

Consumer Healthcare
Over The Counter (OTC)


Over The Counter (OTC)
When you shop in any store, whether it's a WalMart, Walgreens, Kroger,  or some other store, you have a choice to make: Buy the national brand product such as Tylenol® or select the store-brand alternative that is next to it. Perrigo manufactures store-brand products that meet or exceed quality standards set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Your store-brand purchases perform like the national brands. In fact, healthcare professionals agree that store brands represent your best value. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist about the quality of store brands. Compare the active ingredient(s) and performance of store-brands with their national-brand counterparts.








The future growth in OTCs will, in part, be fueled by Rx-to-OTC switches. Perrigo strives to be first to market with products that will switch to OTC status.

Perrigo Home
About Us
Perrigo History


Our History
The Early Years
In 1887 Luther Perrigo, the proprietor of a general store and apple-drying business, had the idea to package and distribute patented medicines and household items for country stores. Located in Allegan, Michigan, the L. Perrigo Company enjoyed steady growth and, by the early 1920s, Perrigo was exceeding the needs of its rural store customers throughout the Midwest. 
Along the way, the company began leveraging the "private label" concept as a way to enhance customer loyalty. For no additional cost, Perrigo offered to imprint the individual store's name on the labels of epsom salts, sweet oil, bay rum and dozens of other wet and dry goods stocked in general stores.
Deep Roots in Manufacturing Excellence
Perrigo opened its first manufacturing facility in Allegan, Michigan in 1921 and signed its first, large private-label customer in the mid-1930s, paving the way for its conversion from a re-packager of home remedies to a manufacturer of affordable health care products. This shift in strategic direction drove Perrigo's growth over the next several decades and became the foundation for the Company's mission today.
A Growing Business
Perrigo's growth was driven further by the advent of Rx-to-over-the-counter ("OTC") switches, where prescription products began to become available over the counter. These Rx-to-OTC switches provided Perrigo with opportunities to launch new store brand versions of products such as Advil®, Tylenol®, Flonase®, Allegra®, Prilosec®, Nicorette® and many more. The store brand concept also began to gain popularity with retailers seeking to improve profitability and increase customer loyalty.  
As Perrigo's consumer healthcare presence continued to expand, the Company began to pursue partnerships and acquisitions of established businesses in order to expand its geographic footprint and product offerings. In 1997, Perrigo completed its first acquisition outside of the U.S. when it acquired Quimica y Farmacia (also known as Quifa), a Mexican-based private label OTC company. Perrigo then expanded further by adding businesses in the U.K. and Australia, which provided the company access to important new markets across the globe. 
Perrigo's product portfolio expanded in 2005 with the addition of Agis Industries, which added a number of generic prescription pharmaceutical products, primarily focused on difficult to manufacture topical foams, lotions and gels.  Over the subsequent years, the addition of new store brand OTC categories such as infant formula and animal health solidified Perrigo as a global leader in Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. 
In 2013, Perrigo acquired Elan Corporation plc, which provided a platform for further global expansion. In 2015, Perrigo completed the acquisition of Belgium-based Omega Pharma NV, one of the largest OTC healthcare companies in Europe. This addition to the Perrigo portfolio added a pan-European-based organization focused on providing high-quality branded OTC products to consumers in approximately 30 countries.
Today
Today, Perrigo is a leading global healthcare company, focused on providing value to its customers and consumers by delivering Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. Perrigo has built a unique business model that is best described as the convergence of a fast-moving consumer goods company, a high-quality pharmaceutical manufacturing organization and a world-class supply chain network. Perrigo is the world's largest manufacturer of OTC healthcare products and supplier of infant formulas for the store brand market. The Company also is a leading provider of branded OTC products throughout Europe and the U.S., as well as a leading producer of "extended topical" prescription drugs. Perrigo, headquartered in Ireland, sells its products primarily in North America and Europe, as well as in other markets, including Australia, Israel and China.

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]
In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire US national distributor of over-the-counter medicines, Geiss, Destin & Dunn[24]

For all the attention paid to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), it’s the S&P 500 that’s relied on by insiders and institutional investors. It represents the industry standard for American 
large-cap indices.


The Dow is made up of just 30 stocks to the S&P 500’s 500, and it uses an unreliable and outdated price-weighting system where the S&P 500 relies on market cap in weighting its returns. This is why 
its long-term returns is a much more reliable gauge for the performance of large- and mega-cap stocks over time.

While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases; future impairment charges; the success of management transition; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; potential third-party claims and litigation, including litigation relating to the Company's restatement of previously-filed financial information; potential impacts of ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; general economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the consummation of announced acquisitions or dispositions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; the Company's ability to achieve its guidance; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other initiatives.  In addition, the Company may identify and be unable to remediate one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may incur additional tax liabilities in respect of 2016 and prior years as a result of any restatement or may be found to have breached certain provisions of Irish company legislation in respect of prior financial statements and if so may incur additional expenses and penalties. These and other important factors, including those discussed under 'Risk Factors' in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]
In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire US national distributor of over-the-counter medicines, Geiss, Destin & Dunn[24]

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]
In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire US national distributor of over-the-counter medicines, Geiss, Destin & Dunn[24]

History[edit]
The L. Perrigo Company was founded in 1887 in Allegan, Michigan, by Luther and Charles Perrigo, who ran a country general store .[3] In 1991 Perrigo had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Mori Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company.[4]
In April 2015, Perrigo received a buy-out offer from Mylan for a fee of $29 billion.[5] In May 2016 Perrigo investors sued the company over misleading statements made during Mylans hostile takeover attempt.[6] Those false statements are said to have persuaded shareholders to vote against the deal.[7][8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On 9 January 2008, the firm acquired Galpharm Healthcare, Ltd., a supplier of over-the-counter store brand pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.[9] On 16 September 2008, the firm acquired J.B. Laboratories.[10] On 6 October 2008, it acquired Laboratorios Diba S.A., enabling the company to market its products in Mexico.[11] On 13 November 2008, it acquired Unico Holdings, a manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas and feminine hygiene products for retail consumers in the U.S.[12]
On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand.[13] On 23 March 2010, it acquired PBM Holdings, Inc.,a producer of over-the-counter store brand infant formula and baby foods in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.[14]
On 20 January 2011, the firm announced that it would acquire Paddock Laboratories Inc., with the deal expected to close in fiscal 2012.[15]
In September 2012, Perrigo announced its intention to enter the animal wellness category by acquiring the assets of Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of over-the-counter companion animal healthcare products.[16]
On 11 February 2013, Perrigo announced the completion of the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations.[17] On 29 July 2013, the firm announced that it would acquire Élan, a major drugs firm based in Dublin.[18][19] The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.[20]
In November 2014, Perrigo announced it had agreed to buy Belgian health-products provider Omega Pharma approximately $4.5 billion(€3.6 billion).[21][22] The transaction was completed in March 2015.[23]
In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire US national distributor of over-the-counter medicines, Geiss, Destin & Dunn[24]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
