Swartzman E, Silverman M, Meighen EA.. The luxR gene product of Vibrio harveyi is a transcriptional activator of the lux promoter. J Bacteriol 174: 7490-7493Article · December 1992 with 8 ReadsSource: PubMed1st E Swartzman2nd M.R. Silverman3rd EA MeighenAbstractExpression of the lux operon from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi is dependent on cell density and requires an unlinked regulatory gene, luxR, and other cofactors for autoregulation. Escherichia coli transformed with the lux operon emits very low levels of light, and this deficiency can be partially alleviated by coexpression of luxR in trans. The V. harveyi lux promoter was analyzed in vivo by primer extension mapping to examine the function of luxR. RNA isolated from E. coli transformed with the Vibrio harveyi lux operon was shown to have a start site at 123 bp upstream of the first ATG codon of luxC. This is in sharp contrast to the start site found for lux RNA isolated from V. harveyi, at 26 bp upstream of the luxC initiation codon. However, when E. coli was cotransformed with both the lux operon and luxR, the start site of the lux mRNA shifted from -123 to -26. Furthermore, expression of the luxR gene caused a 350-fold increase in lux mRNA levels. The results suggest that LuxR of V. harveyi is a transcriptional activator stimulating initiation at the -26 lux promoter.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text
CitationsCitations78ReferencesReferences22Activated receptor kinases transfer their phosphate molecule to LuxU which again transfers the phosphate group to LuxO (Lenz et al. 2004; Plener et al. 2015). The up-regulated LuxO then activates several other genes and ultimately blocks LuxR mRNA that is responsible for transcription of luciferase gene (Swartzman et al. 1992; Wannamaker 2013). On the other hand, at high cell density, inducer molecules bind to membrane receptor and inactivate its autophosphorylation and thus act as a phosphatase. The talking language in some major Gram-negative bacteria[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Cell-cell interaction or quorum sensing (QS) is a vital biochemical/physiological process in bacteria that is required for various physiological functions, including nutrient uptake, competence development, biofilm formation, sporulation, as well as for toxin secretion. In natural environment, bacteria live in close association with other bacteria and interaction among them is crucial for survival. The QS-regulated gene expression in bacteria is a cell density-dependent process and the initiation process depends on the threshold level of the signaling molecule, N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). The present review summarizes the QS signal and its respective circuit in Gram-negative bacteria. Most of the human pathogens belong to Gram-negative group, and only a few of them cause disease through QS system. Thus, inhibition of pathogenic bacteria is important. Use of antibiotics creates a selective pressure (antibiotics act as natural selection factor to promote one group of bacteria over another group) for emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria and will not be suitable for long-term use. The alternative process of inhibition of QS in bacteria using different natural and synthetic molecules is called quorum quenching. However, in the long run, QS inhibitors or blockers may also develop resistance, but obviously it will solve some sort of problems. In this review, we also have stated the mode of action of quorum-quenching molecule. The understanding of QS network in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria will help us to solve many health-related problems in future.Article · Apr 2016 Goutam BanerjeeArun Kumar RayReadThe autoinducers are detected at the cell surface by distinct membranebound histidine sensor kinase proteins that feed a common phosphorylation ⁄ dephosphorylation signal transduction cascade controlling the production of the quorum-sensing master regulator protein LuxR (Taga & Bassler 2003). LuxR directly activates the Lux operon (Swartzman et al. 1992), whereas most of the other genes are controlled indirectly (Waters & Bassler 2007). Pathogenesis, virulence factors and virulence regulation of vibrios belonging to the Harveyi clade[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The Harveyi clade or core group of the Vibrio genus includes both pathogenic and non‐pathogenic bacteria. Some of the species belonging to the clade, such as Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio campbellii and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, include serious pathogens of aquatic organisms. Importantly, within these species, some strains are pathogenic, whereas others are not. Other members of the clade, such as Vibrio natriegens and Vibrio mytili are reported to be non‐pathogenic. As bacteria belonging to the Harveyi clade show a high diversity with respect to virulence and as the virulent members cause high mortalities in the aquaculture sector, it is important to understand which gene products are responsible for the pathogenicity of the bacteria and how expression of these virulence factors is regulated. This knowledge will ultimately allow for the development of biocontrol measures that aim to reduce the severe losses that are currently faced in the aquaculture sector as a result of vibriosis. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of bacteria belonging to the Harveyi clade, their impact on the aquaculture sector, the virulence factors that are involved in pathogenicity and their regulation.

LuxR is the master regulator of QS target genes, and it acts as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor (Miyamoto et al., 1994;Pompeani et al., 2008;Swartzman et al., 1992). Thus, at LCD, expression of the Qrr sRNAs represses the production of LuxR and V. harveyi does not display QS behaviors. Negative Feedback Loops Involving Small Regulatory RNAs Precisely Control the Vibrio harveyi Quorum-Sensing Response[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Quorum-sensing (QS) bacteria assess population density through secretion and detection of molecules called autoinducers (AIs). We identify and characterize two Vibrio harveyi negative feedback loops that facilitate precise transitions between low-cell-density (LCD) and high-cell-density (HCD) states. The QS central regulator LuxO autorepresses its own transcription, and the Qrr small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) posttranscriptionally repress luxO. Disrupting feedback increases the concentration of AIs required for cells to transit from LCD to HCD QS modes. Thus, the two cooperative negative feedback loops determine the point at which V. harveyi has reached a quorum and control the range of AIs over which the transition occurs. Negative feedback regulation also constrains the range of QS output by preventing sRNA levels from becoming too high and preventing luxO mRNA levels from reaching zero. We suggest that sRNA-mediated feedback regulation is a network design feature that permits fine-tuning of gene regulation and maintenance of homeostasis.

Thus, at LCD, when little LuxR is present, there is no QS and V. harveyi cells act as individuals. A small RNA-mediated feedback loop controls quourm-sensing dynamics in Vibrio harveyi[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi uses a cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS) to co-ordinate behaviours in response to changes in population density. QS is accomplished through the secretion and detection of extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers. At the centre of the V. harveyi QS circuit are five small regulatory RNAs called Qrr1-5 which destabilize the mRNA of luxR, encoding LuxR, the master transcriptional regulator of QS target genes. Here we show that LuxR directly activates transcription of qrr2, qrr3 and qrr4, leading to the rapid downregulation of luxR. The LuxR-binding sites in the promoters of qrr2, qrr3 and qrr4 were identified and mutated to determine the consequences of this regulatory loop on QS dynamics. Disruption of the loop delays the transition from high to low cell density, and more significantly, decreases the cell density at which the population reaches a quorum. Our results suggest that feedback is essential for optimizing the dynamics of the transitions between individual and group behaviours.

LuxR Vh directly activates the lux operon (Swartzman et al., 1992), whereas the majority of other quorum sensing-regulated genes appears to be indirectly controlled by LuxR Vh (Waters and Bassler, 2007). Tu and Bassler (2007) recently proposed that the multiple small regulatory RNAs function to translate increasing autoinducer concentrations into a precise gradient of LuxR Vh , resulting in a gradient of expression of quorum sensing-regulated target genes. Quorum sensing and quorum quenching in Vibrio harveyi[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Luminescent vibrios, bacteria belonging to the species Vibrio harveyi and closely related species, are important pathogens in aquaculture that can affect almost all types of cultured animals. Due to large-scale use of antibiotics, many luminescent vibrios have acquired (multiple) resistance, which render antibiotic treatments ineffective. One of the alternative strategies that has recently been developed to control infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the disruption of quorum sensing, bacterial cell-to-cell communication. The quorum sensing system of V. harveyi has been studied quite intensively in vitro. Recent studies have been directed towards understanding the impact of quorum sensing and quorum sensing disruption on the virulence of luminescent vibrios towards different host organisms in vivo. This mini-review aims at discussing the current knowledge of quorum sensing in luminescent vibrios in vivo. Subsequently, quorum quenching by halogenated furanones is discussed and finally, some directions for further research are presented.

LuxR directly activates the lux operon and directly or indirectly controls all other known quorum-sensing target genes (Showalter et al. 1990; Swartzman et al. 1992). The molecular events connecting LuxO to downstream target gene expression have been characterized recently in the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which is related to V. harveyi. Multiple small RNAs act additively to integrate sensory information and control quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Quorum sensing is a cell-cell communication mechanism that bacteria use to collectively regulate gene expression and, at a higher level, to coordinate group behavior. In the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, sensory information from three independent quorum-sensing systems converges on the shared response regulator LuxO. When LuxO is phosphorylated, it activates the expression of a putative repressor that destabilizes the mRNA encoding the master quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator LuxR. In the closely related species Vibrio cholerae, this repressor was revealed to be the RNA chaperone Hfq together with four small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) called Qrr1-4 (quorum regulatory RNA). Here, we identify five Qrr sRNAs that control quorum sensing in V. harveyi. Mutational analysis reveals that only four of the five Qrrs are required for destabilization of the luxR mRNA. Surprisingly, unlike in V. cholerae where the sRNAs act redundantly, in V. harveyi, the Qrr sRNAs function additively to control quorum sensing. This latter mechanism produces a gradient of LuxR that, in turn, enables differential regulation of quorum-sensing target genes. Other regulators appear to be involved in control of V. harveyi qrr expression, allowing the integration of additional sensory information into the regulation of quorum-sensing gene expression.

Abstract
The INK4a gene encodes two distinct growth inhibitors - the cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p16(Ink4a), which is a component of the Rb pathway, and the tumor suppressor p19(Arf), which has been functionally linked to p53. Here we show that p19(Arf) potently suppresses oncogenic transformation in primary cells and that this function is abrogated when p53 is neutralized by viral oncoproteins and dominant-negative mutants but not by the p53 antagonist MDM2. This finding, coupled with the observations that p19(Arf) and MDM2 physically interact and that p19(Arf) blocks MDM2-induced p53 degradation and transactivational silencing, suggests that p19(Arf) functions mechanistically to prevent MDM2's neutralization of p53. Together, our findings ascribe INK4a's potent tumor suppressor activity to the cooperative actions of its two protein products and their relation to the two central growth control pathways, Rb and p53.

See comment in PubMed Commons belowBiochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Nov 30;189(1):551-7.The MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein, mediates the transport of the cardiac glycoside, digoxin.de Lannoy IA1, Silverman M.Author information1Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.AbstractDigoxin, a widely used cardiac glycoside with a low therapeutic index, is known to interact with a large and diverse group of co-administered drugs, frequently leading to toxic accumulation of the glycoside. Establishing the mechanism(s) of these interactions, therefore, has potential clinical significance. The present studies implicate P-glycoprotein, the MDR1 gene product overexpressed in multidrug resistant cells, as the apical membrane protein responsible for the renal secretion of digoxin and provide an explanation for the occurrence of digoxin toxicity in the presence of certain co-administered medications. Since digoxin is considered a prototype for endogenous digitalis-like glycosides, the results also allow for speculation that endogenous digitalis-like glycosides may be the natural substrates for P-gp.PMID: 1360207  [Indexed for MEDLINE] SharePublication types, MeSH terms, SubstancesPublication typesComparative StudyResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tMeSH termsAnimalsBiological Transport/drug effectsCHO CellsColchicine/pharmacology*CricetinaeCyclosporine/pharmacologyDigoxin/metabolism*Dose-Response Relationship, DrugDrug Resistance/genetics*KineticsMembrane Glycoproteins/geneticsMembrane Glycoproteins/metabolism*P-GlycoproteinQuinidine/pharmacologyVerapamil/pharmacologyVinblastine/metabolism*SubstancesMembrane GlycoproteinsP-GlycoproteinVinblastineDigoxinCyclosporineVerapamilQuinidineColchicineLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesElsevier ScienceOther Literature SourcesCited by Patents in - The LensMiscellaneousDIGOXIN - Hazardous Substances Data BankQUINIDINE - Hazardous Substances Data BankCOLCHICINE - Hazardous Substances Data BankVINBLASTINE - Hazardous Substances Data BankVERAPAMIL HYDROCHLORIDE - Hazardous Substances Data BankCYCLOSPORIN A - Hazardous Substances Data BankOMIM: Data: Gene Annotation - SciCrunchPubMed Commons home

See comment in PubMed Commons belowJ Bacteriol. 1992 Nov;174(22):7490-3.The luxR gene product of Vibrio harveyi is a transcriptional activator of the lux promoter.Swartzman E1, Silverman M, Meighen EA.Author information1Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.AbstractExpression of the lux operon from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi is dependent on cell density and requires an unlinked regulatory gene, luxR, and other cofactors for autoregulation. Escherichia coli transformed with the lux operon emits very low levels of light, and this deficiency can be partially alleviated by coexpression of luxR in trans. The V. harveyi lux promoter was analyzed in vivo by primer extension mapping to examine the function of luxR. RNA isolated from E. coli transformed with the Vibrio harveyi lux operon was shown to have a start site at 123 bp upstream of the first ATG codon of luxC. This is in sharp contrast to the start site found for lux RNA isolated from V. harveyi, at 26 bp upstream of the luxC initiation codon. However, when E. coli was cotransformed with both the lux operon and luxR, the start site of the lux mRNA shifted from -123 to -26. Furthermore, expression of the luxR gene caused a 350-fold increase in lux mRNA levels. The results suggest that LuxR of V. harveyi is a transcriptional activator stimulating initiation at the -26 lux promoter.PMID: 1385389 PMCID: PMC207451  [Indexed for MEDLINE] Free PMC ArticleSharePublication type, MeSH terms, SubstancesPublication typeResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tMeSH termsBacterial Proteins/genetics*Bacterial Proteins/metabolismBase SequenceGenes, Bacterial*Molecular Sequence DataOperon*Promoter Regions, Genetic*RNA, Bacterial/geneticsRNA, Bacterial/isolation & purificationRNA, Messenger/geneticsRNA, Messenger/isolation & purificationRepressor Proteins*Restriction MappingTrans-Activators*Transcription Factors/genetics*Transcription Factors/metabolismTranscription, Genetic*Vibrio/genetics*SubstancesBacterial ProteinsRNA, BacterialRNA, MessengerRepressor ProteinsTrans-ActivatorsTranscription FactorsLuxR autoinducer binding proteinsLinkOut - more resourcesFull Text SourcesHighWire - PDFEurope PubMed CentralPubMed CentralPubMed Central CanadaOther Literature SourcesCOS Scholar UniversePubMed Commons home
