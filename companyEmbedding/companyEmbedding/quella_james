About — Q Farms
































































 We're All About Protein Q Farms is a pasture based protein farm in the hills of northwestern Connecticut's Housatonic river valley. We currently raise cattle, pigs, chickens, bees, goats and have a 2000+ tree walnut, hazelnut and chestnut orchard.Our goal is to provide people a diverse, healthful, and regionally appropriate way of meeting their protein needs. 







We believe that a sustainable lifestyle requires us to have a diverse range of protein sources to meet our health needs while protecting the environment and respecting the plants and animals that provide these nutrients to us. We believe that when an animal has healthy food, clean water, pastures to roam, and thoughtful husbandry, they will thrive and produce the highest quality meat. We do not use any chemicals on our farm - no synthetic pesticides, fertilizers or non-therapeutic antibiotics.  This compels us to have a diverse group of animals and plants that ensure that there is a depth and breadth of diversity to replicate what nature does best.  We seek to create a vibrant ecosystem on our farm that allows all of our plants and animals to thrive.







We are impassioned by husbandry, and care deeply deeply of the well being of our animals from birth to processing. We have a USDA certified poultry processing facility on-site, where we process our own birds.  We are committed to humane processing, and work with other facilities that hold the same values for animals we can't process here.  We will continue to add sources of protein to our farm over time.  We are planning to add beans, seeds, sheep, and other protein rich foods.Together, with our community, we believe we can build a sustainable, viable farming business. We will work to stay connected with you, our customers, provide education on the most delicious and sensible ways to prepare our products, and always be open to feedback and conversation about our products and practices, which ultimately, we hope will improve our lives, our plates, our community and our local ecology.The Team







James QuellaJames was born and raised in Chicago and then moved to Southeast Asia and the Near East for nearly a decade.   In the early '80s, he returned to New York City where he had a 30-year business career, culminating in being a senior managing director and partner at Blackstone, James is pursuing his next chapter with Linda building a sustainable agricultural enterprise at Q Farms. James’ responsibilities includes support for poultry on pasture, beekeeping and sales and marketing.







Linda QuellaLinda grew up in Northern California.  After college, she found her way to New York City and had a successful career as a CFO working for a multi-billion dollar company.  Feeling the need to learn something new and get back to her roots and her passion for animals, she and her husband conceived the idea of starting a farm.  At Q Farms, Linda is focused on the care and well-being of our pigs and is also the farm accountant.







Dan CarrDan manages all aspects of Q farms, and is the farm's USDA poultry processing facility supervisor.Dan grew up on the front range of Colorado.  After graduating from the University of Montana with a degree in history in 2005 Dan spent one year working on a variety of different farms in Europe. Afterwards, Dan was an Peace Corps volunteer in a remote village in northern Malawi for three years, where he learned how to keep honey bees from a local village headman named Bwana Mgogoninga. After the Peace Corps he was an assistant livestock manager and the head beekeeper at Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, NY for 6 years before landing in beautiful northwestern Connecticut with Q Farms. Dan manages all aspects of Q farms, and is the farm's USDA poultry processing facility supervisor.







Shona Sanford-LongShona is the assistant manager of Q Farms, with her primary focus on the cattle and the crops.Shona grew up on Luna Bleu Farm, a small diversified organic farm in central Vermont. While studying biology at Middlebury College Shona became interested in returning to agriculture, and started by spending six months at Essex Farm. At Essex Shona learned and then managed the slaughter and butchering of their livestock and assisted the livestock manager in all areas of animal care, as well as spending time working in the dairy, with draft horses, and in the vegetable fields.Shona left Essex to spend four months furthering her butchering knowledge at Marlow and Daughters in Brooklyn, NY, and then moved again to gain a different perspective and more experience working with cattle on McAuliffe Ranch in northern New Mexico.Shona is now full time at Q Farms as an assistant manager. 







 Grant DavisGrant comes to us with a lifetime of farming and ranching experience. Raised on his grandparent’s farm and ranch in Northern Louisiana, he realized his passion for agriculture at a young age.While attending Louisiana Tech University, Grant sought out independent internships with veterinarians, equine osteopathists, botanists, master gardeners, and farm equipment technicians in order to broaden his skill set.After graduating from Louisiana Tech University with a degree in Agribusiness, Grant relocated to the great plains of Montana in order to explore a new agricultural landscape. While in ‘Big Sky Country’, he helped farmers and ranchers reach personal ag-based goals. He supported farmers in their transition from conventional to organic practices, helped ranchers reach optimal bovine nutrition and genetics within their herds, and completed ag-based infrastructure projects throughout the small town of Malta, Montana.Today, Grant is in charge of Q Farms' poultry operations and assists in all other aspects of the farm.   ContactFor any questions or general inquiries, please contact info@qfarms.net or call directly 917-855-5245

Private Equity Giants Use Size to Lean on Suppliers


				By Kevin Roose

Slide Show



A single company purchased more than 50,000 Hewlett-Packard computers last year, buying in bulk to shave millions of dollars off its costs.
But it was not General Electric, Procter & Gamble or another large, multinational conglomerate with the muscle to dictate prices to suppliers. Rather, the big buyer was the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.
Private equity firms like Blackstone are emerging as a powerful new force in the marketplace. The big investors, which collectively oversee thousands of companies, are using their size and scope to pressure suppliers, set their own prices and exert their influence in a range of industries, including health care, construction and consumer goods.
Last year, Blackstone was part of a group of companies that collectively bought 16 million reams of copy paper, 35 million FedEx shipments and 900,000 days’ worth of rental cars from National and Avis.
“We have incredible leverage,” said James A. Quella, Blackstone’s North American head of portfolio operations. “The more volume we have, the lower our prices go.”
For years, private equity firms like Blackstone have been viewed as financial alchemists who buy undervalued companies, rejigger their balance sheets and sell them for quick gain. In good times, the strategy worked. Buyout specialists could turn a tidy profit in a matter of months, without getting deeply involved in the businesses they owned.
Hence the “barbarians at the gate” stereotype, which has arisen again in recent months as the presidential election has brought the private equity debate into sharp focus. Critics of the industry have faulted Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican candidate, for his years of running Bain Capital, a large buyout firm.
The industry players have been cast as job destroyers more concerned with making money for investors than improving the companies they own. One particularly critical ad for the Obama campaign featured a company, GST Steel, that went out of business years after it was taken over by Bain Capital.
But with the financial crisis, the decline of stocks markets and the sputtering recovery, private equity has been adapting its ways. While profit remains central and layoffs can still be part of the private equity equation, buyout firms are now stuck holding on to companies longer than expected.
As a result, the firms cannot operate at arm’s length anymore and instead have had to roll up their sleeves and become full-fledged operators.
The private equity titans have huge economic influence and sway, largely because of the size of their portfolios. Blackstone owns all or part of 74 companies that employ 700,000 people and generate $117 billion in annual revenue.
Taken collectively, Blackstone’s businesses would rank as the 13th largest company by revenue, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, I.B.M. and Procter & Gamble.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another megafirm, would be No. 5 on that list with its 74 portfolio companies and $210 billion in aggregate revenue.
The Carlyle Group has investments in 200 portfolio companies, including Dunkin’ Brands and Hertz, that collectively employ around 675,000 people — more than General Motors and General Electric combined.
“Historically, private equity firms were about financial engineering,” said Jason Busch, managing director at Spend Matters, a research firm that focuses on the procurement processes of big corporations. “That’s the fairy tale story from 25 or 30 years ago. Within the last decade, there’s been more operational work to do.”
Blackstone and others are taking the cues from the likes of General Electric. Decades ago, G.E. started buying in bulk for its various businesses units, including aerospace, energy, consumer and finance.
Despite the disparate industries spread across dozens of countries, G.E. decided to make buying decisions at the corporate level, as a way to save money and bolster profits. Today, most large multinational companies adhere to a similar strategy for their supply chain, buying computers, office supplies and all types of products at a discount.
Now, private equity firms are too. Both Blackstone and K.K.R. belong to a group purchasing program called CoreTrust, which has roughly 200 member companies including TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and other private equity firms.
The program, which began in 2006, helps companies save 10 to 50 percent on common items, and even lets them stay enrolled after they are sold or taken public by their private equity owners.
“It’s just common sense,” said Todd Cooper, head of procurement for K.K.R., which uses CoreTrust for some bulk purchases. “Every company, whether I’m a manufacturer or a retailer, uses FedEx. Everybody needs laptops.”
Those savings can add up. Blackstone says it has saved $600 million since 2006 through CoreTrust, direct supplier relationships and an equity health care group, which applies the same group purchasing principles to employee health insurance plans. K.K.R. pegs its total savings at north of $700 million.
“It’s a phenomenal benefit,” said Chris Karkenny, the chief financial officer of Apria, a health care company that was acquired by Blackstone in 2008 and has since used CoreTrust to buy telecommunications equipment, office supplies and other goods. “We do just over $2 billion in revenue, but we’re getting rates that companies with $100 billion in revenue would get.”
In 2005, Mr. Quella of Blackstone recruited Gregory Beutler, a former G.E. executive, to help Blackstone drive down prices in its biggest spending categories. The two set a goal of saving $100 million a year through bulk-buying. They immediately began reaching out to the company’s suppliers, telling them that they were to treat Blackstone’s myriad businesses like one giant conglomerate, and set their prices accordingly.
“We went to U.P.S. and FedEx,” Mr. Quella said. “We said, ‘Guys, we just did an analysis: our smallest company is paying $9.95 for overnight. Our largest company is paying $6.95 for overnight. You guys charge whatever you get away with. We want one price, and we want that price to be the price you give your biggest customer.’ ”
The hardball tactic worked. “We negotiate them to the wall,” Mr. Beutler said of Blackstone’s suppliers.
Another cost-cutting tactic is the reverse e-auction. In the eBay-style process, suppliers are given a set period of time, typically an hour, to bid against one another for a large contract.
Earlier this year, when Emdeon, a medical data provider owned by Blackstone, wanted to renegotiate a contract for a type of large, 112-pound paper rolls it uses to print medical claim statements and customer bills, Mr. Beutler organized a one-hour e-auction involving four paper makers.
Mr. Quella and Mr. Beutler watched eagerly from their desks as the bids began at $47.43 a roll, then fell as companies began lowering their prices. When the auction ended, a late bid of $45.87 a roll had won out. The savings were small by group purchasing standards, only about 3 percent of a contract that averages around $3.5 million annually. But at the scale of private equity, every dollar counts.
“Ten percent of a big number is a big number,” Mr. Quella explained.
While e-auctions and other aggressive negotiating tactics save money for private equity firms, they often put suppliers in a bind: should they lose out on a large contract, or win it and make the narrowest of profit margins?
“It almost is a necessary evil,” said Anthony C. Chukumba, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets. “You want the business. But if you bid so low and then win a contract, then you have something that is only marginally profitable.”
Some large private equity firms choose not to participate in programs like CoreTrust, typically because they believe the group purchasing process strains relationships with suppliers, and requires them to micromanage companies in exchange for relatively small savings.
Private equity-owned companies, too, have raised objections to group purchasing programs, which often require them to change suppliers from the ones they have used for decades.
“It’s difficult to break companies out of their mindsets,” said Justin Hillenbrand, a partner at Monomoy Capital Partners, a midmarket private equity firm that uses a group purchasing program for its portfolio companies. “Maybe they’ve been using U.P.S. forever, and because of that U.P.S. gives them favors; maybe it delivers things at odd hours. Guess what? If my purchasing program can get FedEx for 25 percent cheaper, they’re going to switch.”
At one meeting, Mr. Quella of Blackstone said, the chief executive of a portfolio company expressed his frustration that the firm’s group purchasing plan would force him to switch the brand of toilet paper his company used in its bathrooms.
Still, group purchasing advocates defend their work as a necessary part of private equity’s fat-trimming process. Blackstone and K.K.R., rival firms in almost every sense, are now teaming up to introduce CoreTrust to Europe.
As group purchasing programs grow, they will have to tread lightly, finding a balance in getting the prices they want and not angering the companies they own, or their suppliers.
“It’s one thing to fool with the balance sheet of a company — it’s another to change its operations,” said Mr. Busch of Spend Matters. “It’s absolutely about rolling up your sleeves, but it’s about having soft hands as well.”

Poetic Beach Bash


By Angela Hu



Published Summer 2013





Linda Batson & James Quella
Gurney’s Inn in Montauk, N.Y. 
July 15, 2012
Linda Batson, 50, and James Quella, 63, had been together for twelve years, but it wasn’t until last summer that they decided to make it official. Linda, CFO at Geller & Company, and James, a senior managing director at Blackstone Private Equity, had each been married before. But now with their children grown, they were ready to embark on a new phase together. �It’s not as simple as the love we knew as young adults. It’s an enduring relationship,� says Linda, whom James refers to as his �beatific muse.� Because the groom had lived in India years ago translating Sanskrit, he chose the term sneha�which he describes as �sticky, lasting love��as the theme for their casual beach wedding at Gurney’s Inn in Montauk. Guests were given flip-flops with the word’s symbol emblazoned on the sole, so they would leave imprints of it in the sand. James began his vows reading from Keats’s love letters, and the evening culminated in a dance party beneath a white canopy overlooking the ocean. �James didn’t sit down after the dancing started,� says Linda. �It’s never too late to feel young again.�

Winemaker's Notes
Making its debut with the 2006 vintage, the name is derived from the German word for a pristine source or an artesian aquifer. This property is steeply sloped facing southwest. The site is an ancient riverbed composed of cobble and rocks interwoven with pockets of tufa (volcanic ash) that were uplifted during the last volcanic activity in the area. Quella displays an almost ethereal quality of blue fruits, graphite, and a vibrant, subtle finish.


Critical Acclaim




RP97


The Wine Advocate - "The 2007 Quella performed slightly better than I predicted last year. A magical combination of blueberry liqueur intermixed with crushed rock, spring flowers (violets?), earth, pen ink and burning ember leads to a full-bodied, majestically rich wine with a multilayered texture, silky tannins and a phenomenally long finish of over 50 seconds. This sensational 2007 should drink well for 25-30+ years. 
"




JS97


James Suckling - "This is decadent. Layers and layers of porcini mushrooms, wet forest floor, and dark fruits. Full bodied, powerful, with everything going for it. This needs at least fiave years to show its best. Pull the cork after 2015."




WS96


Wine Spectator - "A tremendous effort, firm, intense, dense and concentrated, offering a wonderful mix of mineral, fresh earth, dried currant and herb, with touches of tobacco and cedar. Full-bodied, yet at points supple given its youth, but the finish sails on and on. To be released spring 2011. Best from 2013 through 2024"




V93


Vinous / Antonio Galloni - "Good medium ruby. Very ripe, expressive scents of blueberry, blackberry, graphite and violet, plus hints of tobacco and mocha. A fat, savory wine with captivating sweetness and almost exotic liqueur-like ripeness to its black fruit flavors. Deep, rich and serious, with an element of salinity adding another dimension. Finishes with substantial dusty, building tannins, a slight warmth and impressive richness. Rating: 93(+) Points.

"




W&S92


Wine & Spirits - "This is Bond’s second vintage of Quella, from a vineyard in the eastern hills of Napa Valley. The wine’s red cherry fruit has elasticity and intriguing meatiness, though for now it’s completely cloaked in oak. The wood adds a French roast coffee spice rather than sweetness, the tannins mouthcoating and rich. This finishes with elegance and should reward several years of cellar time."

        The enduring vision at Bond is to create a portfolio of wines that are diverse in their geographic representation and "grand cru" in quality, all under the umbrella of one philosophy, one facility and one mark.  Sourced from select hillside estates, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines of Bond vividly demonstrate the range of Napa Valley's finest terroirs.

About Napa Valley
 Related Links: Shop our most popular wine from Napa Valley Shop our top rated wine from Napa Valley  It's hard not to think of Napa Valley when thinking of California wines. The region is, after all, the one that brought world recognition to California wine making. The area was settled by a few choice wine families in the 1960's who bet that the wines of the area would grow and flourish. They were right. The Napa wine industry really took off in the 1980's, when vineyard lands were scooped up and vines were planted throughout the county. A number of wineries emerged, from large conglomerates to small boutiques to cult classics. Cabernet Sauvignon is definitely the grape of choice here, with many winemakers also focusing on Bordeaux Blends. Whites are usually Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Notable Facts Within the Napa Valley lie smaller sub-AVAs that lend even more character specifics to the wines. Furthest south is Carneros, followed by Yountville, Oakville & Rutherford. Above those two is St.-Helena and finally, just granted an AVA, Calistoga. These areas are situated on the valley floor and are known for creating rich, smooth Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay. There are a few mountain regions as well, nestled on the slopes overlooking the valley AVAs. Those include Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Mount Veeder. Wines from the mountain regions are often more structured and firm, benefiting from more time in the bottle to evolve and soften.

It's not rare to see a wine's country of origin listed as "California." A country unto itself in the wine world, California makes enough varieties and styles to match many European wine countries. It produces a diverse range of wines that span the quality spectrum.
The most famous of the California wine regions is Napa Valley, and these wines are certainly outstanding – but it's not as broad and diverse as its larger neighbor, Sonoma County. Down south, Santa Barbara's Santa Maria Valley is well-known for its Rhône blends, as well as cool-climate varieties like Pinot and Chardonnay. The Central Coast, the largest California AVA, has many different microclimates that lead to a wide range of wines with many sub-AVAs.

Alcohol By Volume Guide
Most wine ranges from 10-16% alcohol by volume. Some varietals tend to have higher (for example Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon) or lower alcohol levels (Pinot Noir and many white varietals), but there is always some variation from producer to producer. Some wine falls outside of this range, for instance Port weighs in closer to 20%, while Muscat and Riesling are usually a bit below 10%.


Wine Style Guide

Light & Fruity
Red wines that are more fruit-forward and lighter in tannin and body.
Smooth & Supple
Medium bodied reds that go down easy, with smooth tannins and supple fruit.
Earthy & Spicy
Wines where earthy and/or spicy dominate the flavors – typically medium to full body.
Big & Bold
Full bodied wines that have concentrated fruit and are higher in alcohol and/or tannins. Some need age.
