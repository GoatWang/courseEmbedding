The Company's marketed products include Bone-Induction Artificial Bone (BIAB) products and Vacuum Sealing Drainage (VSD) products. Its products include VSD 1, VSD 2, VSD 3, VSD 4, VSD 5, VSD 6, Bone induction Artificial bone A1, Artificial bone A1, Bone induction Artificial bone A2, Artificial bone A2, Bone induction Artificial bone A3, Artificial bone A3, Bone induction Artificial bone A4, Artificial bone A4, Xishu Qing, Microcyn Skin and Wound Hydrogel, Incision protection sleeve and Kangfu Shengyuan.Bone-Induction Artificial BoneThe Company's BIAB is a bionic porous repairing bone material, which is made of calcium phosphate. Its composition and structure is similar with the natural mineral of human bone. It helps to absorb human self's basic metabolic panel (BMP) growth factor and also regulates gene function to induct bone regeneration. The artificial bone is used in repairing traumatic bone defects; repairing bone defect after complete removal of bone tissue as required in the treatment of certain diseases, including bone tumor, bone tuberculosis, chronic osteomyelitis, osteofibrous dysplasia, delayed union, nonunion and false joint fracture; for treatment of bone loss or bone defects caused by congenital malformation; as a filling material for spinal fusion, joint fusion and orthopedic bone grafting, and as a filling material for bone grafting fusion and decompressive laminectomy.The Company's BIAB provides three-dimensional support structure and the physical and chemical composition. It helps lead the fibrous tissue and bone marrow stromal stem cells to grow into the porous of the material, thus obtains the essential multipotent mesenchymal cells for bone formation and provides the growth support of cells.Vacuum Sealing DrainageThe Company's VSD is made of polyvinyl alcohol aqueous gelatin foam: a three-dimensional porous structure, which is non ciliated. It is hydrophilic and has thermal insulation capabilities, and has histocompatibility. VSD aids skin creation around a wound bed with vulnus. The dressing material acts as a drug carrier with bactericidal characteristics, and the gelatin protein promotes the growth of granulation. It can be used in the surgery of burns, orthopedics, trauma repair, plastic and general surgery.Cancer Detection Scanning TechnologyThe Company is also licensed to conduct research and development of BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology. The technology uses biomarkers for the early detection of cancers. BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology provides techniques and assay analysis to early detection of tumors in the latent growth phase.

JUBILANT FLAME INTERNATIONAL, LTD
(FORMERLY JIU FENG INVESTMENT HONG KONG LTD.)
NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2015 AND 2014 
 
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS 
 
Jubilant Flame International, Ltd. (the "Company") was formed on September 29, 2009 under the name Liberty Vision, Inc. The Company provided web development and marketing services for clients. On December 5, 2012, the Company disposed of its subsidiary corporation to a shareholder for a nominal sum, as well as other management operations. On December 16, 2012, the Company changed its name to Jiu Feng Investment Hong Kong Ltd. On July 24, 2013, the Company changed its business sector to the medical sector. On September 30, 2013, the Company entered into a world-wide five year licensing agreement with BioMark Technologies (Asia) Limited ("BioMark") whereby the Company is licensed to sell, market and, or, distribute certain products pertaining to the health care industry; and to conduct research and development of BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology. On May 18, 2015, the Company changed its name to Jubilant Flame International, Ltd.
 
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Basis of presentation
 
The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.GAAP").
 
Interim Financial Information:
 
Interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as promulgated in Item 210 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position as of May 31, 2015, results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the three month periods ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, as applicable, have been made. The results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K.
 
Use of estimates and assumptions
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
 



 

F-5





 
 
The Company's significant estimates include income taxes provision and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets; the fair value of financial instruments; the carrying value and recoverability of long-lived assets, including the values assigned to and estimated useful lives of office equipment; and the assumption that the company will continue as a going concern. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.
 
Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Fiscal year end
 
The Company elected February 28 as its fiscal year end date.
 
Foreign currency transactions
 
The Company applies the guidelines as set out in Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Section 830-20-35") for foreign currency transactions. Pursuant to Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in currencies other than US Dollar, the Company's reporting currency. Foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the exchange rate changes. Likewise, a transaction gain or loss (measured from the transaction date or the most recent intervening balance sheet date, whichever is later) realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the transaction is settled. The exceptions to this requirement for inclusion in net income of transaction gains and losses pertain to certain intercompany transactions and to transactions that are designated as, and effective as, economic hedges of net investments and foreign currency commitments. Pursuant to Section 830-20-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the following shall apply to all foreign currency transactions of an enterprise and its investees: (a) at the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain or loss arising from the transaction shall be measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity by use of the exchange are in effect at that date as defined in Section 830-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; and (b) at each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency or reporting currency of the recording entity shall be adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate.
 
All of the Company's operations are carried out in U.S. Dollars. The Company uses the U.S. Dollar as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency.
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
 



 

F-6





 
 
Fair value of financial instruments
 
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Paragraph 820-10-35-37") to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-1-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:
 
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
 
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
 
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
 
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses and loan payable related party, approximate their fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments.
 
Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company's long-lived assets, which include office equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
 
The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset's expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.
 
The Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company's overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant decline in the Company's stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.
 



 

F-7





 
 
The impairment charges, if any, are included in operating expense in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).
 
Commitments and contingencies
 
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. 
 
Income taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740. Under ASC 740 deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
The Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during the three months ended May 31, 2015 or 2014.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued and those issued to non-employees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable. No stock based compensation was issued or outstanding during the three months ended May 31, 2015 or 2014.
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders' equity (deficit), exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes net income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on investments in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. There were no differences between the Company's comprehensive loss and net loss for the three months ended May 31, 2015 or 2014.
 



 

F-8





 
 
Net income (loss) per common share
 
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 2660-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. There were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding during the three months ended May 31, 2015 or 2014.
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
NOTE 3 -- GOING CONCERN  
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As at May 31, 2015 the Company had current assets, comprising of cash, of $4,998 and current liabilities of $555,565 resulting in a working capital deficit of $550,567. The Company currently has no profitable trading activities and has an accumulated deficit of $957,553 as at May 31, 2015. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  
 
The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its new business plan in the medical sector on an ongoing basis. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives. 
 
NOTE 4 -- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
In support of the Company's efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.
 
As at May 31, 2015, the Company had a $165,140 loan outstanding with a shareholder of the Company. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured 
 
NOTE 5 -- INCOME TAX 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Deferred income taxes arise from the temporary differences between financial statement and income tax recognition of net operating losses. These loss carryovers are limited under the Internal Revenue Code should a significant change in ownership occur.
 



 

F-9





  
At May 31, 2015 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $448,000 which expire in 2034. The deferred tax asset of $67,000 created by the net operating loss has been offset by a 100% valuation allowance. The change in valuation allowance as of the three months ended May 31, 2015 was approximately $8,000.
 
NOTE 6 -- ACCRUED OFFICER COMPENSATION 
 
On April 17, 2013 the Company entered into Employment Agreements with its president, Ms. Yan Li and its secretary and treasurer, Mr. Robert Ireland. 
 
Ms. Li's agreement is retroactively effective as of December 4, 2012, for a term of 36 months (measured from December 4, 2013). Pursuant to the agreement, Ms. Li shall receive an annual salary of $78,000 and shall act as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
 
Mr. Ireland's agreement is retroactively effective as of December 4, 2012, for a term of 36 months (measured from December 4, 2012). Pursuant to the agreement Mr. Ireland shall receive an annual salary of $78,000 and shall act as the Company's Secretary and Treasurer.
 
As at February 28, 2015, a total of $390,000 had been accrued as compensation payable to Ms. Li and Mr. Ireland.
 
NOTE 7 -- COMMON STOCK 
 
The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.
 
No shares of common stock were issued during the three months ended May 31, 2015 or 2014.
 
Total shares issued and outstanding as at May 31, 2015 were 8,500,000.
 
NOTE 8 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
Effective June 18, 2015, Jubilant Flame International, LTD (the "Company") entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement, and a Registration Rights Agreement (collectively the "Agreements") with Premier Venture Partners, LLC, a California limited liability company (the "Investor").
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, the Investor shall invest up to Five Million U.S. Dollars ($5,000,000) to purchase the Company's common stock in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, and/or upon such other exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act as may be available with respect to any or all of the sales of shares of the Common Stock made pursuant to the Agreements. The Company has further agreed to register the shares of common stock sold to the Investor pursuant to the 1933 Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable state securities laws.
 
In accordance with ASC 855-10, "Subsequent Events", the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to May 31, 2015 to the date these financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and has determined that, other than as disclosed above, it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements

The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our net cash used in operating activities decreased by $1,924 in the three months ended May 31, 2015 compared to that in the three months ended May 31, 2014, representing a decrease of 14.2%. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a repayment of an accounts payable balance of $1,461 during the three months ended May 31, 2014 as compared to an increase in the balance of accounts payable of $425 during the three months ended May 31, 2015.

Future Financings 
 
We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months.  
 
Effective June 18, 2015, Jubilant Flame International, LTD (the "Company") entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement, and a Registration Rights Agreement (collectively the "Agreements") with Premier Venture Partners, LLC, a California limited liability company (the "Investor").
