He demonstrated very good listening skills - generally a lot of time can be wasted during audits through different people asking the same questions (and often the same person asking the same questions) whereas with Ed I got a strong feeling that he genuinely understood how our business operated as he often demonstrated the ability to logically link pieces of information together and consequently when he was audit lead it was the smoothest audit I have been through to date.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended EdwardGroupsErnst and Young AlumniView Edward’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Edward directlyView Edward’s Full ProfileNot the Edward you’re looking for?
