PARTICIPATION MATTERS
LECTURE HEAVY
GROUP PROJECTS


                  Participation does matter, the lectures are pretty boring, you don't even really need to take notes during lectures. Exams are multiple choice and short answer. The Prof. is pretty caring and understanding if you talk to him during office hours, will cut you some slack. He isn't however very clear on assignments & expectations before they are due.

                  Echo 360 quizzes every class, 3 exams, group project/ presentation, in class verbal participation, and a few assignments. Makes you talk in class to receive points so if you don't like to talk take someone else. Goes over a few key topics from each chapter during class but that's it. Use the book, online videos, & study guide to study for the exams

                  Professor Kondo is a good man and his lectures are quite fine.  Read the lecture notes to prepare for the test, I honestly didn't really read the book. Multiple choice tests & short answer. Some test questions can be tricky so know your stuff. The group project is easy and fun if you are with the right people.  Daily Echo quizzes.  Chill class.

BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES


                  not an easy A or B, no roll call attendance but participation points are accumulated over time. quizzes beginning at the beginning of every class, worth a lot of points (participation in the quizzes and correct answer.) chose wisely for the group project.  don't miss the tests makes ridiculous alternative. makes you buy expensive book/online access

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  I got a C in this class by putting in some effort. However, the tests are pretty difficult. 25 mult choice and 3 short answer questions. His lectures are pretty boring, I did best just reading the book and being there for the cengage quizzes. Participation DOES matter it is a large portion of the overall grade. Group project, 3 pt extra credit opp.

                  Watch cengage videos before each class meeting, for top hat quizzes. Bring some comfy shoes and lots of snacks, his lectures are long and boring. Gives a helpful study guide for the midterms/final. Pick a good group for your project. Overall, easy C with minimal work, an A if you put slight effort. Participation MATTERS! Sweet professor overall.

                  Great start for Marketing. Listen and pay attention in class, it's an easy A. Additionally he gives you study guides/topics to go over, simple. Group project is easy, although as usual, be aware of who is in your group. Preparation for this class is minimal, the only time i had to use my book was when i needed to know a few terms for the tests.

PARTICIPATION MATTERS
TOUGH GRADER


                  Honestly not recommended to students who are serious about their grads and learning. First off his lectures r simple and boring, second he does Not teach the things that you need on the test. Participation matters in each class of the course. Some group projects. 1 presentation per group. 2 midterm 1 final (not cumulative). Tests r extremely tricky

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  Reasons not to take this professor  1) His lectures have nothing to do with the tests he gives ( read the book to pass the test) 2) tons of top hat quizzes 3) Doesn't really teach anything ( read the book)  4) you have to have a lot of knowledge about the apple company in order to get participation points

PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  Prof Kondo is a nice guy who is genuinely passionate about the subject and is always willing to help. For the exams, just read the book (very thin, like a glossy magazine), skim the slides, and use his STUDY GUIDE. Participation is part of your grade! Overall, he grades pretty leniently.

                  Great professor. Really easy class when you attend and pay attention. One of the easiest classes of my masters but also one of the ones I learned the most in. He is just a great teacher, interesting, good heart, good advice, smart, and fun! Definitely recommend this class.

TOUGH GRADER
PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  He's really nice and I liked the class structure but honestly I wish I took this class with a different teacher. You'd think that if u aced every part of the class besides the tests you would still get a decent grade but he just wants to give everyone a C so that he can please his dept no matter how good a student u are this class will hurt ur gpa

GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK
PARTICIPATION MATTERS
INSPIRATIONAL


                  Definitely recommend Kondo for MKTG 351. The exams are tricky at first - make sure to study the TEXTBOOK and focus on definitionsconcepts. If you studyread the textbook, you will get a good grade on the exams. Group project was relatively easy. In-class participation is worth 3% of the grade. Kondo is a good teacher.

                  Class is very organized and structured.  Kondo is passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches, so he likes to get the class engaged. Not an easy A but it's not hard to get a good grade. Tests are straight forward, no surprises. He tells you what you need to know. I'm taking him again this semester because I enjoyed him and his mktg 351.

                  Great Professor!  Fairly difficult to get an A, but B's are attainable.  Tests are from a generator so all you need to know are terms and basic concepts. He relates class content to real life situations very well. Huge group project that is lengthy and time consuming so choose your group members wisely.
