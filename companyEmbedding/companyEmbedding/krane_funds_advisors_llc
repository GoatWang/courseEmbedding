ETF shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in large Creation Unit aggregations. Instead, investors must buy or sell ETF Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a stockbroker. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling. The NAV of the Fund’s shares is calculated each day the national securities exchanges are open for trading as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (the “NAV Calculation Time”). Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not NAV. Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined). Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.
		

An active secondary market for the Fund’s shares may not exist. Although the Fund’s shares will be listed on an exchange, subject to notice of issuance, it is possible that an active trading market may not develop or be maintained. There is no guarantee that distributions will be paid.

         Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time. Annualized Return is the average return gained or lost by an investment each year over a given time period.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.

ETF shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in large Creation Unit aggregations. Instead, investors must buy or sell ETF Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a stockbroker. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

About Us
An Introduction to Krane Funds Advisors
We are an asset management company focused on providing investors with strategies  to capture China’s importance as an essential element of a well-designed investment portfolio



Core Beliefs


Team


                    We are an experienced team of professionals, laser focused on providing an exceptional investment experience for our clients.
                

                   We have partnered with some of the largest asset managers in China including E Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management. Our team and partnership network includes Chinese nationals and seasoned U.S. investment professionals. We provide the local Chinese perspective to global investors. 

 

Innovative Access & Innovation


                    We are passionate about identifying and delivering groundbreaking capital market opportunities to investors throughout the world.
                

                    We have created innovative, first to market strategies based on our deep knowledge of investing. These strategies allow investors to stay ahead of global market trends and potentially exploit current inefficiencies.
                	

 

Global View


                   We believe that maintaining a global perspective across a full spectrum of asset classes is crucial in driving results.
                


We believe that if a company is  primarily doing business within a specific country, it should be included in that country's index.
We believe that emerging market stocks will outperform developed market stocks in the long term.
We believe that investing into international bonds is essential for enhancing the risk/return profile  of a portfolio including U.S. high yield, MLPs, REITs or other asset classes delivering high yields.



 

Communication


                   We pride ourselves in delivering timely, best-in-class investment insights and education.
                


We provide unique insights into China’s economy and capital markets.
We keep investors informed about important developments in the Chinese markets.



 

Importance of China


                   We believe that China will continue to grow as an essential element of a well-designed investment portfolio.
                


We believe China has become its own asset class, and as such, a well balanced China portfolio will be an important component in overall asset allocation.
We believe global institutional flows will significantly increase into the China equity and fixed income markets over the next 5 years.
We believe the political and economic relationship between the U.S. and China is the most important relationship of the 21st Century.
We believe that as China’s prominence on the world stage expands, U.S. investors will need to increase their understanding and education on China.
We believe China will successfully make the transition to a developed economy.



 

Investment Philosophy

We believe that investors should have low-cost, transparent tools to obtain intuitive exposure to China, emerging markets, and other global asset categories. We apply our expertise in global markets and indexing to help investors obtain more  complete passive market exposures and to create smart-beta investment vehicles*.  We seek to be a leading source of meaningful cost-effective diversification for global investors. 



Portfolio Solutions

We have launched ETFs across multiple asset classes and listing exchanges. Our products cover onshore equities listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as offshore equities listed on the Hong Kong, New York, and NASDAQ exchanges. In addition, we offer fixed income solutions with exposure to China’s interbank bond market. These strategies can be used to increase diversification and potentially enhance performance as a part of a balanced diversified investment portfolio.



Building Blocks

Our exchange traded funds provide the foundation for our process and are created based on a culmination of our core beliefs, investment philosophy and best thinking around how to enhance investors’ diversified portfolios. We began by focusing on China and creating components that we believe many international investors were missing from their portfolios. We have since taken our philosophy and applied it to emerging markets, offering a more complete China exposure within an emerging market ETF.
We believe that as China’s global economic influence grows, our strategies will be used as essential buildings blocks for sophisticated asset allocators. 

*Smart beta is an investment style where a manager passively follows an index designed to take advantage of perceived systematic biases or inefficiencies in the market.

About Us
An Introduction to Krane Funds Advisors
We are an asset management company focused on providing investors with strategies  to capture China’s importance as an essential element of a well-designed investment portfolio



Core Beliefs


Team


                    We are an experienced team of professionals, laser focused on providing an exceptional investment experience for our clients.
                

                   We have partnered with some of the largest asset managers in China including E Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management. Our team and partnership network includes Chinese nationals and seasoned U.S. investment professionals. We provide the local Chinese perspective to global investors. 

 

Innovative Access & Innovation


                    We are passionate about identifying and delivering groundbreaking capital market opportunities to investors throughout the world.
                

                    We have created innovative, first to market strategies based on our deep knowledge of investing. These strategies allow investors to stay ahead of global market trends and potentially exploit current inefficiencies.
                	

 

Global View


                   We believe that maintaining a global perspective across a full spectrum of asset classes is crucial in driving results.
                


We believe that if a company is  primarily doing business within a specific country, it should be included in that country's index.
We believe that emerging market stocks will outperform developed market stocks in the long term.
We believe that investing into international bonds is essential for enhancing the risk/return profile  of a portfolio including U.S. high yield, MLPs, REITs or other asset classes delivering high yields.



 

Communication


                   We pride ourselves in delivering timely, best-in-class investment insights and education.
                


We provide unique insights into China’s economy and capital markets.
We keep investors informed about important developments in the Chinese markets.



 

Importance of China


                   We believe that China will continue to grow as an essential element of a well-designed investment portfolio.
                


We believe China has become its own asset class, and as such, a well balanced China portfolio will be an important component in overall asset allocation.
We believe global institutional flows will significantly increase into the China equity and fixed income markets over the next 5 years.
We believe the political and economic relationship between the U.S. and China is the most important relationship of the 21st Century.
We believe that as China’s prominence on the world stage expands, U.S. investors will need to increase their understanding and education on China.
We believe China will successfully make the transition to a developed economy.



 

Investment Philosophy

We believe that investors should have low-cost, transparent tools to obtain intuitive exposure to China, emerging markets, and other global asset categories. We apply our expertise in global markets and indexing to help investors obtain more  complete passive market exposures and to create smart-beta investment vehicles*.  We seek to be a leading source of meaningful cost-effective diversification for global investors. 



Portfolio Solutions

We have launched ETFs across multiple asset classes and listing exchanges. Our products cover onshore equities listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as offshore equities listed on the Hong Kong, New York, and NASDAQ exchanges. In addition, we offer fixed income solutions with exposure to China’s interbank bond market. These strategies can be used to increase diversification and potentially enhance performance as a part of a balanced diversified investment portfolio.



Building Blocks

Our exchange traded funds provide the foundation for our process and are created based on a culmination of our core beliefs, investment philosophy and best thinking around how to enhance investors’ diversified portfolios. We began by focusing on China and creating components that we believe many international investors were missing from their portfolios. We have since taken our philosophy and applied it to emerging markets, offering a more complete China exposure within an emerging market ETF.
We believe that as China’s global economic influence grows, our strategies will be used as essential buildings blocks for sophisticated asset allocators. 

*Smart beta is an investment style where a manager passively follows an index designed to take advantage of perceived systematic biases or inefficiencies in the market.

CICC to take majority stake in Krane Funds Advisors


July 10, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






China International Capital Corporation Limited has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Krane Funds Advisors LLC, a U.S. asset management firm known for its China-focused exchange traded funds. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
BEIJING and NEW YORK, July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), one of China’s leading investment banking and financial services firms, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Krane Funds Advisors, LLC, (“KraneShares”) a U.S. asset management firm best known for its China focused KraneShares exchange traded funds (ETFs) and innovative China investment strategies. The strategic acquisition combines CICC’s extensive global research, investment and wealth management platforms with KraneShares’ ETF expertise.
CICC, founded in 1995 by China Construction Bank and Morgan Stanley, was the first investment bank formed through a China-US joint venture1. Today, CICC serves corporate, institutional, government, and wealth management clients in China. With deep roots and a thorough understanding of the Chinese economy, CICC is a leading financial service provider to global clients. CICC’s global shareholders include CIC, the China Sovereign Wealth Fund, GIC, a Singapore Sovereign Wealth Fund, and two global private equity firms: TPG and KKR. CICC is a public company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (3908). 





“We are a Chinese investment bank with unique international DNA,” said Mr. Mingjian Bi, Acting Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CICC. “Our entry into the U.S. asset management and ETF industry with KraneShares’ platform represents a remarkable opportunity for us to provide high quality investment products and services to our clients, including individuals, advisors, and institutions, domestically and overseas. We are excited to have this opportunity to significantly grow KraneShares and the CICC business in the United States and globally.”
Among its ETF offerings, KraneShares has established a dominant market leadership position in the China Internet sector with KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), which holds some of the most innovative global technology companies including Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent2.
Additionally, KraneShares is a leading provider of financial products and education focused on accessing China’s equity and fixed income markets. KraneShares was the first to issue an MSCI-linked China A share ETF in the United States3. The KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF (KBA) is comprised of stocks listed on the Shanghai & Shenzhen exchanges and tracks the MSCI China A International Index.
“KraneShares is proud to join forces with CICC,” said Jonathan Krane, CEO of KraneShares. “CICC and KraneShares are both singularly focused on China. We share the same mission of building a trusted bridge of financial knowledge and expertise between the United States and China. We believe the combined company will be the premier source for China investment products and research globally.”

KraneShares Launches China Internet ETF






Business Wire




Aug 1, 2013 8:30 AM EDT













 




























































  Krane Funds Advisors LLC, a provider of China-focused Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), today announced the launch on the NASDAQ of KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NASDAQ ticker: KWEB), a new ETF that provides exposure to Chinese Internet and Internet-related companies.  "KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF provides US investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to China's growing internet sector with the cost efficiencies of ETF investing," said Brendan Ahern, Managing Director of KraneShares. "We see two powerful demographic trends driving China's internet sector: since 2000, internet spending by urban Chinese has increased 14% annually, and China's rural population continues to migrate to urban areas, further fueling internet usage." Ahern cited a McKinsey & Company report that stated China E-Tailing accounted for $190 billion in sales in 2012 and could reach as much as $650 billion by 2020. Mr. Ahern went on to say “we are very fortunate to partner again with China Securities Index Co. of Shanghai, as the index provider for this ETF.”  “We believe the China Internet sector offers an excellent opportunity for US investors. There are approximately 600 million internet users in Mainland China. Chinese internet company market capitalizations now rival the largest US and global industry leaders, along with the potential for Chinese internet IPOs to come later this year, this is definitely a sector that warrants attention,” said Dr. Zhigang Ma, General Manager of China Securities Index Co.  The Fund's benchmark is the CSI Overseas China Internet Index. Krane Funds Advisors LLC, serves as the investment adviser to the Fund.  More information on KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF is available at: www.kraneshares.com/  About CSI Overseas China Internet Index  The CSI Overseas China Internet Index is designed to measure the performance of the investable universe of publicly traded China-based companies in the Internet and Internet-related sectors. The Index is comprised of companies whose primary business or businesses involve internet software and services, internet retail services, internet commercial services, internet home entertainment software, and mobile internet. The Index is generally comprised of 20-30 securities. The Index was created and is maintained by China Securities Index Co., Ltd.

 The Green Century Funds
Approach
Green Century is a leader in environmentally and socially responsible investing. Through our three-pronged approach, we offer investors the opportunity to make an impact in a way no other mutual fund family can: through investing in sustainable companies; our leading shareholder advocacy program; and our unique ownership, where 100% of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds can be used to support the environmental and public health work of our non-profit owners. 
Green Century believes that companies that seek to protect the environment by avoiding dangerous practices and policies may be more profitable in the long run since they may be likely to have less exposure to devalued or stranded carbon assets, they may avoid costly litigation, and may be better prepared for new regulatory restrictions. Green Century also believes that companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance factors and take proactive actions around public health and environmental issues may enjoy a competitive advantage in appealing to consumers concerned about a company’s commitment to sustainability, and avoid damage to their brands.
Investment Strategy
All our Funds avoid these dangerous industries and corporations:
• Fossil fuel companies
• Fossil fuel fired utilities and companies with carbon reserves
• Producers of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
• Civilian firearms and military weapons companies
• Nuclear power companies
• Companies that derive revenues from tobacco



And instead seek to invest in companies that:
• Have outstanding rankings on environmental factors, including performance on critical environmental impacts
• Apply extensive sustainability criteria throughout their supply chains
• Minimize risks to air, water and public health
• Act as socially responsible companies in the communities in which they operate
• Rank highly on governance factors
• Are environmental innovators such as energy efficiency and clean energy companies
• Are sustainable agriculture companies involved in natural and organic foods


The MSCI International Index Fund
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies in developed markets chosen for their outstanding environmental, social and governance factors.  This passively managed Fund invests in the stocks of companies included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn moreThe Equity Fund

Five Reasons to Consider Divesting from Fossil Fuels








October 16, 2013Share this page:Facebook89Twitter0LinkedIn5
Click to view PDF version
Since fall 2012, colleges, churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by these actions, individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy. This moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change, while saving for their future.
Here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies:
1. Get Your Investments in Line with Your Values
Climate  change  is  a  serious  threat  to  our  society,  and  burning  fossil  fuels  is  a  main  cause  of worsening  floods,  droughts,  and  wildfires.  Many  investors  want  to  keep  their  investments  away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate. Divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike.
2. Reduce Corporate Influence on Energy Policy

Fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations, through lobbying in  state  capitols  and  Congress.  For  years,  this  power  has  helped  thwart  progress  on  the  policy solutions to climate change. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful South African divestment campaign, and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change.
3. Strengthen the Climate Movement
Climate change is so profound, and the solutions so wide-ranging, that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference. The divestment strategy is successfully engaging the  public.  A  coordinated  and  organized  climate  change  network  –  that  includes  mayors,  church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies.
4. May Reduce Exposure to Stranded Carbon Assets
The fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal, oil, and  gas  that  –  if  extracted  and  burned  –  will  release  five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe.* If governments restrict carbon emissions, companies owning those  fossil  fuel  reserves  may  not  be  able  to  extract  and sell them. The reserves may become stranded assets, and investors may then be left with devalued assets. Divesting now  could  allow  investors  to  reduce  their  exposure  to  a possible collapse of the so-called “carbon bubble.”
5. Reinvest in the Solutions
Once  divested  from  fossil  fuels,  investors  have  the opportunity to invest in forward-looking climate solutions, like companies specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other related climate mitigation strategies.

The Green Century Balanced Fund is already fully divested from fossil fuel companies and re-invested in green solutions.
The Green Century Equity Fund is divested from coal and major oil companies, and invests in the longest running socially responsible index.
Next Steps
Each investor must decide whether divesting from fossil fuels meets his or her objectives. But every day, more investors are deciding it is the right path forward.

 Financial Advisors
Green Century values the opportunity to serve financial advisors and their clients who are interested in environmentally responsible and sustainable investments.
Unique Non-Profit Ownership That Makes a Difference
Twenty five years ago, a group of non-profit environmental leaders decided to help people save for their future without compromising their values. That means that every dime of every dollar that Green Century Capital Management earns managing our Funds belongs to state and national non-profit advocacy organizations.
Learn more about our history and ownership structure.
Investment Strategy
Green Century believes that in the long run, companies that seek to protect the environment may be more profitable than companies that do not. All Funds seek competitive returns by investing in sustainability leaders while avoiding companies that are not managing environmental risks.
