HISTORY
BRC was born in Cherasco at the end of ‘60s, as a gas systems  local dealer. At the end of ‘70s Romano Bogetti, BRC owner, decided to start the production of multivalves, a  component as important as hard to find on the market.
He came therefore to an agreement with Mariano and  Pier Antonio Costamagna, owners of M.T.M., a little workshop founded in  Cherasco in 1977: BRC trademark was officially born.
The production grown with other components and gained  more and more market shares: in the ‘80s,  the production of the complete range of LPG and CNG components started and in  1991 BRC brought on the market its first carburation control electronic system.
In 1992 Costamagna Brothers acquired BRC and created  the M.T.M. – BRC  Gas Equipment.
In 1996,  BRC Gas Equipment introduced on the market the first Italian LPG  and CNG gaseous injection system.
In 2001, by  acquiring MTE,  BRC Gas Equipment became the first  Italian trademark in completing “in-house” all the know-how necessary to  plan, develop and manufacture a product.
In 2002 BRC landed overseas creating the WMTM;  born as a joint venture with White Martins, in 2008 BRC totally acquired it, becoming so the only owner.
In 2005 BRC  started to produce CNG compressors under the brand BRC Compressors, the whole project planned and developed inside the  Research & Development technical area.
In 2006 the  big turning-point occurred: BRC Gas  Equipment and Impco, absolute  leader in USA gas fuels industrial applications, created the biggest worldwide productive pole in  the ecologic fuels sector: Fuel  System Solutions, holding quoted on Nasdaq, becoming so a  landmark in the international scenery. 
In 2007 the BRC Gas Service project started, creating an authorized network of “BRC workshops” in order to  offer more and more guarantees both to the final users and to the installers.
In 2008, in  the wake of government gas subsidies, BRC further strengthened its presence in  Italy and abroad opening in a few months new production plants for DOEM  installation near Livorno in Italy and Błonie in Poland.
In 2009, BRC acquired the Argentine  company Tomasetto Achillethat under the renewed  commercial brand TA incorporated in 2010the activity of  BRC Argentina further strengthening the presence of the group on  the South American market and leadership on the LPG and CNG worldwide market.
The same year, BRC acquired  the Canadian Fuel Maker, a company  manufacturing CNG home compression systems with different flows and dimensions;  after the acquisition the new brand BRC FuelMaker came to life, the  business unit producing home and fleet CNG refuelling appliances.
In 2011 even the automotive branch of GFI Control Systems, a society of  the American Impco, passed to BRC, while the industrial branch remained in USA.  Manufacturing and warehouse, once distributed between Italy and Netherlands,  have been completely moved to Cherasco.
In 2011 also the new trademark BRC Electronic Division came to  life. BRC entirely integrated MTE,  company of the group situated in the near town of Cavallermaggiore, producing the whole electronic  components necessary to the main BRC activity,  moving headquarter and production to Cherasco, in a new plant officially opened in February  2012.
At the beginning of 2012, BRC acquired the famous brand CUBOGAS from Dresser Wayne, a General Electric  society specialized in manufacturing and trading CNG compressors and filling  stations, allowing so MTM CNG refueling division widening its offer of products  and solutions.
In 2015 the Indian branch Rohan BRC gas equipment opened near  Ahmedabad a brand new manufacturing plant measuring 6000 sqm, giving work to 60  employees and manufacturing the main CNG conversion systems components in 3 assembly  lines. The entire project,  from development to realization of assembly lines and management information  systems, has been directly followed on site by the Italian engineers.


BRC IN ITALY AND  AROUND THE WORLD 
BRC Gas Equipment is a trademark owned by M.T.M. s.r.l., an Italian  company leader in manufacturing and marketing automotive LPG and CNG components and systems.
With sole distributors in more than 70 countries, a turnover 2015 amounting to 100 millions euros and more than 1,000 among co-workers and employees, BRC Gas Equipment holds in Italy a market share of roughly 24% for LPG systems and of more than 23% for CNG systems.
Well-known above all for its CNG and LPG conversion kits (500,000 yearly),  during the years BRC extended its offer with new businesses: CNG home, fleet  and filling stations compressors branded BRC  Compressors, BRC FuelMaker and Cubogas, electronic components and systems  as BRC Electronic Division, spare parts for regular auto maintenance  branded BRC Car Service. BRC also  appears in the racing world with as BRC  Racing Team, born to develop new technologies useful for every day’s  vehicles and prove strength and reliability of its components. 
The main activity has always been the vehicles gas conversion, realizing  the serial production of bi-fuel vehicles in many installation centres on behalf of the main automobile trademarks: Chevrolet, Citroen,  Ford, Great Wall, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Piaggio,  Subaru, Suzuki, Volvo.
Moreover, BRC always cooperated in many countries of the world with: Chevrolet, Daimler, Ford, Great Wall, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, MAN, Maruti-Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Gruppo PSA, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen.
Research &  Development Dept. has always been the  BRC Gas Equipment drawing power, assuring BRC products an excellent performance  and a low impact on the environment. This is the department that created the first Italian LPG and CNG gaseous injection system and the first gaseous  injection system for vehicles with petrol direct supply.
Thanks to its widespread presence  on territory, BRC Gas Equipment has become a landmark in Italy and abroad;  its large network of dealers and workshops allows giving the final user an immediate, constant and highly qualified  assistance.
The BRC  Gas Service project, having morethan 500 specialized workshops, further improves  the offer to the customers  with a wide range of additional technical and commercial services. 
Moreover, since many years, BRC Gas  Equipment periodically organizes training and technical updating courses addressed to the installers.
BRC recently strengthened  its presence on territory with the BRC Car Service network, already having 250 workshops specialized in the spare parts field of regular auto maintenance.
The historical plants are seated in  Cherasco (Piedmont – Italy), having roughly 600 employees and a covered area of more than 50,000 sqm on 9 production areas. 

THE NUMBERS OF BRC GAS EQUIPMENT
BRC is in more than 70 countries.
It holds in Italy a market share of roughly 24% for LPG systems and of more than 23% for  CNG systems.
It employs, among co-workers and employees, roughly 1,000 people, all over the world.
The historical plants of Cherasco  have roughly 600 employees and a covered area of more than 50,000 sqm on 9 production areas.
The turnover 2015 amounts to 100 millions euros.
It produces 500,000 kits for CNG and LPG conversion every  year.
5 are the assembly lines of DOEM installation centres where serial production of  bi-fuel vehicles is carried out on behalf of the main automobile trademarks.
1 Research & Development center, where  compatibility between systems and car models is verified. 
It employs the 10% of its own workforce in Research &  Development.
Today in Italy more than 500 workshops belong  to the BRC Gas Service network and 250 workshops belong to the BRC Car Service one.
It is the first in Italy in completing  “in-house” all the know-how necessary to plan, develop and manufacture a  product.

PRODUCTIVE PHILOSOPHY AND BRC TECHNOLOGIES 
Basis of the BRC Gas Equipment success has been the  special strategic choice – first trademark of this sector in doing it – that  brought to the in-house  integration of the whole know-how necessary to plan and develop  every LPG and CNG conversion component such as, especially, changeover switches  and carburation ECUs (electronic control unit).
Research  & Development department has always been very important for the BRC Gas Equipment  success; it represents roughly a 10% of workforce among technicians and engineers and is subdivided into mechanical  and electronic sections. They work every day to create new systems to get better  performances and assure the respect of environment, operating in the field of mechanical and electronic planning and study of prototypes, productive lines study, production  industrialization and productive  process engineering and technical assistance.
In confirmation of the importance given to research, in 2011, on a 4,000 Sqm surface, BRC R&D Center opened, the new research &  development centre where innovative work instruments already used,  such as CAD-3D drawing systems of the latest  generation, laboratories  for static and dynamic tests, different kind of vehicle and emission  test benches equipped with modal analysis systems, converged together with the newest and most sophisticated equipment and technology came from Japan, Germany and Italy:

environmental chamber at controlled temperature and humidity
thermal shock and salt fog chambers
fluid dynamic benches equipped for any kind of duration and working  cycles
electro-dynamic vibration bench
engine dynos and chassis dynos

Even in the new  plant of 6,000 sqm, where the BRC Electronic Division is situated from 2012, the  investment in technology has been strong: the company has the most  sophisticated SMT conventional THT/PTH  technology equipment, modern automatic  assembly and ICT/FCT test lines,  in order to assure the best results in this field too.
Research always  grows and improves. This is the reason why, in 2010, BRC decided for a new  challenge: giving birth to a specific R&D area dedicated to the direct  study on track of new technologies, the  “BRC Racing Team”,  a real and complete BRC branch including professional technicians and drivers,  with the aim to find  new technologies for every day’s vehicles, show the equivalent performances of gas and petrol supply, and demonstrate the resistance of components regularly used for gas systems to the most extreme conditions, just as in case  of races.
Target is  reached. The Team makes many important débuts in the world of races, getting  excellent results in different championships with a Nissan 350Z GT, 3.500 cc, 6-cyl, 350  hp, LPG monofuel, a Seat Leon LPG, the Montecarlo BRC GT W12, unique  prototype created in cooperation  with Montecarlo Automobile, and a LPG Swift Sport 1600 lined up at Suzuki Rally Cup.
In 2013 BRC promoted the Green Hybrid Cup, first international series with LPG-electric hybrid  cars, evolution of Green  Scout Cup, the Italian Championship of Alternative Energy born in 2011 thanks to the  cooperation between BRC gas equipment and Kia Motors Italia,  which offered the 15 Kia Venga 1.6 that run the cup. In 2016 the Championship will further  develop by taking part to some races of the Italian Hill Climb Championship.
Starting from  2014, the Team also faces the Rally Italian Championship with aLPG  Ford Fiesta R5, proving the high level of reliability and performance of  BRC systems compared to the official petrol vehicles competing for the big car  manufacturers. Giandomenico Basso, driving the car, becomes Italian vice-champion  both in 2014 and 2015.

Consumer Products
Helping you consistently produce safe, quality and legal products that meet customer requirements






OverviewThe new issue of the Consumer Products Standards Issue 4 in 2016 has been fully revised to:

Recognise the diversity of products included within Consumer Products


Align the Standard with the actual buying expectations of specifiers whilst encouraging continuous improvement


Simplify the requirement and terminology to make it easier to understand


Widen the scope to include products for wholesale sale and components/raw materials


Ensure that requirements were risk based


Introduce an entry Foundation level and Higher level to encourage continuous improvement

 
To achieve these objectives we have divided Consumer Products into two separate Standards

Global Standard for Consumer Products – General Merchandise


Global Standard for Consumer Products – Personal Care and Household

 
Each of the Standards can be certificated at either Foundation Level or at Higher level. This enables both flexibility to reflect customer’s needs depending on the product sector and product /brand risk and provides a clear pathway for continuous development.
The Standards have been developed by groups of industry experts to ensure they are rigorous and detailed but clearly focused on the key issues to produce safe, legal products in accordance with customer quality requirements. The Standards provide a framework to manage product safety, integrity, legality and quality, and the operational controls for these criteria.
Both Standards focus on

The importance of management commitment
Product risk assessments to ensure the products design is safe and legal before production
Process risk assessment as a tool to ensure that potential issues in the production of the products have been understood, prioritized and effectively managed
The design and maintenance of the factory and production environment to ensure this is suitable to manufacture and protect products from contamination
An effective product testing and sampling process

 
What’s in the Consumer Products Standards?
 
Both the General Merchandise and Personal Care and Household Standards have the same overall structure and are divided into seven sections:
 
1. Senior Management Commitment
 
Consistent product safety is the responsibility of everyone within the company, however, the starting point for an effective product safety plan is the commitment of senior management to the implementation of the Standard and continual development. This includes providing adequate resources, effective communication, system reviews, actions taken and opportunities for improvement
 
2. Product Risk Management
 
The first step in supplying safe and legal products is to ensure the design or formulation meets legal requirements is safe for the consumer to use and will not fail in the expected life of the product. This section looks at understanding legislative requirements and the process of testing products safety and legality and the suitability of intended product packaging before starting to manufacture
3. PRODUCT SAFETY AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 
This section sets out the requirements for the management of product safety and quality and draws on many of the principles found in ISO Standards. This includes requirements for product specifications, supplier approval, traceability, and the management of incidents and product recalls
 
4. Site Standards
 
This section sets out expectations for the production environment including the layout and maintenance of the buildings and equipment, cleaning, pest control and waste management
 
5. Product inspection and testing
 
Identifies requirements for product testing, sampling and maintenance of reference samples
 
6. PROCESS CONTROL
 
Based on the principles of Hazard and risk assessment this section looks at how the manufacturing process is managed and controlled to ensure production of consistently safe and legal products to the expected quality. This includes contamination controls, control of the packing operation and product release
 
7. Personnel
 
This section sets out the standards needed for staff training, and where applicable protective clothing and personal hygiene
