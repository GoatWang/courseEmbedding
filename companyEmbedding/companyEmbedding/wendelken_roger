Forward Looking Statements:


      Except for historical information contained herein, the matters 
      discussed in this announcement are forward-looking statements about 
      expected future events and financial and operating results that involve 
      risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties may cause our actual future 
      results to be materially different from those discussed in 
      forward-looking statements. Our risks and uncertainties include the 
      timely development and market acceptance of new products; the impact of 
      competitive products and pricing; our ability to procure capacity from 
      our suppliers and the timely performance of their obligations, commodity 
      prices, interest rates and foreign exchange, potential investment losses 
      as a result of liquidity conditions, the effects of changing economic 
      and political conditions in the market domestically and internationally 
      and on our customers; our relationships with and dependence on customers 
      and growth rates in the personal computer, consumer electronics and 
      embedded and automotive markets and within our sales channel; changes in 
      customer order patterns, including order cancellations or reduced 
      bookings; the effects of tariff, import and currency regulation; 
      potential or actual litigation; and excess or obsolete inventory and 
      variations in inventory valuation, among others. In addition, SMSC 
      competes in the semiconductor industry, which has historically been 
      characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, 
      cyclical market patterns, price erosion and periods of mismatched supply 
      and demand.
    

      Our forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the 
      inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations and may 
      not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers or 
      divestitures. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date 
      hereof and are based upon the information available to SMSC at this 
      time. Such statements are subject to change, and the Company does not 
      undertake to update such statements, except to the extent required under 
      applicable law and regulation. These and other risks and uncertainties, 
      including potential liability resulting from pending or future 
      litigation, are detailed from time to time in the Company's reports 
      filed with the SEC. Investors are advised to read the Company's Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly those sections entitled 
      “Other Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results” or “Risk

The fully automated InnerSense SmartWafer (SMW2) system addresses these key metrics. The SMW2 system is effectively being used as a predictive monitor for handler PM’s, a leading indicator for mechanical defects and can detect, predict and prevent most mechanical related excursions, including wafer damage that can lead to subsequent wafer breakage. The SMW2 system can further improve tool availability by improving post PM recovery and tool matching.January 24, 2017Sponsored by InnerSenseMore Technology Papers
