     of CIBC World Markets Inc. or any other issuer or subsidiary of Canadian Imperial Bank of
      Commerce. The material found on the Site is not intended to constitute financial, legal, 
      tax, investment, professional or expert advice and is only intended for general circulation

    Disclosure of Interests

    CIBC Capital Markets may make a market or deal as principal in the securities, commodities or 
    instruments mentioned in materials at this site or in options or other derivative instruments
     based thereon. In addition, CIBC Capital Markets, or its shareholders, directors, officers,

    Price Information/Valuations

    Actionable prices may only be obtained on a real-time, expressly agreed upon basis.
     Any indicative valuations or estimates in materials on the Site are provided for
      informational purposes only. Any information regarding any valuations with respect

      terminate any transaction, or a commitment by CIBC Capital Markets to make such an offer. 
      Indicative valuations on the Site may vary significantly from indicative valuations

       correctness, accuracy or completeness of any indicative valuations.
    
    
    

    Hypothetical or Past Performance

   Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual
    performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the
     trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated 
     for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated 
     trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance 
     is not in any way indicative of any future results and no representation is being made 
     with respect to past performances being in any way indicative of future performance.

    All materials at this site are meant to be reviewed in their entirety, including any footnotes,
     legal disclaimers, restrictions or disclosures, and any copyright or proprietary notices.

      disclosures through use of the Site. All products or services that are provided by CIBC 
      Capital Markets are subject to the terms of any applicable agreements. Any disclaimers,

(CAM) is introducing a suite of new, lower-cost CIBC Passive Portfolios. CAM is also making changes to its investment lineup that include management fee reductions, lower investment minimums and a simplified product offering across its mutual funds lineup.CIBC Asset Management Inc. (CAM) announces changes to its investment product line-up (CNW Group/CIBC)More"Canadians are looking for value and choice when it comes to investment solutions, which is why we made a number of enhancements to our product lineup to improve cost and accessibility," says David Scandiffio , President and CEO, CIBC Asset Management. "The changes announced today are driven by our clients' changing needs."CIBC Passive PortfoliosAs part of its commitment to offer diversified solutions to Canadian investors, CAM is launching CIBC Passive Portfolios on July 31, 2017 . This new suite of portfolios is competitively priced and has been designed to meet a range of investor risk profiles. These portfolios will be available to regular and fee-based investment accounts, and to self-directed investors with accounts at CIBC Investor's Edge, a division of CIBC Investor Services Inc.Management fee reductionsTo provide additional value to Canadian investors, CAM is implementing management fee reductions of up to 40 basis points (bps) on 18 funds across its mutual fund and private pool lineup effective September 1, 2017 . These changes follow management fee reductions implemented in  September 2016 .In addition, CAM will waive a portion of its management fee or absorb certain expenses, or both, on an additional 48 funds (ranging from 5—40 bps) beginning September 1, 2017 . The decision to continue to waive management fees or absorb operating expenses is at the discretion of CAM.Lower initial investment minimums CAM is reducing the minimum initial investment on certain investment solutions.The Renaissance Private Investment Program (RPIP) will have a new minimum requirement of $100,000 , lowered from $150,000 .  Families with at least $250,000 , previously $500,000 , in one or more Renaissance Private Pools will be exempted from the minimum requirement of $100,000 per pool. The minimum initial investment for Axiom Portfolios will be reduced significantly from $25,000 to $500 . There are eight Axiom Portfolios, and each managed solution provides diversification by asset class, geographical region, investment style and market capitalization.The full details of the management fee reductions, and the minimum investment and RPIP changes effective September 1, 2017 , can be found here. Termination of several mutual fund classes To simplify its product offer, CAM is terminating several mutual fund classes with relatively small asset size and a limited number of unitholders.Effective end of business day today, classes designated for termination will be closed to new purchases, including purchases through regular investment plans. These classes will subsequently be terminated on or about October 13, 2017 .  All investors of the terminating classes will be sent a written notice of the termination at least 60 days prior to October 13, 2017. Investors have the right to redeem or switch out of an affected mutual fund class up to the close of business prior to the effective date of termination and will not be required to pay any redemption fees, sales charges or other fees associated with the class termination. CAM is also capping several mutual fund classes, which will be closed to new purchases, including through regular investment plans, effective September 1, 2017 .The full details of all mutual fund classes to be terminated and capped can be found here.About CIBCCIBC is a leading Canadian-based global financial institution with 11 million personal banking and business clients.

Advice









Client Story
Paul and Lydia: We know we should be saving for our retirement, but we are unsure how to start. We need to learn more about investing so we can feel confident about our decisions. How can we start saving for our future without giving up the things we love today?"
"Because you're young, you two are in a great position to start saving for your retirement," Paul and Lydia's advisor explains with enthusiasm. "You probably won't be retiring for another 30 or 35 years. With that amount of time, even small amounts contributed regularly can grow to a substantial amount."
He suggests Paul and Lydia start with the basics: a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Their contributions are tax-deductible and may even generate a tax refund that they can put back into their RRSP or use to pay down debt. In addition, all income and earnings are tax-deferred as long as the money remains in the plan.
Paul and Lydia agree with their advisor that to balance their other priorities it's best to start off small. They know how important it is to start investing as soon as possible to give their money more time to grow. With the help of their advisor, they have identified that they can set up a CIBC Regular Investment Plan for $100 a month and plan to increase the amount over time.
To help them choose appropriate investments, their advisor uses the CIBC Investment Selector. Based on their needs, their CIBC advisor will help them build a diversified investment portfolio with the right mix of safety, income, and growth.
Thanks to their regular RRSP contributions, Paul and Lydia are confident they are on the right track -- and they are still able to enjoy the things they love today. They're looking forward to meeting with their advisor again in a year's time - to review their progress to date and make any adjustments their plan might need.

    Price Information/Valuations

    Actionable prices may only be obtained on a real-time, expressly agreed upon basis.
     Any indicative valuations or estimates in materials on the Site are provided for
      informational purposes only. Any information regarding any valuations with respect

    Hypothetical or Past Performance

   Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual
    performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the
     trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated 
     for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated 
     trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance 
     is not in any way indicative of any future results and no representation is being made 
     with respect to past performances being in any way indicative of future performance.

      Capital Markets are subject to the terms of any applicable agreements. Any disclaimers,
