Provident Investment Management Named to the 2017 FT 300This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on June 26, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
 
 



Introducing Stephanie PetersenThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on June 30, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
I would like to introduce myself as the newest member of the Provident team.  I have had the pleasure of already meeting some of our clients and look forward to meeting more in the future. Growing up, I loved a good challenge.  I challenged myself with strategic, logical, and mathematical […]
 
 



July Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on June 30, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
The unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics release.  A tightening labor market ought to push wages higher, but average hourly wage growth remains subdued at around 2.5%.  This keeps a lid on consumer spending and, in turn, also keeps inflation in check. Low […]
 
 

 

The Case for Active Investing – The Million Dollar DifferenceThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on June 26, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
Thirty years ago one rarely heard about “index funds.”  They were around, but very few people invested in them. They have become increasingly popular over the years, and for good reasons. Index funds merely copy the indexes we active managers are trying to beat.  Collectively, active managers are the market, […]
 
 



May Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on June 26, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
With the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio at approximately 17.5x, stocks continue to trade at an elevated multiple relative to the 25-year average of just under 16.0x.  Per usual, the current environment includes reasons for both optimism and pessimism.  On the positive side for markets, earnings are growing, the Trump […]
 
 

 

The Benefits of Saving and Investing EarlyThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on April 5, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
For many young adults, the idea of saving and investing for the future is easier said than done.  It is a challenge to contemplate retirement when you are young and your focus is on starting a career rather than ending one.  However, saving and investing, as with most things in […]
 
 



April Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on April 5, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
As investors are well aware, the post-election rise in the S&P 500 has reached double-digit proportions in just over four months.  Recently, we have noticed media speculation that the bull market must be coming to an end since individual investors are “euphoric” over stocks.  Many market professionals sneer that individual […]
 
 

 

Introducing James SkubikThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on March 9, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
We are pleased to introduce our newest investment professional, James Skubik.  James has served as an equity analyst for two local investment firms.  He has also worked with JPMorgan Chase in the structuring of asset-backed securities.  We hired James out of 400 resumes received because of his deep analytical abilities, […]
 
 



March Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on March 9, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
We have just come through a very strong Q4 “earnings season,” the time of year when companies report their quarterly year-end financial results.  According to FactSet Earnings Insight, authored by John Butters, with 71% of S&P 500 companies reporting as of February 10, the market’s blended sales and earnings growth […]
 
 

 

The True Cost of IndexingThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on February 9, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
In the past few years I’ve met quite a few index investors who want to lecture me about why indexing is the one and only smart way to invest.  Their smug superiority is really starting to get to me. Indexing is a good way to invest, but it’s certainly not […]

Clients 


Who Chooses Provident Investment Management?
Most of our clients are regular people and regular families. That’s different from many other investment advisors, who prefer dealing with big institutional accounts. It’s always been that way here, ever since Ralph and Maury opened up shop with a single client in 1981. Today, Provident Investment Management has nearly 300 client relationships, for whom we manage over 600 accounts.
Our clients come from all over the country. Many also managed their own investments for years, before hiring Provident so they could focus on leisure or other activities in retirement.
What types of investors choose Provident Investment Management?

Investors who want capital growth.
Investors who need to strike the right balance between maximizing returns and being smart about taxes.
Investors who want individual stocks and bonds, not just a heap of funds.
Investors who expect to be able to talk to their money manager whenever they need to, not just by appointment.
Investors who think money managers should work in an office, not on a golf course.

Why do they choose Provident Investment Management?

For our Professional Expertise
All our Portfolio Managers are Chartered Financial Analysts.
For our Proven Record
Most firms try to hide their performance results. We like to lead with ours. You should insist on seeing five or ten years of performance data from a firm before you choose. View our investment performance.
For Peace of Mind
Our firm has been here since 1981, and we have a demonstrated record of investment success. We’ve survived the bubbles, the market fads, the economic dips, and the crises.
For our Style
Most firms specialize in growth OR value investing, but Provident looks for the synthesis of both. Many larger firms exclusively invest their clients’ money in large-capitalization stocks. While we’ll buy big companies when we think we see an opportunity, the best opportunities are usually found in smaller, under-the-radar firms,so that’s where we prefer to tread.

Back to top
Becoming a Client
One of our senior portfolio managers speaks with every prospective client to establish goals and expectations and to determine the suitability of investing with us. Once you become a Provident client, we build you an individual portfolio of high-quality growth stocks purchased with a value discipline. We can also manage the fixed-income portion of your portfolio using individual municipal bonds.
We manage any combination of taxable and non-taxable accounts, including trusts, as well as Traditional and Roth IRAs. Beginning with a new client usually involves managing them out of some holdings they bring to us. We pay attention to tax considerations, however.
While not financial planners, we work with you to establish your objectives and combine accounts together to meet one or more purposes, including retirement or estate planning needs. By treating all of your accounts as a combined portfolio, it becomes easier for you to see how the portfolio is meeting your objectives.
Each “combined portfolio” can typically be expected to hold roughly 20 to 30 stocks. These stocks are chosen from different industries and market capitalizations to gain the benefits of reduced volatility through diversification. We do not purchase mutual funds unless you are looking to invest cash short-term to gain market exposure, in which case we may buy an ETF that mimics a market index like the S&P 500. Over time, we sell the ETF and purchase stocks that fit our criteria.
We are long-term investors who do not try to “time” the market through rapid buys and sells, so typically our turnover is only 10% to 20% in any one year. By holding many stocks for a number of years, we allow our companies to realize their growth potential, which should be rewarded with higher share prices.
The contact form can help you get started today. Just ask, and we’ll get back to you promptly.

Back to top
How We Communicate
As a Provident Investment Management client, you will receive a personalized letter each quarter. Example: ProvidentExampleLetter
At many other firms, a single agent “owns” each account. As a Provident Investment Management client, you have access to our entire firm whenever you need us. We’re available to discuss your investments or broader financial matters, help you move money in or out of your accounts reliably and quickly, or answer any other questions you may have.

Provident’s investment performance includes all discretionary “core equity” accounts over $350,000, our published minimum account size. The accounts included in this performance calculation represent 70% of Provident’s total assets under management as of 6/30/2017. Client accounts may be excluded from our composite calculation due to the presence of client-directed securities, client requirements that they approve transactions prior to execution, or the small size of certain portfolios.
Performance is calculated on a time-weighted basis, net of fees, which is the accepted industry method. Performance includes the reinvestment of income and capital gains.
There are considerable differences between Provident’s investment style and any broad indicator of market performance such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The volatility of the S&P 500 may be materially different from that of a Provident portfolio because there are differences in portfolio structure and methodology.

February Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on February 9, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
As the market hits all time highs it is interesting to look back at the mood of investors a year ago. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark Federal Funds interest rate 0.25%, the first increase since 2006.  It was expected that several more rate hikes would occur […]
 
 

 

New Year’s Resolutions – Financial and OtherwiseThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on January 3, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
The holidays are an enjoyable time of thanksgiving and festivities but also an opportunity for personal reflection.  The turning of the calendar provides a natural focal point as we think about ways to improve ourselves and our finances heading into 2017.  In no particular order, here are possible items to […]
 
 



January Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on January 3, 2017 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
Is it anticipation of better economic growth that has investors in a buying mood, or is it fear of being left out of a powerful rally?  Many investors are skeptical of the current stock market rally because stock valuations were already stretched at a time of slow economic growth.  Recent […]
 
 

 

The Risks and Opportunities of a Trump PresidencyThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on December 5, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
The unexpected victory of President-elect Donald Trump necessitated a significant recalibration of expectations for the economy and the financial markets.  Prior to the election, pundits and some economists warned that a Trump presidency could be marked by a recession and steep job losses if his protectionist tendencies led to a […]
 
 



December Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on December 5, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
After 34 years, could the secular bull market in bonds finally be ending?  Interest rates spiked—meaning bond prices fell—in the wake of the Republican Party’s shocking electoral sweep.  The move ran counter to conventional wisdom, which says that investors flee to the safety of sovereign debt in times of uncertainty. […]
 
 

 

Buyer BewareThis entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on November 14, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
Yellow flags abound when making even a cursory review of annuities: Anything that uses two sets of books is immediately suspect. Would you invest in something that calls the return a “roll-up rate” instead of an interest rate? Would you invest in something that has a 12% surrender charge as […]
 
 



November Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on November 14, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
After recovering from the Brexit announcement, the S&P 500 spent much of the third quarter in a tight trading range.  However, recently the market started trending down, likely due to slightly rising interest rates brought about by Central Bank activities. After spending much of the past few years pursuing monetary […]
 
 

 

Politics and InvestingThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on September 30, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
I can’t remember an election cycle that has been so drawn out.  After the mid-term elections in 2014, the media immediately pivoted to the 2016 presidential election and hasn’t let up.  I think the constant attention has worn on people and exacerbated the elevated concern that always comes when two […]
 
 



October Investment CommentsThis entry was posted in  Investment Comments  on September 30, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
After a poor start to 2016, the S&P 500 rallied through the spring, giving itself a good shot at another year of gains.  If the gains do hold, 2016 could be the 13th positive year out of the last 14 for U.S. stocks. June’s Brexit vote caused some ripples, then […]
 
 



Sideshow Alley StocksThis entry was posted in  Viewpoint  on September 14, 2016 by Miles Putnam, CFA  
For this month’s Viewpoint, we wander over to the stock market’s dark and sometimes seedy underbelly for a glimpse at nine companies almost too weird to exist, a Ripley’s Believe It or Not of investment opportunities. Think of the market as a carnival of capitalism.  It has a central midway […]

Personal Money Management
Your money matters. That’s why we take a disciplined approach to portfolio management.
We build wealth for our clients by conducting objective research and providing honest, unbiased advice. That plus personalized attention to you is our mission, our passion, and our life’s work–and that is how we define Personal Money Management.
Our firm has outperformed the S&P 500 Index since 2000 and has been named one of the World’s Best Money Managers by Nelson Investment Management Network. Our Personal Money Management approach sets the gold standard for investment results through research.
We look forward to discussing how our investment management expertise can increase your wealth. Please contact us today!
Equities Research
There are thousands of publicly-traded stocks, but relatively few truly superior businesses. Our growth-oriented and value-disciplined approach to stock selection begins by screening for companies that have a successful track record of growing their sales and earnings and whose stock values leave room for future earnings growth to lead to further stock appreciation.
We expect the companies we buy and hold for our clients to demonstrate good cash flow characteristics. Management should demonstrate its commitment to a singular vision, and that vision should be combined with the company’s commitment to the interests of its shareholders. When a company that meets our growth and value characteristics comes along, we follow it closely, looking for any evidence for or against our thesis that the company has attractive prospects for investors.
A company that demonstrates consistently impressive performance will likely eventually be promoted to “portfolio company,” meaning that we begin purchasing shares for client accounts. Our entire investment team monitors portfolio companies on a day-to-day, week-to-week, and quarter-to-quarter basis for signs of weakness or for superior opportunities.
Sell Discipline
When portfolio companies show signs of trouble, we react quickly to any new information that becomes available and then act according to our reading of the situation. By following companies closely over time, we develop a familiarity with the business and management that hones our ability to interpret new developments.
Sometimes a situation weakens gradually over time, and we are faced with a decision whether to be patient and allow the company and its industry to return to form or move along to the best stock we have to “challenge” the incumbent holding. Tax considerations, as well as general market conditions, can affect the timing of our buy and sell decisions.
Long-term Track Record
The true sign of an expert money manager is not the ability to outperform the market in any one given year. Instead, the real proof is in outperforming the market consistently over a long period of time. Our firm has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 Index since 2000.
Back to top
Fixed Income
Your total returns and your investments’ comprehensive risk profile are the two most important considerations in our approach to Personal Money Management.
We believe other investment managers typically over allocate clients to bonds. In doing so, they introduce substantial inflation risk, as well as the possibility of capital losses if interest rates begin to rise. Despite these risks, however, fixed income can still have a place in an investor’s portfolio.
The municipal bond market can offer some excellent opportunities for tax-sensitive investors. We perform our own research, and we work to find uncommon opportunities trading at prices that allow our clients to earn superior returns compared to what is commonly available through bond funds.
Back to top
Fee Schedule
Our clients do not pay layers of fees for sub-advisors or consultants. We keep all our investment research and portfolio management in-house. Provident clients never pay for “soft-dollar” compensation arrangements. We earn our fee by practicing Personal Money Management for you, and we grow our business by growing your assets.
We have no incentive to “churn” investors’ accounts. Commissions are never inflated.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Zeltiq Aesthetics (NASDAQ:ZLTQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.18)Consensus Price Target: $49.21 (12.86% downside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Zeltiq Aesthetics (NASDAQ:ZLTQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.18)Consensus Price Target: $49.21 (12.86% downside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
    
Starting Quarter:
      
All Available Dates


  Ending Quarter:

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
