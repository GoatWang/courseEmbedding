RBC Global Asset Management adds new global equity team in London



LONDON AND TORONTO, January 14, 2014  - RBC Global Asset Management (RBC GAM) today announced the addition of 10  global equity specialists to its investment management team at RBC Global Asset  Management (UK) Limited (RBC GAM-UK) in London.  The team of specialists, led by Habib Subjally, join from First State  Investments (UK) Limited where they previously managed US$2.5 billion in a  variety of global equity strategies for institutions and private clients over  the past eight years. 
Mr. Subjally will assume the position of senior portfolio manager and head  of Global Equities. Neil Abbott, Luis Benoliel, Marcus Lun, Jeremy Richardson,  Julie Thomas, Dag Wetterwald, Perry Winfield and Ben Yeoh are joining as senior  portfolio managers, and Romain Scampini will join as portfolio manager.
“These expanded capabilities  complement our existing breadth and depth of expertise across a wide range of  global mandates, with a direct benefit to the individual and institutional  investors we serve,” said John Montalbano, chief executive officer, RBC GAM. “The  addition of this team brings considerable new strength to RBC Global Asset  Management’s expertise in global equity management.”
Over the past eight years, Mr. Subjally  was head of Global Equities and led the global equity team at First State  Investments. He holds a Bachelors degree from the London School of Economics and  the Chartered Accountant and ASIP designations. The core of his team has worked  together for the last seven years, with an average tenure of 16 years in the  industry. 
“RBC GAM’s investment approach is  characterized by fundamental research and rigorous discipline, along with a  focus on risk management and portfolio construction, all within a team-oriented  structure,” said Dan Chornous, chief investment officer, RBC Global Asset  Management Inc. “Habib and his team fit seamlessly with our approach, as  demonstrated by their strong investment results and stability of returns, with  notably solid performance in down markets.”
The new global equity team joins  investment professionals at RBC GAM-UK specializing in emerging markets and  European equities, as well as global and emerging markets fixed income. In  total, the London  office currently comprises 34 investment professionals and staff (including  five from the new global equity group). That number will grow to 39 when Mr.  Subjally and the remaining members join in early March.
“As  a global organization with over C$300 billion in assets under management, RBC  GAM is committed to continually growing our capabilities,” said Mr. Montalbano.  “Our growth trajectory – including organic growth as well as successful  acquisitions such as BlueBay Asset Management in 2010 – reflects our commitment  to bringing world-class expertise to our investment solutions and, ultimately,  to our clients.”
