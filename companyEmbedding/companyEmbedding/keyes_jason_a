The JASON Project reserves the right to assume, at its sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with The JASON Project in asserting any available defenses.
XI. Choice of Law; Arbitration of DisputesAny and all disputes, with the exception of copyright claims, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, performance, or breach, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in Washington, D.C., pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered may be entered in the highest court of the forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. This agreement, its validity and effect, shall be interpreted under and governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and you agree that the arbitrators shall award all costs of arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees plus legal rate-of-interest, to the successful party. There will be no consolidation or joinder of any dispute subject to arbitration hereunder with any arbitration or legal proceeding involving third parties or other disputes between the parties hereto. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that the findings of the arbitrator(s) will be conclusive on them, their successors, heirs and assigns and may be entered as a judgment in a court of record. The arbitrator(s) will have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages or any other monetary damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages. This section shall not prohibit any party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of competent the other party.
Copyright claims shall be brought in the Federal court having jurisdiction. If you are an agent for or an employee of a non-U.S. company but operate in a place of business in the U.S. or its territories, you expressly agree that any dispute regarding this contract shall be adjudicated within the U.S in the manner described here. If The JASON Project is obligated to go to court, rather than arbitration, to enforce any of its rights, you agree to reimburse The JASON Project for its respective legal fees, costs, and disbursements if The JASON Project is successful.
XII. MiscellaneousThese Terms and any other operating rules or terms currently posted on the Site constitute the entire agreement between The JASON Project and the users of the Site, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. No action of The JASON Project may be construed as a waiver of any part of these Terms of Use. Should any of the above paragraphs be unenforceable, the other paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Privacy PolicyThe JASON Project recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of users of its Web sites. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices of The JASON Project Web sites, including the JASON Mission Center, our gated Web site for project participants. Below we describe why we gather personally identifiable information, when we collect it, how we use it, with whom we disclose it, and how we protect it. Why do we gather personally identifiable information?You may visit portions of the JASON Web sites without providing any information about yourself. We may collect information that identifies you ("personally identifiable information"), such as name, postal address, e-mail address and phone number, to allow us to process your product orders, inform you of JASON updates and special offers, and provide you with information about our other educational offerings. 
 
When do we gather personally identifiable information?There are three main areas where we collect personally identifiable information. We collect personally identifiable information at The JASON Project Online Store in order to fulfill your order, at the registration site for the JASON Mission Center site, and on The JASON Project survey.  We may also collect personally identifiable information in connection with your submissions for JASON live Webcasts and JASON contests.
The JASON Project Online StoreThe JASON Project Online Store provides forms for ordering The JASON Project educational products, services and other merchandise. These forms require users to provide us with contact information (including name, address, phone number and e-mail address). We also ask for billing information, such as credit card number and expiration date. 
JASON Mission Center Registration and AccountsThe JASON Mission Center is a "gated" Web site maintained by The JASON Project. It provides access to a dynamic online community of school administrators, teachers, students and their parents who collaborate with one another using tools and resources such as message boards and chat rooms that are built into the system.
Teachers, parents and school administrators may create individual JASON Mission Center accounts for themselves. In addition, they may create individual JASON Mission Center accounts for their students, enabling students to access the JASON Mission Center from school or at home. Students may also create their own accounts to access material that relates to subjects learned in the classroom.
All participants in The JASON Project – school administrators, teachers, parents and students – must register online to obtain a username and password that enables access to the site. As part of this registration process, we may collect first and last name, e-mail and postal address, school name, and phone number, if you choose to provide it. If you are a teacher, we also may ask for information about your area of expertise and role at the school. Please note that, as a teacher, you may be subject to policies in your school or district regarding student access to and use of the Internet. Please consult your school or district policies and make sure you have the appropriate parental permission before creating JASON Mission Center accounts for your students.What other information do we gather?Cookies: A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site that stores certain information about your activity on the site.

However, if you disable this function, certain features of the Web site, such as the shopping basket and access to the JASON Mission Center, may not function properly.
Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses: When you visit our Web site, we automatically collect and analyze certain information about your computer. This information includes the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet. We use this IP address to gather broad demographic information, help diagnose problems with our servers, and administer our Web site(s).

We use this information to determine whether your computer can view certain functions of our Web sites (e.g., Java-scripted activities). This browser information is also captured on comment or help forms submitted to assist us in providing technical support.
How do we use the personally identifiable information we collect from you? The JASON Project uses personally identifiable information to process your orders; deliver the products and services you request; help us administer and evaluate The JASON Project educational program; communicate with you about events and online features that we hope you find of interest; notify you about offers and discounts from The JASON Project Online Store; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. 
With whom do we share your personally identifiable information?We may share your personally identifiable information with service providers that perform certain functions on our behalf. These functions include processing credit card orders from The JASON Project Online Store, assisting us in maintaining and managing our customer information, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, and supporting features offered through our Web sites. We do not authorize any of these third parties to make any other use of your information.
We also may share your personally identifiable information with our parent or managing organizations and their affiliates and JASON partners whose products and services we believe you may find of interest.
