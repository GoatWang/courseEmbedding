PITTSBURGH, Oct. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:   PNC) today announced that Joseph C. Guyaux, will retire as senior vice chairman and president and chief executive officer of PNC Mortgage, effective in the spring of 2016. PNC Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer E. William Parsley III will succeed Guyaux as head of PNC Mortgage. Parsley will remain treasurer and CIO.
"During his remarkable 43-year career at PNC, Joe Guyaux has at one time or another led nearly every core business activity within the company," said William S. Demchak, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PNC. "He was the architect of PNC's highly successful Retail Banking business, which has been the foundation for our growth from a small bank in Western Pennsylvania to one of the largest financial institutions in the United States.  He has been a terrific leader and representative of PNC in the community."     
Guyaux joined Pittsburgh National Bank in 1972 as a management development candidate upon his graduation from Brown University. After holding several senior leadership positions, he served as president of PNC from 2002 to 2012, head of Retail Banking from 2005 until 2012, chief risk officer from 2012 to 2015, and early in 2015 accepted his current role with PNC Mortgage.
In 2015, Guyaux was named chairman of the board of directors of Pittsburgh-based health care conglomerate Highmark Health. He is chairman of the board for Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and a life trustee of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In addition, he serves on the boards of directors of DQE Holdings LLC and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. He was elected an emeritus member of the board of directors of Duquesne University in October 2009.
Parsley is responsible for asset and liability management with an emphasis on interest rate risk management and investing PNC's balance sheet. He serves as chairman of PNC Capital Markets, Inc., overseeing the firm's broker dealer activities, and is chairman of PNC Investment Corporation, Inc., managing the firm's alternative investments. In addition, he heads PNC's asset resolution efforts and the Economics group, as well as directs the activities of the company's regional presidents. In addition, he serves on the board of directors at PNC Bank, N.A.
Parsley joined PNC from JP Morgan Chase in 2003 where he was head of its Global Derivative books and co-head of the North American Interest Rate Trading Group. In addition, he held other market-related positions at JP Morgan Chase and has more than 25 years of experience in the financial service industry, with specific expertise in managing interest rate and currency risks. 
Parsley graduated Summa Cum Laude from Boston College School of Management with a degree in finance and computer science.

PNC Elects Joseph C. Guyaux President of the Corporation




PRNewswire-FirstCall
PITTSBURGH


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: PNC) announced today that Joseph C. Guyaux has been elected President of the corporation and of its principal banking subsidiary, PNC Bank, National Association, pending regulatory approval.
(Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020801/PHTH026 )
Guyaux, 52, has been chief executive officer of PNC's Regional Community Bank since 1997, and has recently assumed additional responsibility for PNC's corporate banking, asset-based lending and real estate finance businesses. In his new leadership role, he will also have responsibility for PNC Advisors, the company's wealth management business, as well as the capital markets and leasing businesses.
"I am delighted to recognize Joe with this well-deserved promotion. His diverse experience across key areas of our company makes him the right leader to intensify our focus on providing customers, employees, communities and shareholders the best that PNC has to offer," said James E. Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer. "Joe has directed the transformation of our regional bank into a very strong performer and a model for the financial services industry."
Guyaux was named group executive in 2001 and has held a variety of management roles during his 30-year career with PNC, including the leadership of PNC's wealth management business.
The regional bank is PNC's largest business, serving markets from New Jersey to Kentucky with a wide array of consumer and small business products. It serves 3 million households, and boasts more than 700 branches, the 8th- largest ATM network in the country, and one of the top five call centers in the country. Its consumer lending center has leveraged its expertise and superior technology to process loans for some of the nation's leading financial services companies.
Under Guyaux's direction, the regional bank has acquired and retained valuable customers at record levels, while also achieving an efficiency ratio of 48 percent in the first half of 2002. The regional bank has also achieved high marks in employee and customer satisfaction, key factors in building a strong franchise. In the first half of 2002, this business generated a 27 percent return on assigned capital.
To strengthen customer service, the regional bank has reduced fees, made funds available sooner, expanded its ATM and online capabilities and created easy-to-use products and services. PNC's focus on small business customers has included the creation of business centers in key branches and the expansion of the sales staff.
Guyaux has also spearheaded the company's Promise to Neighborhood Children initiative through which employees have pledged more than 1 million hours of volunteer time in PNC's communities.
"It is my privilege to assume the presidency of PNC," said Guyaux. "During my career at PNC, I have had the honor of working with dedicated and hard working employees who are committed to meeting the needs of our customers and making us a best-in-class business. I look forward to working with the PNC team to accelerate our progress in achieving our vision for the future of the company."
Guyaux joined PNC in 1972 and has served in a number of other key leadership roles, including: senior vice president and manager of PNC's private bank; president of the Northeast PA market; and senior vice president and manager of commercial banking for the Pittsburgh market. Guyaux was elected executive vice president and retail market manager for the Pittsburgh market in 1993. In 1995, he was named head of PNC's wealth management business.
Active in the community, Guyaux serves on the board of directors of Duquesne University and the Consumer Bankers Association, and on the board of trustees of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., headquartered in Pittsburgh, is one of the nation's largest diversified financial services organizations, providing regional community banking, corporate banking, real estate finance, asset-based lending, wealth management, asset management and global fund services.

Share Article


















Highmark Health of Pittsburgh announced today that Joseph C. Guyaux, senior vice chairman of the The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and president and chief executive officer of PNC Mortgage, has been appointed chairman of the board of directors. In addition, Highmark Health president and chief executive officer David L. Holmberg will become chairman of the board of directors of Highmark Inc.







Joseph C. Guyaux



Pittsburgh, PA (PRWEB)
February 26, 2015
 Today, Highmark Health announced that longtime board of director Chairman J. Robert Baum, Ph.D. is stepping down as chairman of the board of directors and will be succeeded by Joseph C. Guyaux, senior vice chairman of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and president and chief executive officer, PNC Mortgage. Additionally, Highmark Health President and Chief Executive Officer David L. Holmberg will become the chairman of the board of directors of Highmark Inc.; both changes are effective as of Wednesday.  
“I am honored to have been elected as the chairman of the board for Highmark Health, the parent organization for a group of companies that are trusted partners to customers, members and patients in the communities we serve,” commented Mr. Guyaux. “This is a particularly dynamic time for our enterprise, as we successfully navigated the marketplace in the wake of health care reform, responded to heightened competition and continued the drive to diversify so that we have a broad base from which to serve customers. I am proud to follow Bob Baum, who has provided inspired leadership at critical junctures and helped position the company for growth and success. We will remember his calm presence, thoughtfulness and genuine interest in the people we serve and in the business he helped guide.”
“I appreciate the board’s confidence in allowing me the opportunity to serve as the chairman of the Highmark Inc. board of directors,” said Mr. Holmberg. “The businesses comprising Highmark Inc. show the depth of our diversity as we seek to transform health care to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, on behalf of all the employees of Highmark Health, I want to express our appreciation to Bob Baum, who dedicated himself to our mission for 35 years.”  
Prior to being named to his current position this month, Guyaux, who has worked at PNC for 42 years, was senior vice chairman and chief risk officer with responsibility for PNC’s enterprise-wide risk management program, including operating, compliance, credit and market risk. 
Guyaux joined PNC in 1972 and, after holding several management positions, was named senior vice president and manager of Metropolitan Commercial Banking in Pittsburgh in 1989. In 1991, he was elected president of PNC’s northeast Pennsylvania market. Guyaux returned to Pittsburgh in 1993 as retail market manager and was named manager, PNC Private Bank in 1995. In 1997, he was appointed deputy manager of Retail Banking and later that year he was named chief executive officer of that business. In that role, Guyaux instituted a successful customer-focused strategy that has resulted in increases in net income, customer and employee satisfaction and extensive employee volunteerism. He became responsible for PNC’s middle market, corporate finance, capital markets, asset-based lending, treasury management, leasing and wealth management businesses in 2001 and 2002. Guyaux was appointed president of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in 2002, a position he held until February 2012, when he was named senior vice chairman and chief risk officer.  
Guyaux previously served as a member of the Highmark Inc. board of directors from 2004–2012 and as a member of several committees. Guyaux is chairman of the board of directors for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and a life trustee of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In addition, he serves as chairman of the board of managers of DQE Holdings LLC.  He was elected an emeritus member of the board of directors of Duquesne University in October 2009.  
Guyaux and his wife are lifelong residents of western Pennsylvania.
Holmberg was appointed Highmark Health’s president and chief executive officer in May 2014, following seven years of service in a series of executive positions within the company.  Most recently, he was president of diversified businesses for Highmark Inc., where he was responsible for businesses representing more than $3.5 billion in revenue.  He has also served as chief executive officer for HVHC Inc. and chief executive officer and chairman for HM Insurance Group, United Concordia Dental and San Antonio, Texas-based Visionworks, formerly Eye Care Centers of America (ECCA). 
Dr. Baum will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of HVHC, Highmark Health’s vision affiliate, which is comprised of Davis Vision and Visionworks. He will also join the board of directors of HM Insurance Group as well as the board of directors of Highmark Health’s dental affiliate, United Concordia, and its subsidiaries.

Focusing on the Customer is No Risk At All

For financial institutions, the line between winning and losing is sharply drawn on risk. The market upheaval on Wall Street was accelerated by firms betting heavily on what turned out to be high-risk assets. PNC Financial Services Group was not one of those banks. Joseph C. Guyaux (MBA '84) had a front row seat to the action. Guyaux, in his former role as president of PNC and head of retail banking, grew the retail core that safely anchored PNC when rough seas swept the market. He visited campus in September as the featured speaker of the 2011 Thought Leaders in Business speaker's forum, when he discussed PNC's strategy for how to excel during tough times: a plan that begins and ends with the customer.
Anthropology and the Future of Banking
Imagine adding a half million new customers but producing less revenue. That is what's happening to the retail business at PNC. Like all banks, historically low interest rates are eating away the bottom line. Deposits are worth less in this environment.
PNC has other challenges too. There is worrisome new competition from companies outside the banking sphere. Slow job growth is holding back the U.S. economy. Financial regulatory reform is a big unknown. So what makes Guyaux relentlessly confident about PNC's future prospects? He believes PNC is well positioned for growth by virtue of the fact that it builds everything around its customers. Under Guyaux's leadership, PNC has rolled out new products targeting the younger demographic, such as Virtual Wallet, an online tool that integrates three accounts — titled spend, reserve, and growth — with industry-leading personal finance tools. The success of this segment led PNC to add features to Virtual Wallet aimed at expanding its appeal to older tech-savvy customers.
"The pathway out is to focus on customers and to think about our guiding principles: reciprocity, transparency, and choice. That's the way out, while we manage our costs, while we manage our capital," Guyaux told a Pitt Business audience of students and alumni gathered in the William Pitt Union for his Thought Leaders presentation.
The Thought Leaders forum, made possible by the support of alumni Shekar Narasimhan (MBA '75) and Ed Hurley (MBA '78), exposes students to leading business thinkers from a variety of industries. The speakers share executive-level insight into how to lead in today's complex global economy.
Often times, innovation is a driving force of effective leadership. Since knowing what customers want isn't easy, PNC leaves nothing to chance. It hired a firm that employs, amongst others, anthropologists and social behaviorists. The firm conducted field research that became the basis for many features of the Virtual Wallet program and its corresponding mobile applications for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android devices.
"The anthropologists and behavioral scientists went and observed how people who are Gen Y live their lives and how they manage their money. What we got from that was our Gen Y customers don't think about checking accounts and savings accounts. What they said was, 'I've got money I spend, I've got money I save, and I've got money in reserve. And how do you fi t into my life to make it easy?' " Guyaux said.
PNC invests in traditional advertising channels, such as television, print media, and billboards, but increasingly the company focuses on social media — and its potential for providing hyper-specific information about customer habits. "Where do you think most of our improvement ideas come from now?" Guyaux asked the audience. "From listening to our customers on Twitter and our blog. The day after we rolled out our check deposit app for the iPhone, I went onto Twitter. Half the Twitter comments were, 'This is great. I can't believe it. This bank gets it.' The other half were, 'What's up with this? No Droid? When are you going to update this? It doesn't do me any good.'"
Cyclical or Secular: The Question Going Forward
Guyaux joined PNC bank in 1972. In March 2012, he was appointed senior vice chairman and chief risk officer. In this role, he oversees PNC's enterprise-wide risk management program, including operating, compliance, credit, and market risk. Prior to that, Guyaux led PNC's consumer businesses, business banking, brokerage, and residential mortgage business.
In the late 1990s, Guyaux experienced a crossroads moment. Popular wisdom was that retail branches were dying. Many banks viewed fee-based services, such as treasury management or investments, as growth engines and were willing to siphon retail's cash to support them.
Guyaux did not agree with that future. He spent the first 12 years of his career in branches; to him their value was clear. So as competitors backed off retail banking, Guyaux went the other way. He pushed PNC to renew its retail focus and implemented strategies that increased revenues, and improved customer and employee satisfaction. Ultimately, its retail core gave PNC a layer of body armor that other banks didn't have during the Wall Street crisis and the extreme downturn.
Even so, Guyaux warns of a tipping point in terms of banks' free services. Fifty years ago, customers only had access to bank branches. Now they have automated teller machines (ATM), call centers, Internet access, and mobile access. PNC customers aren't paying extra for these services. Instead of shuttering branches, PNC is taking advantage of self-service trends, giving customers tools to make their lives easier. "Mobile banking transactions cost us one-tenth of what it costs if customers went into a branch. ATM check imaging is a lower cost also," Guyaux said.
Guyaux says he'd like to see his branches do a better job of demonstrating products for customers. For example, walking out to the ATM and showing them how to deposit a check remotely. "I hate to say this, but most banks — ours included — wait for the customers to discover it by themselves. Apple doesn't do that. You walk in and they start telling you what you might be interested in," Guyaux said.
From Brown to the Pipeline Gang
Raised in Tarentum, a blue-collar town northeast of Pittsburgh, Guyaux was the first in his family to go to college. He earned a scholarship to Brown University. One summer, Guyaux lined up a summer internship in finance. But his father insisted that Guyaux work for the Upper Allegheny Joint Sanitary Authority's pipeline gang, cleaning out riverfront sewers instead. "It was work there or move out," Guyaux recalled. "My father said, 'I don't know what you're doing up there at Brown. But I want to make sure you know what you could be doing if you mess it up.'"
Guyaux laughs about it now, but the labor was hot, dirty, physical work. Not that the banking climate is much more hospitable. "We are going to face increased compliance efforts, and we're going to comply with them," Guyaux said.
Whatever the challenges, Pittsburgh-based PNC marches on. It doubled its size by purchasing National City Bank, and recently finalized the integration of Royal Bank of Canada USA. PNC now employs more than 55,000 people. It operates branches in 19 states, serving more than 6 million customers. "It was astonishing to me that we were able to acquire National City Bank," Guyaux said. "National City Bank was bigger than PNC. So we acquired a bank that was bigger than us, and only had to pay about 30-40 percent of our value to get it. And the reason was, they didn't manage risk, both liquidity risk and credit risk."
PNC emerged from the banking crisis stronger, because it avoided the pitfalls that stuck other banks with a glut of toxic assets. "It did send a message home to us at PNC that said, 'You do get rewarded for managing your risk well. Sometimes it just takes longer.' If there had never been a recession that might never have happened. But if you believe that economies go up and down in varying degrees and varying lengths of prosperity and recession, then you need to be managing your risk," Guyaux said.
