Biography
Dr. McMahon attended the UVA School of Medicine on a Navy scholarship. After internship at Portsmouth Naval Hospital, he attended the Navy’s Undersea Medicine program in Groton, CT and Panama City, FL for submarine and diving medicine. He was then assigned as the Submarine Squadron 14 Medical Officer in Holy Loch, Dunoon, Scotland. After that tour, he completed neurology residency at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. His last tour on active duty was at the Naval Hospital at Camp Pendleton, CA. From there he began his general neurology private practice with his colleagues at Shenandoah Valley Neurology and Augusta Health, where he held many active roles in the outpatient and inpatient clinical services and gained several years of medical staff leadership. His transition to UVA has allowed him to continue his neurology clinic care established at Bath Community Hospital.
Joining UVA’s Neurology Department has afforded Dr. McMahon the opportunity to expand his professional responsibilities in the practice of general neurology, including clinical, teaching and clinical research efforts, as well as to return to serving in the US Navy as a reserve medical corps officer. Dr. McMahon, his wife and son reside in Augusta County and enjoy the many opportunities offered in the Shenandoah Valley.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1959 edition. Volume: no.52:suppl.2 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set.
