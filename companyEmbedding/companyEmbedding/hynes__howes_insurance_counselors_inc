Item 1.  Business                                                               

(a)      Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. (hereafter the "Registrant")  
       was an independent insurance agency handling principally all types of
     casualty, fire and surety insurance.  Registrant was organized as a
      corporation under the laws of the State of Iowa on June 28, 1969, as
        Hynes & Howes Insurance Company.  Because it became apparent this name
         created confusion as to the business of Registrant, an amendment to the
        Articles of the Incorporation was filed on November 17, 1970, with the
   Secretary of the State of Iowa changing the name to Hynes & Howes
Insurance Counselors, Inc.  This action was ratified by the   
stockholders at a meeting February 5, 1971.                   

       At the annual stockholders meetings for 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977,
1978, and 1979, a proposal was made to amend the Articles of  
       Incorporation to change the name of the registrant from Hynes & Howes
Insurance Counselors, Inc., to the United Insurance Counselors
         Corporation.  The Iowa Business Corporation Act requires an affirmative
      vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation to
      effectuate such amendment.  Although a quorum was present at each of
    these annual meetings, fifty per cent (50%) required to change the
        Articles of Incorporation were not represented, and the proposal could
not be acted upon.                                            

(b)      The general insurance agency and brokerage business was highly         
    competitive.  Registrant competed locally and regionally with many
     direct-line writers of fire, casualty and surety insurance who were
       much larger than Registrant in all respects including premium volume,
     capital and personnel employed.  Registrant was also in competition
    with thousands of independent insurance agencies, some of whom had
       higher premium volume and more employees than Registrant.  Registrant
       was not a significant factor in the total volume of general insurance
business.                                                     

      Registrant has sold Davenport agency to Ralph Parry Insurance Agency
Ltd. in January 1981.                                         

         (At the present time, the Registrant does not have any plans to acquire
any insurance agencies.)                                      

        At fiscal year end, Registrant, in its business has no employees.  The
Trustee of the Frank B. Howes Trust which holds 36.5% of the  
    outstanding common stock, Janice Howes died in July 1983, and John
Howes became Trustee of the Frank B. Howes Trust.             

         During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, the Viking Agency and
      the Hansen and Hansen, Inc. general insurance agencies, were sold on
        contract to R.A.P. Enterprises, Inc., Ralph A. Parry, former president
       of Registrant and the former manager of the Davenport agency owned by
Registrant is the owner of R.A.P. Enterprises, Inc.           

 During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, the Davenport
    agencies were sold to Ralph A. Parry Insurance Agency, Ltd., as of
January 1, 1981.  Also owned by Ralph A. Parry.               

         The intention at this time is to continue to loan on and invest in real
estate properties and equities.                               

(c)      Line of Business                                                       

        The Registrant has not engaged in more than one line of business which
      meets the requisites of item 1 (c) (A), (B) or (C) for business with
sales and revenues which do not exceed $50,000.00.            

        Registrant and its subsidiaries are not engaged in material operations
      in foreign countries, nor does Registrant or its subsidiaries have a
         material portion of sales or revenues derived from customers in foreign
countries.                                                    

ITEM 2.                    MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION FOR 9/30/07 
   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity                                                                       

Registrant receives approximately $3,430 of cash each month from
payments of principal and interest on Real Estate Contracts Receivable.         
Registrant has very little liquidity because most of these payments are used to 
pay management fees and other operating expenses.                               

Capital Resources                                                               

The principal assets of the registrant at September 30, 2007 are
nine real estate contracts receivable.                                          

Results of Operations                                                           

The loss from operations for the year ended September 30, 2007  
increased $93,566 compared to the year ended September 30, 2006.                

Total revenue decreased $41,526.  This was primarily due to a   
reduced number of real estate contracts receivable.                             

     Operating expenses increased $52,040.  The increase resulted from the
following:                                                                      

The Company utilizes the employees of a related entity.  For    
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Company paid the related          
entity $22,202 for it's prorata share of wages and payroll tax costs. For the   
year ended September 30, 2006, those payments were $17,623.  The Company also   
increased management fees by $30,000 and prorata telephone and utility charges  
of $6,000.                                                                      

Other operating expenses increased $11,461.                     

Item 3.  Properties
The Registrant has its offices at 2920 Harrison Street, Davenport,
      Iowa.  The Company rents approximately 700 square feet of space with
 furnishings at a monthly rate of $1,350 dollars.  The rent will
increase to $2,000 per month effective October 1, 2007.       

        Registrant feels this office space is of adequate size and capacity to
  handle the business of Registrant and its anticipated growth for
foreseeable future needs.                                     

Item 4.  Parents and Subsidiaries of the Registrant                             

         The Frank B. Howes Trust, which holds 36.5 per cent of the Registrant's
  outstanding common stock, is the parent of the Registrant.  This
     percentage includes 3,000,000 shares which is held in escrow by the
       Insurance Department of Iowa.  The escrow arrangement was required by
     the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa in order to gain
    approval of Registrant's new stock issue of April 1971.  Under the
        terms of this arrangement, those shares could not be sold for a period
   of five (5) years or until Registrant attained certain profitable
operating goals for three (3) consecutive years.  The escrow  
       arrangement also required that should Registrant dissolve during this
         period, the shares held in escrow will not participate in the assets of
     Registrant legally available for distribution until after there has
         been paid or irrevocable set aside for all other shares an amount equal
      to the other shares at the per offering price of $1.25, adjusted for
        stock splits and stock dividends.  As of April 6, 1976, five (5) years
elapsed.                                                      

     The Insurance Department of Iowa, Securities Division has indicated
  that under the terms of the Escrow Agreement the approval of the
    Commissioner of Insurance was required.  The Insurance Department,
  reviewing the condition of the Registrant, did conclude that the
         requisite approval of the Commissioner would not be forthcoming at that
         time, and furthermore, that the Insurance Department will act as escrow
agent for the shares of the Frank B. Howes Trust.             

Item 5.  Legal Proceedings                                                      

None                                                                            

Item 6.  Increases and Decreases in Outstanding Securities and Indebtedness     

(a)  In the fiscal year, Registrant has not issued any new shares or    
     otherwise created additional outstanding securities; neither has it
       reduced outstanding securities by purchase or acquisition of treasury
        shares.  Therefore, there were 11,222,600 shares of Registrant's stock
outstanding on September 30, 2007.                            

(b)  None                                                               

(c)  None                                                               

Item 7.  Changes in Securities and Changes in Security for Registered Securities

None                                                          

Item 8.  Defaults upon Senior Securities                                        

None                                                          

Item 9.  Approximate Number of Equity Security Holders                          

         The approximate number of holders of each class of equity securities of
     Registrant, as of September 30, 2007, is indicated in the following

Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors                                              
Davenport, Iowa                                                                 

We have audited the balance sheet of Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors (an Iowa
corporation) as of September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements
of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.       
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.                                                                  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company   
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we    
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the     
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe            
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                     

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present              
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hynes &             
Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. as of September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005,      
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then         
ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                             

      Nature of operations:  The Company invests in real estate, primarily
   single family residences, which it then resells on contract.  The
    Company operates exclusively in the Quad City metropolitan area of
        Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois.  The Company has a concentration of
     credit risk, in that all of its creditors live and work in the Quad
City area.                                                    

Accounting Policies:  The books and records of the Company are
maintained on the accrual basis of accounting.  Investments in
  contracts receivable are stated at the collectible balance.  The
method of income recognition on installment contracts is the  
  installment method when the downpayment by the purchaser is less
than 5% in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard #66. 
  Earnings per share are computed on the basis of weighted average
     number of common shares outstanding.  Cash and cash equivalents are
    considered to be any investment with an original maturity of three
months or less.                                               

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in 
   conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
       management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
       amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
 and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
        reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.             

      Other significant accounting policies are detailed in other Notes to
Financial Statements.

Note 7 - Stock Held in Escrow                                                   

         At September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 there were 3,546,000 shares of the
       Company's common stock held in trust.  Those shares were owned by the
  Frank B. Howes Trust and by directors or former directors of the
   Company.  The Trust agreement was required by the Commissioner of
 Insurance of the State of Iowa in order to gain approval of the
      Company's stock issue of April, 1971.  Under terms of this agreement
       these shares were to be released after a period of five years or when
    the Company attains certain profitable goals for three consecutive
       years and upon written approval from the Commissioner of Insurance of
 the State of Iowa.  It is also required that should the Company
       dissolve during this period that the pro-rated distribution of assets
to stockholders would be done on a basis which would pay these
shareholders less per share than would be distributable to the
         shareholders of the new issue.  The Company's earnings to date have not
    been sufficient to qualify for the release of these shares held in
      escrow.  The condition requiring that these shares be held in escrow
 for five years has been fulfilled, however, the Commissioner of
         Insurance of the State of Iowa has not granted the written approval for
        the release of these shares at this time.  The shares will continue to
     be held in escrow until the Commisioner grants written approval for
their release.                                                

Note 8 - Contingent Liability for Rescission of Capital Stock Sales             

        Since its inception, the Company has issued and sold 11,222,699 shares
     of its common stock.  Although most of these shares were registered
       with the State of Iowa, none of these shares were registered for sale
         under the federal securities law.  These shares were issued and sold in
         reliance either upon the exemption provided in Section 4 (2) or Section
3 (a) (11) of the Securities Act of 1933.                     

   The Company feels that any possible shares and federal contingent
         liabilities that may have existed because of the issuance of securities
       which may not have been exempt from registration under the Securities
    Act of 1933 and unless the subject of an existing legal proceeding
     filed appropriately, may now be extinguished as a result of the new
       Iowa Uniform Securities Act which became effective on January 1, 1976
     under Section 613 of that Act, liability must now be ascertained by
       looking to the statute in effect at the time that the stock issue was
     sold.  The two year statute of limitations in effect on January 14,
    1973, at the time of the closing of the issue has run, as have the
    other applicable federal statutes of limitation. As a result, with
    the exception of the Federal and State Tolling Doctrines, possible
contingent liabilities may no longer exist.                   

Note 9 - Contingent Liability on Pending Litigation                             

  On November 2, 1973, in U. S. District Court a Final Judgment of
   permanent Injunction was brought against the Company because of a
 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The
       Injunction enjoins the Company from failing to file timely and proper
      reports as required by Section 12 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act
        of 1934.  The Company is currently complying with filing requirements,
     however, it may be subject to subsequent court action and potential
fine if there are future filing deficiencies.                 

Note 10- Provision for Income Taxes                                             

       Due to loss carryforwards from previous years, a provision for income
taxes has not been made.                                      

Net operating loss carryovers will expire as follows:

               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's

Item 1.
Business

(a) Hynes
& Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. (hereafter the "Registrant")
was an independent insurance agency handling principally all types
of casualty, fire and surety insurance. Registrant was organized as
a corporation under the laws of the State of Iowa on June 28, 1969,
as Hynes & Howes Insurance Company. Because it became apparent
this name created confusion as to the business of Registrant, an
amendment to the Articles of the Incorporation was filed on
November 17, 1970, with the Secretary of the State of Iowa changing
the name to Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. This
action was ratified by the stockholders at a meeting February 5,
1971.

At the
annual stockholders meetings for 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977,
1978, and 1979, a proposal was made to amend the Articles of
Incorporation to change the name of the registrant from Hynes &
Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc., to the United Insurance
Counselors Corporation. The Iowa Business Corporation Act requires
an affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of
the corporation to effectuate such amendment. Although a quorum was
present at each of these annual meetings, fifty per cent (50%)
required to change the Articles of Incorporation were not
represented, and the proposal could not be acted upon.

(b) The
general insurance agency and brokerage business was highly
competitive. Registrant competed locally and regionally with many
direct-line writers of fire, casualty and surety insurance who were
much larger than Registrant in all respects including premium
volume, capital and personnel employed. Registrant was also in
competition with thousands of independent insurance agencies, some
of whom had higher premium volume and more employees than
Registrant. Registrant was not a significant factor in the total
volume of general insurance business.

Registrant
has sold Davenport agency to Ralph Parry Insurance Agency Ltd. in
January 1981.

(At the
present time, the Registrant does not have any plans to acquire any
insurance agencies.)

At fiscal
year end, Registrant, in its business has no employees. The Trustee
of the Frank B. Howes Trust which holds 36.5% of the outstanding
common stock, Janice Howes died in July 1983, and John Howes became
Trustee of the Frank B. Howes Trust.

During the
fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, the Viking Agency and the
Hansen and Hansen, Inc. general insurance agencies, were sold on
contract to R.A.P. Enterprises, Inc., Ralph A. Parry, former
president of Registrant and the former manager of the Davenport
agency owned by Registrant is the owner of R.A.P. Enterprises,
Inc.

During the
fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, the Davenport agencies were
sold to Ralph A. Parry Insurance Agency, Ltd., as of January 1,
1981. Also owned by Ralph A. Parry.

The
intention at this time is to continue to loan on and invest in real
estate properties and equities.

(c) Line
of Business

The
Registrant has not engaged in more than one line of business which
meets the requisites of item 1 (c) (A), (B) or (C) for business
with sales and revenues which do not exceed $50,000.00.

Registrant
and its subsidiaries are not engaged in material operations in
foreign countries, nor does Registrant or its subsidiaries have a
material portion of sales or revenues derived from customers in
foreign countries.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION FOR 9/30/09 

MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE STATEMENT OF
OPERATIONS

Liquidity

Registrant
receives approximately $1,303 of cash each month from payments of
principal and interest on Real Estate Contracts Receivable.
Registrant has very little liquidity because most of these payments
are used to pay management fees and other operating
expenses.

Capital
Resources

The
principal assets of the registrant at September 30, 2009 are three
real estate contracts receivable. 

Results of
Operations

The loss
from operations for the year ended September 30, 2009 increased
$33,645 compared to the year ended September 30, 2008.

Total
revenue decreased $53,603. This was primarily due to a reduced
number of real estate contracts receivable.

Operating
expenses decreased $19,958. The decrease resulted from the
following:

The
Company utilizes the employees of a related entity. For the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2009, the Company paid the related entity
$14,938 for it's prorata share of wages and payroll tax costs. For
the year ended September 30, 2008, those payments were $22,389. The
Company repairs and maintenance decreased by $14,612 and other
expenses decreased by $5,637. The Company increased accounting fees
by $7,742.00.

Item 3.
Properties

The
Registrant has its offices at 2920 Harrison Street, Davenport,
Iowa. The Company rents approximately 700 square feet of space with
furnishings at a monthly rate of $2,000 per month.

Registrant
feels this office space is of adequate size and capacity to handle
the business of Registrant and its anticipated growth for
foreseeable future needs.

Item 4.
Parents and Subsidiaries of the Registrant

The Frank
B. Howes Trust, which holds 36.5 per cent of the Registrant's
outstanding common stock, is the parent of the Registrant. This
percentage includes 3,000,000 shares which is held in escrow by the
Insurance Department of Iowa. The escrow arrangement was required
by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa in order to
gain approval of Registrant's new stock issue of April 1971. Under
the terms of this arrangement, those shares could not be sold for a
period of five (5) years or until Registrant attained certain
profitable operating goals for three (3) consecutive years. The
escrow arrangement also required that should Registrant dissolve
during this period, the shares held in escrow will not participate
in the assets of Registrant legally available for distribution
until after there has been paid or irrevocable set aside for all
other shares an amount equal to the other shares at the per
offering price of $1.25, adjusted for stock splits and stock
dividends. As of April 6, 1976, five (5) years elapsed.

The
Insurance Department of Iowa, Securities Division has indicated
that under the terms of the Escrow Agreement the approval of the
Commissioner of Insurance was required. The Insurance Department,
reviewing the condition of the Registrant, did conclude that the
requisite approval of the Commissioner would not be forthcoming at
that time, and furthermore, that the Insurance Department will act
as escrow agent for the shares of the Frank B. Howes Trust.


Item 5.
Legal Proceedings

None

Item 6.
Increases and Decreases in Outstanding Securities and
Indebtedness

(a) In the
fiscal year, Registrant has not issued any new shares or otherwise
created additional outstanding securities; neither has it reduced

shares. Therefore, there were 11,222,699 shares of Registrant's
stock outstanding on September 30, 2009.

Item
9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have
evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of
the period covered by this Annual Report Form on 10-K. These
disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon our evaluation as of September 30, 2009, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2009, to ensure that information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.

MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) as well as criteria established in
Item 308T of Regulation S-K.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and
dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
Board of Directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Due to its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be
effective, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate as a result
of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of
compliance.

Based on
the assessment, our management has concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30,
2009 and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The results of management's assessment were
reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our
independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management's report was not
subject to attestation by our independent registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management's
report in this annual report.

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

During the
fourth quarter ended September 30, 2009, there were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
