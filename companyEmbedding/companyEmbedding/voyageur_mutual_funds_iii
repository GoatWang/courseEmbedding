What Is a Mutual Fund?
Since the creation of the first modern-day mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust, in 1924, there has been a steady growth of mutual funds. Today there are around 8,000 mutual funds.1 Because of their convenience and flexibility, you might want to consider including mutual funds in your investment portfolio.
A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other securities that is purchased and professionally managed by an investment company with the capital from a group of investors. When you invest in a mutual fund, the investment company pools your money with that of other investors that is invested to pursue the objectives stated in the mutual fund prospectus.
As a mutual fund shareholder, you gain an equity position in the fund and, therefore, in all of the underlying securities. You share in any gains and/or losses of the fund. The mutual fund manager trades securities, incurring capital gains or losses, and generates dividend or interest income. Some mutual funds hold securities that offer the potential for capital appreciation. When these securities are sold by the fund, it distributes the profits from the sale to its shareholders in the form of capital gains. Most mutual funds will automatically reinvest your dividends and capital gains in additional shares, if you’d like.
You can redeem your mutual fund shares at any time for their current market value. The value of mutual fund shares is determined daily, based on the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares purchased. The return and principal value of mutual fund shares fluctuate with market conditions; shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Purchasing shares in a mutual fund can give you access to a diversified portfolio, often without having to spend a large chunk of money and time deciding which types of individual securities to purchase on your own. In addition, you benefit from having your investment managed by a financial professional. Diversification is a method to help manage investment risk, but it does not guarantee a profit or protect against investment loss.
Mutual funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information about the investment company, can be obtained from your financial professional. Be sure to read the prospectus carefully before deciding whether to invest.

NOTES 
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              
The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by Voyageur Mutual Funds III
- Delaware Select Growth Fund (the "Fund").                                     

SECURITY VALUATION - Equity securities, except those traded on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, Inc. (NASDAQ), are valued at the last quoted sales price as of the time 
of the regular close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the valuation     
date. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ  
Official Closing Price, which may not be the last sales price. If on a          
particular day an equity security does not trade, then the mean between the bid 
and asked prices will be used. Short-term debt securities having less than 60   
days to maturity are valued at amortized cost,

(UNAUDITED)                                                                     

which approximates market value. Other securities and assets for which market   
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in  
good faith under the direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees.                 

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES - The Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal      
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite    
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income     
taxes has been made in the financial statements.                                

CLASS ACCOUNTING - Investment income, common expenses and realized and          
unrealized gain (loss) on investments are allocated to the various classes of   
the Fund on the basis of daily net assets of each class. Distribution expenses  
relating to a specific class are charged directly to that class.                

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with   
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make       
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and        
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ  
from those estimates.                                                           

OTHER - Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of  
Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of average net assets.       
Management fees and other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions are  
recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date). Costs   
used in calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment         
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Dividend income is        
recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual 
basis. The Fund expects to declare and distribute all of its net investment     
income, if any, to shareholders as dividends annually and will distribute net   
capital gains, if any, annually.                                                

In addition, in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements of the Tax   
Reform Act of 1986, the Fund may declare special year-end dividend and capital  
gains distributions during November or December to shareholders of record on a  
date in such month. Such distributions, if received by shareholders by January  
31, are deemed to have been paid by the Fund and received by shareholders on the
earlier of the date paid or December 31 of the prior year.                      

2. INVESTMENTS                                                                  
At July 31, 2004, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes has   
been estimated since the final tax characteristics cannot be determined until   
fiscal year end. At July 31, 2004, the aggregate cost of investments and gross  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the Portfolio for federal income tax 
purposes was as follows:                                                        

                                                                [Download Table]

Net unrealized appreciation        $ 51,011,212 
                                   ------------ 

At April 30, 2004, for federal income tax purposes, the Fund had capital loss   
carryforwards of $909,537,916, which may be carried forward and applied against 
future capital gains. Such capital loss carryforwards expire as follows:        
$22,409,888 expires in 2008, $166,380,616 expires in 2009, $504,089,842 expires 
in 2010, $198,127,159 expires in 2011 and $18,530,411 expires in 2012.

3. SECURITIES LENDING                                                           
The Fund, along with other funds in the Delaware Investments Family of Funds,   
may lend its securities pursuant to a security lending agreement (Lending       
Agreement) with Mellon Bank N.A. ("Mellon"). Initial security loans made        
pursuant to the Lending Agreement are required to be secured by U.S. Treasury   
obligations and/or cash collateral not less than 102% of the market value of the
securities issued in the United States. With respect to each loan, if the       
aggregate market value of the collateral held on any business day is less than  
the aggregate market value of the securities which are the subject of such loan,
the borrower will be notified to provide additional collateral not less than the
applicable collateral requirements. Cash collateral received is invested in the 
Mellon GSL DBT II Collateral Fund (Collateral Fund), a collective investment    
vehicle to be utilized by Mellon for the purpose of investment and reinvestment 
of cash collateral on behalf of its clients in its securities lending program.  
The Collateral Fund invests in high quality, short-term investments with a      
weighted average maturity not to exceed 90 days. However, in the event of       
default or bankruptcy by the lending agent, realization and/or retention of the 
collateral may be subject to legal proceedings. In the event the borrower fails 
to return loaned securities and the collateral received is insufficient to cover
the value of the loaned securities and provided such collateral shortfall is not
the result of investment losses, the lending agent has agreed to pay the amount 
of the shortfall to the Fund, or at the discretion of the lending agent, replace
the loaned securities. The Fund continues to record dividends on the securities 
loaned and is subject to changes in fair value of the securities loaned that may
occur during the term of the loan. The Fund has the right under the Lending     
Agreement to recover the securities from the borrower on demand. The security   
lending agent and the borrower retain a portion of the earnings from the        
collateral investments. The Fund records security lending income net of such    
allocation.                                                                     

At July 31, 2004, the market value of the securities on loan was $48,617,190,   
for which cash collateral was received and invested in accordance with the      
Lending Agreement. Such investments are presented on the Statement of Net Assets
under the caption "Securities Lending Collateral."
4. CREDIT AND MARKET RISK                                                       
The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in small- and medium- sized
companies and may be subject to certain risks associated with ownership of      
securities of small- and medium- sized companies. Investments in small- and     
medium- sized companies may be more volatile than investments in larger         
companies for a number of reasons, which include more limited financial         
resources or a dependence on narrow product lines.

ITEM 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have evaluated the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures within 90    
days of the filing of this report and have concluded that they are effective in 
providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by 
the registrant in its reports or statements filed under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time     
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange         
Commission.                                                                     

 There were no significant changes in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter   
(the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that 
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the    
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.                         

ITEM 3. EXHIBITS. 

File as exhibits as part of this Form a separate certification for each   
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the registrant as

forth below:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-Q of Voyageur Mutual Funds III;      

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
    statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this  
report;                                                               

3.   Based on my knowledge, the schedules of investments included in this report
   fairly present in all material respects the investments of the registrant
as of the end of the fiscal quarter for which the report is filed;    

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for     
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
 in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
 control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:          

(a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such 
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our 
    supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
         registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
         us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared;                        

 (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
       such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
  our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
       reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

accounting principles;                                      

  (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
         and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
         effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
         within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report, based on such
evaluation; and                                             

(d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal 
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
  most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
     reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and                       

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the   
    registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):           

    (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
    operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
     reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
     record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

    (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
      employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.

 CERTIFICATION

I, Joseph H. Hastings, certify that:                                            

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-Q of Voyageur Mutual Funds III;      

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
    statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this  
report;                                                               

3.   Based on my knowledge, the schedules of investments included in this report
   fairly present in all material respects the investments of the registrant
as of the end of the fiscal quarter for which the report is filed;    

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for     
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
 in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
 control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:          

(a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such 
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our 
    supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
         registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
         us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared;                        

 (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
       such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
  our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
       reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles;                                      

  (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
         and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
         effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
         within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report, based on such
evaluation; and                                             

(d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal 
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
  most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
     reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and                       

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the   
    registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):           

    (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
    operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
     reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
     record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

    (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
      employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.

A Commitment To Our Investors                                                   

Delaware Investments has a tradition of money management that dates             
back to 1929. We have a long and distinguished history of helping               
individuals and institutions - including some of America's largest              
pension funds - reach their financial goals.                                    

Headquartered in Philadelphia, a block from the nation's oldest       
stock exchange, the Delaware organization established its first mutual          
fund in 1938. Delaware International Advisers Ltd., our international           
affiliate, was established in 1990 and is headquartered in London.              

Delaware Investments offers a full range of mutual funds. We also     
manage investments for variable annuity products, unit investment               
trusts and closed-end funds, and offer retirement plan services for             
individuals and businesses.                                                     

Delaware manages more than $45 billion in mutual fund assets and      
institutional advisory accounts for more than half-a-million                    
investors. We're part of a global financial service and investment              
management business owned by Lincoln Financial Group, whose                     
subsidiaries manage more than $120 billion in assets.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                         MAY 8, 1998 

FISCAL 1998 WAS A SPECTACULAR PERIOD for the U.S. stock market. We are          
pleased to report that Aggressive Growth Fund and Growth Stock Fund             
provided exceptional results for their first year under the                     
stewardship of Delaware Investments.                                            

AGGRESSIVE GROWTH FUND                                                          

Aggressive Growth Fund achieved a total return of +98.60% for the 12            
months ended April 30, 1998 (for A Class shares at net asset value              
with distributions reinvested). This was more than double the +41.06%           
total return of the unmanaged Standard & Poor's 500 Index for the               
period.                                                                         

Nearly doubling one's money in a single year is a brilliant - and     
rare - accomplishment. Aggressive Growth Fund was in the right place            
at the right time. The Fund had strong weightings in technology,                
retailing and consumer service stocks that performed well in fiscal             
1998 and higher-than-average cash positions prior to periods of market          
weakness.                                                                       

Market appreciation and new investments nearly tripled the size       
of Aggressive Growth Fund during the second fiscal half. The Fund's             
positive cash flow helped the portfolio manager, Gerald S. Frey,                
quickly move in and out of stocks of all sizes to maximize capital              
appreciation potential. This strategy, while providing high returns in          
fiscal 1998, also generated a high portfolio turnover rate of 356%.             

The Fund's sterling results for fiscal 1998 represented a             
combination of favorable market forces and prudent stock picking, in            
our view.  Since its inception, the Fund's returns have consistently            
been in the top 5% of an increasingly competitive class - growth-               
oriented mutual funds. According to Lipper Analytical Services, the             
Fund's results ranked #1 of 860 growth funds, 6th out of 536 growth             
funds and 19th out of 423 growth funds, respectively, for the 12-               
month, 36-month and lifetime periods ended April 30, 1998 (ranking              
based on total return at net asset value).

Delaware Investments recognizes that some growth-oriented investors             
are concerned about short-term market volatility. We offer Growth               
Stock Fund as a more tempered method of growth-style investing. The             
Fund provided a respectable return of +35.27% for the 12 months ended           
April 30, 1998.

Growth Stock Fund has a strict focus on stocks with the highest       
Standard & Poor's quality ratings. During fiscal 1998 stocks of large           
domestic-oriented companies fared well while shares of some                     
multinational companies lagged the S&P 500 Index. In general,                   
investors feared that some global giants would face reduced earnings            
from Asia.                                                                      

THE FUND'S STERLING RESULTS DURING FISCAL 1998 REPRESENT A COMBINATION          
OF MARKET FORCES AND PRUDENT STOCK PICKING, IN OUR VIEW.                        

Given the unprecedented stock appreciation since the mid-1990s,       
we doubt the year ahead will be quite as dynamic as fiscal 1998, but            
it could prove rewarding nonetheless. Many economic factors in the              
U.S. remain positive, especially for growth stocks. Inflation appears           
caged at less than 2% per year. Business spending on technology to              
improve productivity remains substantial. Economic weakness in Asia             
appears to be having less of an effect on U.S. growth than investors            
feared last autumn.                                                             

For nearly seven decades, Delaware Investments has built a solid      
reputation among institutional and individual investors by taking a             
disciplined, value-oriented approach to equity investing. With the              
addition of more options for growth-oriented investors, we believe we           
are making our mark as a fund family that offers a full line of                 
choices to help people meet their long-term goals.

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REVIEWS                                                     
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH FUND                                                          
In managing Aggressive Growth Fund, we believe it is imperative to pay          
constant and careful attention to risk, to foresee danger ahead and             
adapt quickly to changing market conditions.                                    

Although inflation and interest rates fell to near record lows in     
fiscal 1998, Aggressive Growth Fund's management team faced a                   
challenging stock selection environment. Some industries, notably               
health care, were battered by operating and/or regulatory problems.             
Stock market volatility increased amid recession along the Pacific              
Rim. Among some domestic-oriented companies, particularly technology            
firms, earnings growth stagnated.                                               

Still, we achieved remarkable success. Your Fund's results            
outpaced both the unmanaged S&P 500 Index and all of our growth fund            
peers. We chose stocks that helped us outperform many industry groups,          
as shown below.                                                                 

While we acquired a solid portfolio from the Voyageur fund family     
in April 1997, Aggressive Growth Fund's best performing stocks this             
past year were our own selections. Only two of the 50 stocks in the             
Fund's portfolio a year ago were still in the portfolio as of April
30, 1998 - WELLS FARGO AND ASCEND COMMUNICATIONS.                               

In our view, the Fund's relatively high 356% portfolio turnover       
rate this past year was a byproduct of ebullient market conditions. We          
believe it prudent to realize capital gains to reduce risk rather than          
allow the Fund's portfolio to become overheated with overvalued                 
stocks.

Our positioning in COMPUSA in fiscal 1998 illustrated this            
philosophy. We purchased shares of the computer retailer in late                
spring of 1997. The stock did well and we liquidated our position in            
late autumn as it became clear that the company's fundamental                   
prospects were not as strong as we expected.

Aggressive Growth Fund invests in small, medium or large              
companies whose earnings growth rate appears to be accelerating or              
consistently high. Typically, we look for companies whose profits can           
grow at least 20% per year. We favor industries likely to benefit from          
changes in consumer or business buying habits.                                  

When appropriate, we also try to capitalize on situations that        
temporarily depress a growth stock's price. We look for fundamentally           
sound, growth companies whose prices have been affected by short-term           
earnings disappointments, management turnover or regulatory problems.           

WE BELIEVE IT PRUDENT TO REALIZE CAPITAL GAINS TO REDUCE RISK RATHER            
THAN ALLOW THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO TO BECOME OVERHEATED WITH OVERVALUED            
STOCKS.                                                                         

Many stocks with high capital appreciation potential have a high      
risk profile. Your Fund's relatively high beta, or historical price             
volatility as shown on page 6, reflects an aggressive strategy                  
suitable for investors who understand the risks involved.                       

INCREASED DIVERSIFICATION                                                       
At the start of fiscal 1998, more than 50% of the Fund's holdings were          
in technology-related industries. We diversified the portfolio by               
adding retail, entertainment and health care companies and reduced our          
technology exposure to approximately 24% of net assets by year's end.           

Among our top performing holdings were large companies such as:       

(bullet) LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES, AT&T's spin off of the former Bell Labs;          
(bullet) mid-size companies such as KEANE INC., an applications                 
software company that manages computer help desks; and,       
(bullet) small companies such as AMAZON.COM INC., a direct mail book            
seller.                                                       

Health care was our problem child. We underperformed other S&P        
500 stocks in this industry group because we held positions in two              
physician practice management firms negatively affected by a failed             
merger - MEDPARTNERS AND PHYCOR. We jettisoned our position in                  
Medpartners, but have kept Phycor, which we believe has superior                
earnings potential.

It is unrealistic to expect the Fund to duplicate its fiscal 1998     
triumph in the year ahead. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about your           
Fund's prospects, especially relative to mutual funds with a narrow             
focus.                                                                          

Aggressive Growth Fund's approach gives us the flexibility to         
invest in any size company that we believe possesses superior capital           
appreciation potential. In our view, it is better to hold stocks in             
many companies of different sizes than attempt to predict when one              
asset class will outperform another.

Overall, we believe the single most important factor that will        
affect your Fund's results in fiscal 1999 will be the fact that we are          
a disciplined team working toward a common goal. As part of our                 
fundamental spadework with executives in face-to-face meetings, we              
ask:                                                                            

(bullet) What controls are there over a business?                               
(bullet) How confident is management in a company's earnings                    
prospects?                                                    
(bullet) How candid is management when discussing competitors,                  
pricing, sales and growth?                                    

Today's fast paced equity market requires the agility of a pit        
crew. Our team of four experienced analysts and I carefully examine             
potential stock selections to see what makes a company run. We believe          
expert knowledge of a particular industry and competitive environment           
can help us distinguish between companies likely to do well in 1999             
and those likely to run out of gas.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY                                                             
Growth Stock Fund maintains a concentrated portfolio of no more than            
30 stocks with a near equal weighting in each security. This number             
gives us a diverse yet highly manageable portfolio that we believe has          
greater potential to perform well over time.                                    

We select stocks based on four criteria:                              
(bullet) High Standard & Poor's quality ratings;                                
(bullet) Strong earnings growth potential;                                      
(bullet) Above-average dividend growth potential; and,                          
(bullet) Low stock prices relative to earnings.                                 

strategy                                                                        

Your Fund invests only in companies with Standard and Poor's          
quality ratings of A+ or A. Stock quality ratings are based on 10-year          
earnings, with companies rated A+ and A having the most historical              
consistency in expanding their profits. While a high rating doesn't             
imply a stock is a good buy at a particular moment, we believe S&P              
ratings are a valuable starting point that helps us determine which             
stocks merit further research.                                                  

From a universe of approximately 200 to 250 A and A+ rated            
companies, we look for businesses with strong earnings growth                   
potential based on a consensus of analysts' estimates. Along with               
dividend growth potential, we believe earnings prospects indicate               
capital appreciation potential.                                                 

Finally, we focus on companies whose stock prices relative to         
earnings (P/E ratios) are in the bottom 20% of their historical range.          
We consider this an indication that a stock is undervalued.                     

Your Fund's average holding period for a stock has historically       
been about four years. This long-term approach is reflected in the              
Fund's modest portfolio turnover rate, which has historically been              
lower than the average of similar funds that also focus on large                
company stocks with a blend of growth and value characteristics,                
according to Morningstar.                                                       

Historically, Growth Stock Fund has outperformed the unmanaged        
S&P 500 Index during periods of increased market volatility and                 
underperformed during periods of rapid price appreciation. We believe           
this has occurred because the earnings performance of companies with            
high S&P quality ratings tends to be less dependent on overall                  
economic growth than other companies in the S&P 500.                            

When the economy or stock market is performing well, investors        
tend to increase their risk profile by seeking companies likely to              
have robust earnings growth. High quality and consistency tend to               
become less important than a rapid rise in profits. However, once               
uncertainties such as higher interest rates or international problems           
enter the picture - as happened this past spring and last autumn -              
investors tend to covet earnings consistency. We therefore believe              
the current stock market environment - with its concerns about                  
Federal Reserve Board tightening and the impact of the Pacific                  
Rim recession - bodes well for your Fund.

STRATEGIC POSITIONING AND OUTLOOK                                               
By our estimate, some 93% of stocks that met our S&P quality criteria           
were selling within the upper 20% of their historical price range               
relative to earnings as of                                                      

outlook                                                                         

April 30, 1998. While this has made stock selection a challenge, we believe     
that it does not necessarily mean a major market decline is at hand.            

During fiscal 1998, both U.S. inflation and long-term interest        
rates fell to historical lows. This helped support stock prices.                
Consumer prices rose just 1.4% during fiscal 1998, the smallest rise            
since the 1960s. Equally important is that many government economic             
indicators suggested no sign of inflation on the horizon.                       

AS OF YEAR'S END, THE AVERAGE P/E RATIO OF STOCKS IN THE FUND'S                 
PORTFOLIO WAS 22 TIMES TRAILING EARNINGS, ABOUT A 20% DISCOUNT TO THE           
OVERALL STOCK MARKET.                                                           

Still, we believe it was prudent to consider the stock market's       
downside risks. We upgraded the average quality rating of stocks in             
the Fund's portfolio in the past year. As of year's end, about two-             
thirds of the stocks in the Fund's portfolio had quality ratings of             
A+, the highest available. The average P/E ratio of stocks in the               
Fund's portfolio was 22 times trailing earnings, about a 20% discount           
to the overall stock market.

Generally, we sell companies when their P/E reaches a historical      
peak and replace them with companies within the same sector that are            
trading at historically low P/Es. During the early autumn, for                  
example, we sold SUNTRUST BANKS, a Georgia regional bank, to purchase           
NORWEST CORP., a Minnesota regional bank. In the spring, we sold                
PITNEY BOWES, the office equipment company, and boosted our position            
in computer and printer maker HEWLETT-PACKARD.                                  

In fiscal 1998, our strategy sometimes negatively affected our        
short-term results because some of the stock market's best performers           
were companies with high valuations. However, we are confident that             
over the long run our growth and value approach will put us in a good           
position should we encounter challenging market conditions in the year          
ahead.

What is a Standard & Poor's quality rating and how is it different              
from a debt rating?

S&P quality ratings show how consistently a company's earnings have             
grown. Debt ratings are based on a company's ability to pay its                 
obligations based on leverage and economic conditions.

1.     FUND REORGANIZATION                                                      
On April 30, 1997, Lincoln National Corporation ("LNC") acquired                
Voyageur Fund Managers Inc.'s ("Voyageur") parent, Dougherty Financial          
Group, Inc. ("DFG"), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated          
January 15, 1997, in which LNC acquired DFG including the mutual fund           
investment advisory business of DFG conducted by Voyageur. Upon                 
completion of the acquisition, Delaware Management Company, Inc.                
("DMC") became the investment advisor to the Funds, Delaware                    
Distributors, L.P. ("DDLP") became the distributor for the Funds, and           
Delaware Service Company, Inc. ("DSC") became the transfer, dividend-           
disbursing, shareholder servicing and accounting service agent for the          
Funds.                                                                          

2.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                          
The following accounting policies are in accordance with generally              
accepted accounting principles and are consistently followed by the             
Funds.                                                                          

SECURITY VALUATION - Securities listed on an exchange are valued at             
the last quoted sales price as of the close of the NYSE on the                  
valuation date. Securities not traded or securities not listed on an            
exchange are valued at the mean of the last quoted bid and asked                
prices. Money market instruments having less than 60 days to maturity           
are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value. Other             
securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily               
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or            
under the direction of the Fund's Board of Directors.                           

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES - Each Fund intends to continue to qualify as a            
regulated investment company and make the requisite distributions to            
shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has            
been made in the financial statements. Income and capital gain                  
distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax              
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting                 
principles.                                                                     

CLASS ACCOUNTING - Investment income, common expenses and realized and          
unrealized gain (loss) on investments are allocated to the various              
classes of the Funds on the basis of daily net assets of each class.            
Distribution expenses relating to a specific class are charged                  
directly to that class.                                                         

OTHER - Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments            
Family of Mutual Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of          
average net assets. Security transactions are recorded on the date the          
securities are purchased or sold (trade date). Costs used in                    
calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment                 
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Dividend income           
is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on          
the accrual basis. Original issue discounts are accreted to interest            
income over the lives of the respective securities. Each Fund declares          
and pays dividends from net investment income and capital gains                 
annually.                                                                       

Certain Fund expenses are paid through "soft dollar" arrangements with          
brokers. The amount of these expenses is less than 0.01% of the Fund's          
average daily net assets.                                                       

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in                   
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires               
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported           
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial                  
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during             
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those                    
estimates.                                                                      

3.     INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES             
Commencing May 1, 1997, and in accordance with the terms of the                 
Investment Management Agreement, the Funds pay DMC, the Investment              
Manager of the Funds, an annual fee of 1.00% of average net assets,             
which is calculated daily on the net assets of each Fund.                       

DMC has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with Voyageur Asset               
Management Inc. with respect to the management of the Growth Stock              
Fund. The sub-advisor receives a sub-advisory fee from DMC for their            
services. The Growth Stock Fund does not pay any fees to the sub-               
advisor.                                                                        

DMC has elected to waive that portion of the management fee and                 
reimburse each Fund to the extent that annual operating expenses,               
exclusive of taxes, interest, brokerage commissions and extraordinary           
expenses, exceed 1.75% of each Fund's average daily net assets                  
attributable to Class A shares, 1.50% of each Fund's average daily net          
assets attributable to Institutional Class shares, and 2.50% of each

shares. Total expenses absorbed by DMC for the year ended April 30,
1998 are as follows:

The Fund may invest up to 15 % of its total assets in illiquid                  
securities which may include securities with contractual restrictions           
on resale, securities exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the           
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other securities which may not          
be readily marketable. The relative illiquidity of some of these                
securities may adversely affect the Fund's ability to dispose of such           
securities in a timely manner and at a fair price when it is necessary          
to liquidate such securities.

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of                    
Aggressive Growth Fund and Growth Stock Fund (the "Funds") as of April
30, 1998, and the related statements of operations, statements of               
changes in net assets and financial highlights for the year then                
ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the              
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to               
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial                  
highlights based on our audits. The statements of changes in net                
assets for the year ended April 30, 1997 and the financial highlights           
for the periods presented through April 30, 1997 were audited by other          
auditors whose report thereon dated June 13, 1997 expressed an                  
unqualified opinion on those statements and financial highlights.               

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit           
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements           
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit            
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts            
and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights.           
Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of April
30, 1998, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. An audit            
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall                 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the 1998 financial statements and financial highlights          
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of             
each of the respective Funds at April 30, 1998, and the results of              
their operations, the changes in their net assets, and their financial          
highlights for the year then ended, in conformity with generally                
accepted accounting principles.
