Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.
He returned to F.C. Nordsjælland in November 2005 as backup for first team choice Kim Christensen, playing for FCN's reserve side in the Denmark Series.[4]
August 2007, having yet to make his league debut, with 2 first team appearances in cup competitions, Hansen renewed his contract for another 4 years. Where he claimed he turned down first team opportunities from 1st Division clubs, to instead be patient and wait for his chance with FCN, whom he credited for his football education.[5]
First choice goalkeeper and captain Kim Christensen was sold to IFK Göteborg on March 13, 2008. Theis F. Rasmussen was then brought in on a free, leaving speculation on who would be first choice to replace the departed Christensen. It was expected that Rasmussen was to be ahead of Hansen in selection, as was a common occurrence in the national youth team, though Jesper Hansen would go on to be first choice and Theis Rasmussen would fail to make a single league appearance during his two-season stay with F.C. Nordsjælland.[6]
17 March 2008, head coach Morten Wieghorst gave Hansen his league debut, after almost 5 years as backup, he started the game in goal against F.C. Midtjylland, which they would lose 1-0.[7] His first clean sheet would come a week later in a 1-0 win over Brøndby.[8] Hansen would go on to concede 26 goals in his first 15 appearances in the last half of the 2007-08 season, since his debut, giving FCN one of the worst defense records in the league, the team would finish 9th in the league.
With F.C. Nordsjælland ending the first half of the 2008-09 season close to relegation, the club opted to bring in experienced Serbian goalkeeper Nenad Novaković on a free transfer, taking over as first choice, Hansen being demoted back to the bench for the rest of the season.[9] The gamble paid off, as the club avoided relegation once again, finishing a slightly improved 8th in the league. At the start of the 2009-10 season, Hansen broke his thumb, ending any chance of him retaking the first choice position as goalkeeper for the duration of the injury. The situation resulted in the club bringing in Thomas Villadsen as backup for Novaković, on a temporary deal.[10]
Mid season, after some poor performances from Novaković, Hansen was given a chance to retake the goalkeeping position, with a start against AGF, he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win and consequently returned as first choice for FCN. He claimed after the match that being benched was a learning experience.[11]
Hansen would go on to make some instrumental performances for the rest of the season, including a strong performance against league champions F.C. Copenhagen, keeping a clean sheet in a shock 2-0 win,[12] as well as being credited for keeping the Farum club alive in their 3-1 Danish cup quarter final win against Silkeborg.[13] Hansen would go on to be part of the Danish cup winning squad, his first senior trophy, in a 2-0 win over F.C. Midtjylland in the final.
Hansen retained his position as first choice the following 2010-11 season, with head coach Morten Wieghorst often praising his performances in the media. Hansen as well as the team slowly improved throughout the season, gaining on their previous league finish with 6th and once again went to the finals of the Danish cup, lifting the trophy for a second consecutive time, in a 3-2 win over FCM. With Hansen's contract expiring at the end of the season, there was speculation whether or not he would remain at the club. Jesper Hansen had hinted at trying something new, but nothing materialized.[14] He would eventually sign a new contract, keeping him at the club for another year, till summer 2012.[15]
Starting the 2011-12 season for FCN in impressive form, with good performances against Sporting Lisbon and HB Køge and helping the team peak to 2nd in the Danish Superliga, Hansen is linked with a possible move abroad, with foreign clubs taking note of his recent form. Hansen's agent stating that he may leave the club on a transfer during the winter of 2011, or on a free when his contract expires in the summer of 2012.[16] On 24 September 2011, in a match with AGF, Hansen was involved in a collision with striker Søren Larsen, which resulted in Hansen going off in the 44th minute and was rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with a concussion and spent the next few days in hospital to be monitored.[17] Hansen would return to action on 15 October, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over AaB. At the start of the winter break, Jesper Hansen signed a new 2-year contract extension with F.C. Nordsjælland.[18]
SC Bastia[edit]
On August 8, 2015, SC Bastia announced the signing of Hansen.[19]
Lyngby Boldklub[edit]
On 22 June 2016, Hansen returns to his native Denmark and signed a three-year contract for Denmark club Lyngby Boldklub.[20][21]
International career[edit]
January 2006, during a mini-tournament in Chile, Hansen saved a penalty in a penalty shootout for the Danish under-21s to book a place in the finals against Unión Española. Which they would go on to win 1-0 with a goal from Morten Rasmussen.[22] Hansen was selected for the Danish squad for UEFA U-21 Championship 2006 in Portugal.[23] He was 3rd choice behind Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard and Theis F. Rasmussen.
3 November 2011, Hansen received his first call up to the senior national team to face Sweden in a friendly.[24] Hansen was once again called up in December 2011, for Denmark's tour of Thailand in January.[25]

Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.

Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.
He returned to F.C. Nordsjælland in November 2005 as backup for first team choice Kim Christensen, playing for FCN's reserve side in the Denmark Series.[4]
August 2007, having yet to make his league debut, with 2 first team appearances in cup competitions, Hansen renewed his contract for another 4 years. Where he claimed he turned down first team opportunities from 1st Division clubs, to instead be patient and wait for his chance with FCN, whom he credited for his football education.[5]
First choice goalkeeper and captain Kim Christensen was sold to IFK Göteborg on March 13, 2008. Theis F. Rasmussen was then brought in on a free, leaving speculation on who would be first choice to replace the departed Christensen. It was expected that Rasmussen was to be ahead of Hansen in selection, as was a common occurrence in the national youth team, though Jesper Hansen would go on to be first choice and Theis Rasmussen would fail to make a single league appearance during his two-season stay with F.C. Nordsjælland.[6]
17 March 2008, head coach Morten Wieghorst gave Hansen his league debut, after almost 5 years as backup, he started the game in goal against F.C. Midtjylland, which they would lose 1-0.[7] His first clean sheet would come a week later in a 1-0 win over Brøndby.[8] Hansen would go on to concede 26 goals in his first 15 appearances in the last half of the 2007-08 season, since his debut, giving FCN one of the worst defense records in the league, the team would finish 9th in the league.
With F.C. Nordsjælland ending the first half of the 2008-09 season close to relegation, the club opted to bring in experienced Serbian goalkeeper Nenad Novaković on a free transfer, taking over as first choice, Hansen being demoted back to the bench for the rest of the season.[9] The gamble paid off, as the club avoided relegation once again, finishing a slightly improved 8th in the league. At the start of the 2009-10 season, Hansen broke his thumb, ending any chance of him retaking the first choice position as goalkeeper for the duration of the injury. The situation resulted in the club bringing in Thomas Villadsen as backup for Novaković, on a temporary deal.[10]
Mid season, after some poor performances from Novaković, Hansen was given a chance to retake the goalkeeping position, with a start against AGF, he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win and consequently returned as first choice for FCN. He claimed after the match that being benched was a learning experience.[11]
Hansen would go on to make some instrumental performances for the rest of the season, including a strong performance against league champions F.C. Copenhagen, keeping a clean sheet in a shock 2-0 win,[12] as well as being credited for keeping the Farum club alive in their 3-1 Danish cup quarter final win against Silkeborg.[13] Hansen would go on to be part of the Danish cup winning squad, his first senior trophy, in a 2-0 win over F.C. Midtjylland in the final.
Hansen retained his position as first choice the following 2010-11 season, with head coach Morten Wieghorst often praising his performances in the media. Hansen as well as the team slowly improved throughout the season, gaining on their previous league finish with 6th and once again went to the finals of the Danish cup, lifting the trophy for a second consecutive time, in a 3-2 win over FCM. With Hansen's contract expiring at the end of the season, there was speculation whether or not he would remain at the club. Jesper Hansen had hinted at trying something new, but nothing materialized.[14] He would eventually sign a new contract, keeping him at the club for another year, till summer 2012.[15]
Starting the 2011-12 season for FCN in impressive form, with good performances against Sporting Lisbon and HB Køge and helping the team peak to 2nd in the Danish Superliga, Hansen is linked with a possible move abroad, with foreign clubs taking note of his recent form. Hansen's agent stating that he may leave the club on a transfer during the winter of 2011, or on a free when his contract expires in the summer of 2012.[16] On 24 September 2011, in a match with AGF, Hansen was involved in a collision with striker Søren Larsen, which resulted in Hansen going off in the 44th minute and was rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with a concussion and spent the next few days in hospital to be monitored.[17] Hansen would return to action on 15 October, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over AaB. At the start of the winter break, Jesper Hansen signed a new 2-year contract extension with F.C. Nordsjælland.[18]
SC Bastia[edit]
On August 8, 2015, SC Bastia announced the signing of Hansen.[19]
Lyngby Boldklub[edit]
On 22 June 2016, Hansen returns to his native Denmark and signed a three-year contract for Denmark club Lyngby Boldklub.[20][21]
International career[edit]
January 2006, during a mini-tournament in Chile, Hansen saved a penalty in a penalty shootout for the Danish under-21s to book a place in the finals against Unión Española. Which they would go on to win 1-0 with a goal from Morten Rasmussen.[22] Hansen was selected for the Danish squad for UEFA U-21 Championship 2006 in Portugal.[23] He was 3rd choice behind Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard and Theis F. Rasmussen.
3 November 2011, Hansen received his first call up to the senior national team to face Sweden in a friendly.[24] Hansen was once again called up in December 2011, for Denmark's tour of Thailand in January.[25]
Honours[edit]
Club[edit]

Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.
He returned to F.C. Nordsjælland in November 2005 as backup for first team choice Kim Christensen, playing for FCN's reserve side in the Denmark Series.[4]
August 2007, having yet to make his league debut, with 2 first team appearances in cup competitions, Hansen renewed his contract for another 4 years. Where he claimed he turned down first team opportunities from 1st Division clubs, to instead be patient and wait for his chance with FCN, whom he credited for his football education.[5]

With F.C. Nordsjælland ending the first half of the 2008-09 season close to relegation, the club opted to bring in experienced Serbian goalkeeper Nenad Novaković on a free transfer, taking over as first choice, Hansen being demoted back to the bench for the rest of the season.[9] The gamble paid off, as the club avoided relegation once again, finishing a slightly improved 8th in the league. At the start of the 2009-10 season, Hansen broke his thumb, ending any chance of him retaking the first choice position as goalkeeper for the duration of the injury. The situation resulted in the club bringing in Thomas Villadsen as backup for Novaković, on a temporary deal.[10]
Mid season, after some poor performances from Novaković, Hansen was given a chance to retake the goalkeeping position, with a start against AGF, he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win and consequently returned as first choice for FCN. He claimed after the match that being benched was a learning experience.[11]
Hansen would go on to make some instrumental performances for the rest of the season, including a strong performance against league champions F.C. Copenhagen, keeping a clean sheet in a shock 2-0 win,[12] as well as being credited for keeping the Farum club alive in their 3-1 Danish cup quarter final win against Silkeborg.[13] Hansen would go on to be part of the Danish cup winning squad, his first senior trophy, in a 2-0 win over F.C. Midtjylland in the final.
Hansen retained his position as first choice the following 2010-11 season, with head coach Morten Wieghorst often praising his performances in the media. Hansen as well as the team slowly improved throughout the season, gaining on their previous league finish with 6th and once again went to the finals of the Danish cup, lifting the trophy for a second consecutive time, in a 3-2 win over FCM. With Hansen's contract expiring at the end of the season, there was speculation whether or not he would remain at the club. Jesper Hansen had hinted at trying something new, but nothing materialized.[14] He would eventually sign a new contract, keeping him at the club for another year, till summer 2012.[15]
Starting the 2011-12 season for FCN in impressive form, with good performances against Sporting Lisbon and HB Køge and helping the team peak to 2nd in the Danish Superliga, Hansen is linked with a possible move abroad, with foreign clubs taking note of his recent form. Hansen's agent stating that he may leave the club on a transfer during the winter of 2011, or on a free when his contract expires in the summer of 2012.[16] On 24 September 2011, in a match with AGF, Hansen was involved in a collision with striker Søren Larsen, which resulted in Hansen going off in the 44th minute and was rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with a concussion and spent the next few days in hospital to be monitored.[17] Hansen would return to action on 15 October, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over AaB. At the start of the winter break, Jesper Hansen signed a new 2-year contract extension with F.C. Nordsjælland.[18]

On August 8, 2015, SC Bastia announced the signing of Hansen.[19]

Which they would go on to win 1-0 with a goal from Morten Rasmussen.[22] Hansen was selected for the Danish squad for UEFA U-21 Championship 2006 in Portugal.[23] He was 3rd choice behind Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard and Theis F. Rasmussen.
3 November 2011, Hansen received his first call up to the senior national team to face Sweden in a friendly.[24] Hansen was once again called up in December 2011, for Denmark's tour of Thailand in January.[25]

Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.
He returned to F.C. Nordsjælland in November 2005 as backup for first team choice Kim Christensen, playing for FCN's reserve side in the Denmark Series.[4]
August 2007, having yet to make his league debut, with 2 first team appearances in cup competitions, Hansen renewed his contract for another 4 years. Where he claimed he turned down first team opportunities from 1st Division clubs, to instead be patient and wait for his chance with FCN, whom he credited for his football education.[5]
First choice goalkeeper and captain Kim Christensen was sold to IFK Göteborg on March 13, 2008. Theis F. Rasmussen was then brought in on a free, leaving speculation on who would be first choice to replace the departed Christensen. It was expected that Rasmussen was to be ahead of Hansen in selection, as was a common occurrence in the national youth team, though Jesper Hansen would go on to be first choice and Theis Rasmussen would fail to make a single league appearance during his two-season stay with F.C. Nordsjælland.[6]
17 March 2008, head coach Morten Wieghorst gave Hansen his league debut, after almost 5 years as backup, he started the game in goal against F.C. Midtjylland, which they would lose 1-0.[7] His first clean sheet would come a week later in a 1-0 win over Brøndby.[8] Hansen would go on to concede 26 goals in his first 15 appearances in the last half of the 2007-08 season, since his debut, giving FCN one of the worst defense records in the league, the team would finish 9th in the league.
With F.C. Nordsjælland ending the first half of the 2008-09 season close to relegation, the club opted to bring in experienced Serbian goalkeeper Nenad Novaković on a free transfer, taking over as first choice, Hansen being demoted back to the bench for the rest of the season.[9] The gamble paid off, as the club avoided relegation once again, finishing a slightly improved 8th in the league.

The situation resulted in the club bringing in Thomas Villadsen as backup for Novaković, on a temporary deal.[10]
Mid season, after some poor performances from Novaković, Hansen was given a chance to retake the goalkeeping position, with a start against AGF, he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win and consequently returned as first choice for FCN. He claimed after the match that being benched was a learning experience.[11]

At the start of the winter break, Jesper Hansen signed a new 2-year contract extension with F.C. Nordsjælland.[18]
SC Bastia[edit]
On August 8, 2015, SC Bastia announced the signing of Hansen.[19]
Lyngby Boldklub[edit]

Early life[edit]
Hansen played for Ølstykke FC during his youth career, before moving onto Farum BK in 2000.
Senior career[edit]
F.C. Nordsjælland[edit]
Promoted to then, Farum BK first team in January 2003, Hansen signed his first contract extension in May 2003 after showing potential to be a promising goalkeeper.[1]
Having yet to make his debut for the first team, Hansen went on loan to Ølstykke FC in December 2004, the team he previously played for at youth level.[2] Hansen would extend his stay at Ølstykke for an additional 6 months, where he was first choice goalkeeper for the team, whom were struggling to avoid regulation in the Danish 1st Division.[3] He would go on to make 37 league appearances during his year-long stay at Ølstykke.
He returned to F.C. Nordsjælland in November 2005 as backup for first team choice Kim Christensen, playing for FCN's reserve side in the Denmark Series.[4]
August 2007, having yet to make his league debut, with 2 first team appearances in cup competitions, Hansen renewed his contract for another 4 years. Where he claimed he turned down first team opportunities from 1st Division clubs, to instead be patient and wait for his chance with FCN, whom he credited for his football education.[5]
First choice goalkeeper and captain Kim Christensen was sold to IFK Göteborg on March 13, 2008. Theis F. Rasmussen was then brought in on a free, leaving speculation on who would be first choice to replace the departed Christensen. It was expected that Rasmussen was to be ahead of Hansen in selection, as was a common occurrence in the national youth team, though Jesper Hansen would go on to be first choice and Theis Rasmussen would fail to make a single league appearance during his two-season stay with F.C. Nordsjælland.[6]
17 March 2008, head coach Morten Wieghorst gave Hansen his league debut, after almost 5 years as backup, he started the game in goal against F.C. Midtjylland, which they would lose 1-0.[7] His first clean sheet would come a week later in a 1-0 win over Brøndby.[8] Hansen would go on to concede 26 goals in his first 15 appearances in the last half of the 2007-08 season, since his debut, giving FCN one of the worst defense records in the league, the team would finish 9th in the league.
With F.C. Nordsjælland ending the first half of the 2008-09 season close to relegation, the club opted to bring in experienced Serbian goalkeeper Nenad Novaković on a free transfer, taking over as first choice, Hansen being demoted back to the bench for the rest of the season.[9] The gamble paid off, as the club avoided relegation once again, finishing a slightly improved 8th in the league. At the start of the 2009-10 season, Hansen broke his thumb, ending any chance of him retaking the first choice position as goalkeeper for the duration of the injury. The situation resulted in the club bringing in Thomas Villadsen as backup for Novaković, on a temporary deal.[10]
Mid season, after some poor performances from Novaković, Hansen was given a chance to retake the goalkeeping position, with a start against AGF, he managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win and consequently returned as first choice for FCN. He claimed after the match that being benched was a learning experience.[11]
Hansen would go on to make some instrumental performances for the rest of the season, including a strong performance against league champions F.C. Copenhagen, keeping a clean sheet in a shock 2-0 win,[12] as well as being credited for keeping the Farum club alive in their 3-1 Danish cup quarter final win against Silkeborg.[13] Hansen would go on to be part of the Danish cup winning squad, his first senior trophy, in a 2-0 win over F.C. Midtjylland in the final.
Hansen retained his position as first choice the following 2010-11 season, with head coach Morten Wieghorst often praising his performances in the media. Hansen as well as the team slowly improved throughout the season, gaining on their previous league finish with 6th and once again went to the finals of the Danish cup, lifting the trophy for a second consecutive time, in a 3-2 win over FCM. With Hansen's contract expiring at the end of the season, there was speculation whether or not he would remain at the club. Jesper Hansen had hinted at trying something new, but nothing materialized.[14] He would eventually sign a new contract, keeping him at the club for another year, till summer 2012.[15]
Starting the 2011-12 season for FCN in impressive form, with good performances against Sporting Lisbon and HB Køge and helping the team peak to 2nd in the Danish Superliga, Hansen is linked with a possible move abroad, with foreign clubs taking note of his recent form. Hansen's agent stating that he may leave the club on a transfer during the winter of 2011, or on a free when his contract expires in the summer of 2012.[16] On 24 September 2011, in a match with AGF, Hansen was involved in a collision with striker Søren Larsen, which resulted in Hansen going off in the 44th minute and was rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with a concussion and spent the next few days in hospital to be monitored.[17] Hansen would return to action on 15 October, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over AaB. At the start of the winter break, Jesper Hansen signed a new 2-year contract extension with F.C. Nordsjælland.[18]
SC Bastia[edit]
On August 8, 2015, SC Bastia announced the signing of Hansen.[19]
Lyngby Boldklub[edit]
On 22 June 2016, Hansen returns to his native Denmark and signed a three-year contract for Denmark club Lyngby Boldklub.[20][21]
International career[edit]
January 2006, during a mini-tournament in Chile, Hansen saved a penalty in a penalty shootout for the Danish under-21s to book a place in the finals against Unión Española. Which they would go on to win 1-0 with a goal from Morten Rasmussen.[22] Hansen was selected for the Danish squad for UEFA U-21 Championship 2006 in Portugal.[23] He was 3rd choice behind Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard and Theis F. Rasmussen.
3 November 2011, Hansen received his first call up to the senior national team to face Sweden in a friendly.[24] Hansen was once again called up in December 2011, for Denmark's tour of Thailand in January.[25]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
