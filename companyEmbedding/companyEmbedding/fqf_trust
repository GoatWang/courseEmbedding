OUSA Fund Description
The O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend ETF tracks an index that selects and weights large- and midcap U.S. stocks based on three 3 factors: high quality, low volatility, and high dividend yield.
  
OUSA FactSet Analytics Insight
OUSA brings a factor-based, high dividend yield approach to the large- and midcap US equity markets. Constituents in the underlying index are selected from the FTSE USA Index—600 of the largest publicly-listed companies within the US—and weighted by three 3 factors: high quality, low volatility, and high dividend yield. The fund attempts to capture higher yield while attempts to capture higher yield while mitigating holding risks. OUSA places a 5% cap on any one constituent at each quarterly rebalance on each security to avoid under-diversification. The resulting portfolio can make big sector bets. OUSA doesn't trade in huge volumes, but spreads are low enough for retail investors. Excellent block liquidity makes it easy to enter and exit for larger investors. OUSA charges a middle-of-the-road fee, but holding costs are hard to assess for such a young fund and investors should pay close attention to their realized holding costs.



OUSA MSCI ESG Fund metrics Insight
The MSCI ESG Fund Quality Score measures the ability of ETF underlying holdings to manage key medium to long-term risks and opportunities arising from environmental, social, and governance factors, as determined by MSCI ESG Research LLC.

OUSA ranks in the 86th percentile within its peer group and in the 52nd percentile within the global universe of all funds in MSCI ESG Fund Metrics coverage.
