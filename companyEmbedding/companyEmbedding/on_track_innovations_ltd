Marks the first installment of larger 10,000 system orderOTI’s industry-leading EMV and FeliCa contactless readers leverage latest innovations in FeliCa payment industryJapan’s nearly 6 million vending machines represent major opportunity for OTIROSH PINNA, Israel, July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  On Track Innovations Ltd. (OTI) (NASDAQ:OTIV), a global provider of near field communication (NFC) and cashless payment solutions, announced today the successful delivery of 3,000 payment systems to a well-known Japanese retailer. The systems include the Company’s new UNO Plus EMV and FeliCa contactless reader and the GoBox Multi-Service Telemetry Gateway. This first 3,000 system delivery was completed according to schedule and is part of a previously announced letter of intent and purchase order for 10,000 systems.
“This is a meaningful milestone for OTI,” said Shlomi Cohen, OTI’s CEO. “We have set our first foothold in Japan’s estimated 6 million vending machine market. This milestone also indicates that we are executing on our strategy to grow OTI’s business in the substantial Asia-Pacific market. Our EMV and FeliCa-based thin-client payment solutions were designed specifically for the Japanese market, creating flexibility, with local customers paying using FeliCa based cards and international customers paying using their EMV credit cards, such as Visa and MasterCard.” OTI’s UNO Plus is the first contactless reader produced outside Japan to achieve dual EMV and FeliCa certification. OTI’s GoBox is a powerful Machine-to-Machine (M2M) controller, payment gateway and multi-services enabler for unattended machines. It provides new revenue streams for machine operators, from accepting cashless payments through streaming paid Full-HD video via the GoBox’s HDMI output. About OTI On Track Innovations (OTI) is a global leader in the design, manufacture and sale of secure cashless payment solutions using contactless NFC technology with an extensive patent and IP portfolio. OTI’s field-proven innovations have been deployed around the world to address cashless payment and management requirements for the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, unattended retail and petroleum markets. OTI distributes and supports its solutions through a global network of regional offices and alliances. For more information, visit www.otiglobal.com.

Contactless Payment Transaction Market: Demand for Speedy Counter Sales Processes Boosts Adoption




Contactless Payment Transaction Market (Mode of Payment - Contactless Card (NFC/RFID), Wearable Devices, and Contactless Mobile Payment; End Use - Hospitality, Transport, Media and Entertainment, Retail, and Healthcare) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2017 - 2025This press release was orginally distributed by SBWireAlbany, NY -- (SBWIRE) -- 07/12/2017 --  The presence of several small and large service providers renders a highly competitive vendor landscape, notes one of the recent reports by Transparency Market Research (TMR). Competition in the market has further intensified with the entry of banks, card companies, telecom companies, and payment companies of late. The ease of entry in the market is expected to witness inflow of new participants to add to the fragmentation and competition in terms of service costs.Some of the prominent names in the global contactless payment transaction market are Apple Inc., Barclays, Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, Gemalto N.V., Ingenico Group, On Track Innovations Ltd., Verifone Systems Inc., Heartland Payment Systems, Inside Secure, Samsung Elecrronics Ltd., and Wirecard AG.As per a report by Transparency Market Research, the global contactless payment transaction market is likely to expand at a jaw-dropping 55.5% CAGR for the forecast period between 2017 and 2025 for the market to be worth US$801.44 bn by 2025.Rising Popularity of Wireless Devices for Communication Pushes Europe to Lead PositionIn terms of mode of payment, the segment of contactless cards accounted for the dominant share in the market in 2016 revenue-wise and volume-wise. The segment is expected to stay in the lead in terms of rate of adoption displaying a massive 94.3% CAGR vis-a-vis revenue in the global contactless payment transaction market over the report's forecast period.From a geographical standpoint, Europe is expected to be at the forefront in terms of growth in the global contactless payment transaction market. In 2016, Europe held a massive 59.4% share of the overall market. The region is expected to register strong growth over the report's forecast period chiefly driven by the rising use of NFC-enabled smart wearable devices and increased adoption of contactless cards.Get More Information: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=2566Rising Use of Mobile Phones Majorly Fuelling GrowthAt the forefront of driving growth in the global contactless payment transaction market is the rising demand for fast and convenient means for completing transactions, predominantly in the retail and transport sectors underpinned by the rising use of smartphones for payments. Businesses are increasingly recognizing the direct benefits of contactless payment transaction options in the form of speedy counter sales processes and a considerable increase in the number of transactions during a business day. This is leading to the swift uptake of contactless payment systems across industry sectors such as hospitality, healthcare, and media and entertainment for its tangible benefits.The increasing uptake of smartphones or basic mobile phones is having a profound impact on the adoption of contactless payment systems.
