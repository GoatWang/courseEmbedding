			Henderson, NV, 
			February 29, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	Empire Stock Transfer Inc., a full-service transfer agent and registrar registered with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission providing corporate services worldwide, is pleased to introduce its new charitable donation program, PAYING DIVIDENDS.
“Supporting worthwhile local and global organizations reflects our desire to give back and be a socially responsible business,” said Matthew Blevins, vice president. “The organizations we chose are making a big impact and have demonstrated fiscal responsibility funding their programs.” The program begins on March 1.
For each stock transfer completed, the issuing company will get one entry. Each month, three clients will be selected and a donation will be made in the companies’ names to one of three non-profit organizations – they choose which organization they want to support.

EDI 867 Product Transfer and Resale Report

Common T-Sets > X12 EDI T-Sets / EDIFACT EDI T-Sets

Search T-Sets






The EDI 867 transaction set represents a Product Transfer and Resale Report. It is used to provide information on a product that has been transferred to a new location within a company, or to report sales of a product from multiple locations to an end customer (i.e., point-of-sale, or POS, data). It may also be used to communicate returns from customers to distribution center or retail locations.

Each 867 document includes the following information:

Organization identification information
Product transfer and resale detail, including quantity, purchase order, type codes and contract identifiers
Transaction totals in terms of line items, their weights and other units of measure

The 867 transaction set is used in a variety of industries. It is perhaps most commonly used by retailers to communicate to their vendors on the sales of their products at individual store locations. But it can be used by manufacturers and virtually every type of reseller, including wholesalers, distributors, retailers and the like. For example, wholesalers may use the 867 to communicate to a manufacturer about the movements of their product to other wholesale locations, or to other downstream channel partners, and to detail returns from these locations to the wholesaler.

The 867 is also used by utilities to communicate meter information – that is, information on usage of electricity, natural gas, etc. In addition, the 867 may be used by these utilities to transmit allowance transfer information to the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The 867 is similar to the 852 transaction set, which is used by resellers to provide information on product inventory and sales levels to the manufacturers of those products.

If you are a manufacturer who needs to meet your resellers’ requirements for EDI, 1EDISource can help. We can get you in compliance quickly, with EDI WebSource™, our premium web-based EDI portal. You get full EDI capabilities, in a simple-to-use and affordable solution. Contact 1EDISource today for a one-on-one demo with a trained EDI WebSource™ consultant.
