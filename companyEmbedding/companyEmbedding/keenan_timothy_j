Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Iowa:













Does Timothy J Keenan carry a valid contracting license?



Although a contractor license is not required in the state of Iowa, contractors earning more than $2000 per year from construction related work must register their business with the Iowa Division of Labor.
Timothy J Keenan currently holds license 2941 (Master Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Iowa?



In Iowa, general contractors are not required to pass an exam to become licensed. However, plumbing and electrical contractors do have to pass a trade exam to obtain a license in Iowa.











Your liability risk when hiring Timothy J Keenan



Registered contractors in Iowa are required to carry an active workers' compensation policy. In addition to workers' compensation insurance, it is always a good idea to hire contractors with general liability insurance. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liabilty insurance 











Financial recourse when hiring Timothy J Keenan



Iowa contractors are required to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file a claim against this bond in the event of faulty work or damaged property. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Iowa, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
