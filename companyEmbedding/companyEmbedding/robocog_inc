Terms of Service
Last modified: September 15, 2014
Welcome to HiringSolved!
Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are
provided by Robocog Inc. (dba “HiringSolved”), located at 260 S. Arizona Ave,
Chandler Arizona, United States.
By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them
carefully. HiringSolved offers multiple Services. Additional terms will be
available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of
your agreement with us if you use those Services.
Using our Services
You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. Don’t
misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to
access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions
provided by us. You may use our Services only as permitted by law. We may
suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our
terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. Using our
Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our
Services or the content you access. These terms do not grant you the right to
use any branding or logos used in our Services.
Our Services display some content that is not HiringSolved’s. This content is
the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. In connection
with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements,
administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of
those communications.
Your HiringSolved Account
You may need a HiringSolved Account in order to use our Services. You may
create your own HiringSolved Account, or your HiringSolved Account may be
assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or team lead. If you
are using a HiringSolved Account assigned to you by an administrator, different
or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or
disable your account. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or
account, email secint@hiringsolved.com
immediately.
Privacy and Copyright Protection
HiringSolved’s privacy policies explain how we
treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By
using our Services, you agree that HiringSolved can use such data in accordance
with our privacy policies.
Your Content in our Services
Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any
intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what
belongs to you stays yours. When you upload or otherwise submit content to our
Services, you give HiringSolved a license to host and distribute such content 
on your behalf. The rights you grant in this license are to allow us to operate
the functions (such as replicating or "backing up" your data to ensure
availability) required to ensure that our Services work for you. You are
granting us rights to your data so that we can make it available for your use 
in our services. We will not share your data with anyone without your explicit
permission. You can find more information about how HiringSolved uses and
stores content in the privacy policies. If you
submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or
suggestions without obligation to you.
Automation Rules & Rates
Your HiringSolved account may include unlimited access to HiringSolved (Talent
Feed) Candidates. If you have an unlimited account there are no daily, weekly,
or  monthly limits on the number of candidates you can view. However, we do
monitor usage to detect automated requests. Automated requests (also known  as
crawling, scraping, or scripting) may be automatically rate limited by  our
servers to preserve Quality of Service for our other users. We have several
options for customers who wish to access our data in bulk.  If you are
interested in a custom solution or bulk data access, or If you  would like to
integrate your application with HiringSolved or access HiringSolved via our 
API please email api@hiringsolved.com or call
us at (415) 625-9111.
About Software in our Services
When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may
update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available.
Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings. HiringSolved
gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive
license to use the software provided to you by HiringSolved as part of the
Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy
the benefit of the Services as provided by HiringSolved, in the manner 
permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease
any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or
attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those
restrictions or you have our written permission. Open source software is
important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an 
open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions
in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.
Payment, Billing and Cancellation of our Services
If you have a monthly subscription and are paying by credit card, you give
HiringSolved permission to bill your credit card for the subscription price,
each month until you cancel your subscription. If you are an enterprise 
customer or have negotiated specific terms via a Statement of Work or SOW, the
payment terms in your Statement of Work will take precedence over these terms.
If you have a monthly subscription and are paying by credit card, you can 
cancel your account by accessing your account settings and clicking on the
option to cancel. To access your settings, login to HiringSolved and click on
your name in the upper right corner of the interface. You are solely 
responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to
cancel your account is not considered a cancellation, unless and until 
confirmed by a representative of HiringSolved. This is best done through the 
in-app management tools under the settings of your account.
If you are an enterprise customer or have negotiated specific terms via a
Statement of Work or SOW, the terms in your Statement of Work will take
precedence over these terms. Please call us at (415) 625-9111 or email
support@hiringsolved.com.
If you have a monthly subscription and are paying by credit card and you cancel
the service before the end of your current billing cycle, your cancellation 
will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.
Modifying and Terminating our Services
We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove
functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
You can stop using our Services at any time, though we’ll be sad to see you go.
HiringSolved may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new
limits to our Services at any time. We believe that you own your data and
preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service,
where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a
chance to get information out of that Service.
Our Warranties and Disclaimers
We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care
and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that 
we don’t promise about our Services. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE
TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER HiringSolved NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR
DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE
DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC
FUNCTION OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO 
MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE 
FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
Liability for our Services
WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, HIRINGSOLVED AND HIRINGSOLVED’S SUPPLIERS AND
DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA,
FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF HiringSolved,
AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING
FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE
SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN). IN ALL CASES,
HiringSolved, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
Business uses of our Services
If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts
these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify HiringSolved and its
affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action
arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms,
including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits,
judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.
About these Terms
We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to,
for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms
on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no
sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing 
new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you 
should discontinue your use of that Service. If there is a conflict between
these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for 
that conflict. These terms control the relationship between HiringSolved and
you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, 
this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as
taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not
enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The laws of California,
U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any
disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims
arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated
exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California,
USA, and you and HiringSolved consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

contact page.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

    Company Pays $40K Settlement for Allegedly Scraping LinkedIn Corp.’s User Data 



Aug 13, 2014





 




Privacy Law Corner


Robocog, Inc., doing business as HiringSolved, allegedly scraped content from LinkedIn Corp.’s member data and displayed this information in their software product used for talent searches and data aggregation. On July 16, 2014, a proposed settlement was granted in the U.S. Northern District of California requiring Robocog, Inc. to pay $40,000 to LinkedIn as well as to destroy all of the LinkedIn member data which was scraped from its website within 30 days after the settlement is approved. LinkedIn filed a lawsuit against HiringSolved under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, California’s Comprehensive Computer Access and Fraud Act and brought breach of contract and trespass claims. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits persons from knowingly and intentionally accessing computer systems without authorization, something that social media companies like LinkedIn have attempted to use against those that “scrape” data from their websites. 
Tip: This case reminds companies looking to use “screen scraping” technology to pull information from other websites should move forward with care. Depending on the nature of the information collected and how that information is pulled and used, these activities could result in complaint from the sites being scraped.
