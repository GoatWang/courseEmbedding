Endowment History

The Moody Endowment (originally named The Transitional Learning Center, Inc.) was formed by philanthropist Robert L. Moody, Sr. on April 29, 1985 as a Texas non-profit organization under the Internal Revenue Code.
		




					From its inception, the purpose of The Moody Endowment has been to provide support to organizations committed to the rehabilitation of individuals suffering from head injuries and related charitable, educational and scientific activities.
				




What We Do

        The exclusive purpose of The Moody Endowment is to serve as a supporting organization to a class of organizations (including Transitional Learning Center at Galveston) whose purpose is to conduct rehabilitation programs (including transitional living programs and independent living programs), to provide social services and conduct sociological studies, to perform research to promote the recovery of individuals who have suffered head injuries and the return of such individuals to active lives, to provide treatment to persons suffering from neurological disorders and to conduct research related thereto, to conduct informational programs and to carry on other charitable, scientific, literary or educational activities within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.

Today, The Moody Endowment provides support to Transitional Learning Center at Galveston, a national pioneer in post-acute care for patients with acquired brain injury, which operates three separate facilities in Texas.  In addition to funding such care and rehabilitation, The Moody Endowment has also funded numerous research projects designed to better understand brain injuries and their affects.  Such research projects have dramatically improved not only the treatment of brain injuries and cognitive rehabilitation, but also the way that rehabilitation is delivered.
