IDG-Accel raises $1.3B for China, riding buzz from Facebook and IPOs

Matt Marshall April 1, 2011 1:37 PM







IDG-Accel, a joint venture between media giant IDG and venture capital firm Accel Partners, has finished raising two new China funds totaling $1.3 billion.
The warchest is significantly larger than the joint venture has raised in the past, because China’s market is on fire, said an IDG-Accel partner Hugo Shong in an interview. There are more than 500 million users of the internet in China now, up from just 300 million such users in 2005, when the joint venture first started investing in China. Not only are the internet, digital media, e-commerce and mobile markets growing quickly, but so are other areas such as healthcare and cleantech, he said.
We’ve known about the fund-raising for some time, but the announcement confirms the amount. We’re hearing Accel plans to announce yet another fund, likely for its U.S. activities.
The IDG-Accel China funds are as follows: A $550 million fund for early-stage and fast-growing companies, called the IDG-Accel China Growth Fund III, and a $750 million fund for later stage and pre-IPO investments, called China Capital Fund II.
IDG, a media firm that has invested in China since the early 1990s, has benefited from its early presence in China, bolstering its reputation after investing in big deals such as Baidu, Tencent, Ctrip and DangDang. DangDang alone is rumored to have returned at least $200 million to IDG. And Accel, the first venture firm to invest serious capital into Facebook, brings its Silicon Valley expertise to the table.
Shong noted the coincidental growth of the IDG-Accel fund sizes to match the growth — almost exactly — of the number of internet users in China. In 2005, the first IDG-Accel fund was only $300 million, back when the number of Internet users was 300 million.
The steadily rising fund sizes in China contrast with a tapering off or even decline of fund sizes in the United States.
The IDG-Accel alliance has seen seven of its portfolio companies file to go public or get acquired so far (Han Ting, Andon Health, Kang Hui, RDA, Golden Sun, ChangAn and Soufun). But the IPOs only listed over the past year, and so insider “lock up” agreements prevent IDG-Accel from cashing in its investments until later this year. Things are going so well, Shong said, that the joint venture expects to see seven to ten more IPOs this year.

Introductory Note 
 
This Amendment No.1 to Schedule 13D (the
“Amendment No. 1”) amends and supplements the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons with the SEC on February
5, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”). Except as amended and supplemented herein, the information set forth in the
Original Schedule 13D remains unchanged. Capitalized terms used herein have meanings as assigned thereto in the Original Schedule
13D unless defined herein.
 
  
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.
 
Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
On February 5, 2016, IDG Growth II and IDG
Investors II entered into a consortium agreement (the “Consortium Agreement”) with Leilei Wang, the chairman and chief
executive officer of the Issuer, Right Advance Management Ltd and Chiming Bells International Limited (collectively, the “Chairman
Parties”, and together with IDG Growth II and IDG Investors II, the “Consortium”), pursuant to which the Consortium
will cooperate in good faith in connection with an acquisition transaction (the “Transaction”) with respect to the
Issuer. The Consortium Agreement provides, among other things, for: cooperation in arranging financing; engaging advisors; admission
of new Consortium members; cooperation in obtaining applicable governmental, statutory, regulatory or other approvals, licenses,
waivers or exemptions for the consummation of the transactions; and cooperation in preparing definitive documentation with respect
to the Transaction. During the period beginning on the date of the Consortium Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) the 12-month
anniversary of the date of the Consortium Agreement and (ii) the termination of the Consortium Agreement on the occurrence of other
termination events, members of the Consortium have agreed to work exclusively with each other with respect to the Transaction and
not to (a) make a competing proposal for the acquisition of control of the Issuer or (b) acquire or dispose of any securities
of the Issuer.
 
On February 17, 2016, 上海宏流资产管理中心(有限合伙)(Shanghai
Trend Asset Management Center (Limited Partnership)) (“Shanghai Trend”), a PRC limited partnership, signed an adherence
agreement to the Consortium Agreement (the “Shanghai Trend Adherence Agreement”), pursuant to which Shanghai Trend
joined the Consortium. References to the “Consortium” or “Consortium Members” after February 17, 2016
shall include Shanghai Trend. 
 
IDG Growth II and Leilei Wang have previously
submitted a preliminary non-binding proposal (the “Proposal”) to the Issuer’s board of directors in connection
with the Transaction. Under the Proposal, members of the Consortium proposed to acquire, through an acquisition vehicle to be formed
by them, all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company and ADSs not owned by them for US$8.56 per ADS or US$0.2140 per
ordinary share in cash, representing a premium of 21.8% to the closing price of the Issuer’s ADSs on June 26, 2015 and a
premium of approximately 20% to the average closing price of the Issuer’s ADSs during the last 30 trading days. The Proposal
also provides that, among other things, the Consortium will negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Transaction
that will include provisions typical for transactions of this type.
 
If the Transaction is completed, the Issuer’s
ADSs would be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the Issuer’s obligation to file periodic reports under the
Act would terminate. In addition, consummation of the Transaction could result in one or more of the actions specified in clauses
(a)-(j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, including the acquisition or disposition of securities of the Issuer, a merger or other extraordinary
transaction involving the Issuer, a change to the board of directors of the Issuer (as the surviving company in the merger), and
a change in the Issuer’s memorandum and articles of association to reflect that the Issuer would become a privately held
company.
 


 
 

 
Other than as described above, none of
the Reporting Persons currently has any plans or proposals that relate to, or would result in, any of the matters listed in Items
4(a)–(j) of Schedule 13D, although the Reporting Persons may, at any time and from time to time, review or reconsider their
position and/or change their purpose and/or formulate plans or proposals with respect thereto. As a result of these activities,
one or more of the Reporting Persons may suggest or take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations, management,
or capital structure of the Issuer as a means of enhancing shareholder value. Such suggestions or positions may include one or
more plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions required to be reported herein, including, without
limitation, such matters as acquiring additional securities of the Issuer or disposing of securities of the Issuer; entering into
an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;
selling or transferring a material amount of assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; changing the present board of directors
or management of the Issuer, including changing the number or term of directors or filling any existing vacancies on the board
of directors; materially changing the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; materially changing the Issuer’s
business or corporate structure; changing the Issuer’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws or instruments corresponding
thereto or taking other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person; causing a class of securities
of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer
quotation system of a registered national securities association; causing a class of equity securities of the Issuer to become
eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Act; and taking any action similar to
any of those enumerated above.
 

 
 

 
References to the Consortium Agreement and
the Shanghai Trend Adherence Agreement in this statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Consortium Agreement
and the Shanghai Trend Adherence Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2 and 3 and incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety.
  
Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
with respect to Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 6 of the Original Schedule 13D is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
The Consortium Agreement and the Shanghai
Trend Adherence Agreement, which have been filed as Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3 to this statement, are incorporated herein by reference
in their entirety. In addition, the information set forth in Items 3, 4 and 5 of this statement is incorporated by reference in
its entirety into this Item 6. To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, except as provided herein, there are no other contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the Reporting Persons and between any of the Reporting
Persons and any other person with respect to any securities of the Issuer, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or
calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency,
the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the securities of the Issuer.

("IDG) to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company not owned by them or their affiliates (the "Transaction") for US$8.56 in cash per American depositary share ("ADS", each representing forty ordinary shares), or approximately US$0.2140 per ordinary share, which represents a premium of approximately 20% to  the average closing price of the Company's ADSs over the last 30 trading days  and a premium of approximately 21.8% to the closing price of the Company's ADS on June 26, 2015, the last trading day.

The Board of Directors
KongZhong Corporation
35th Floor, Tengda Plaza
No. 168 Xizhimenwai Street
Beijing, China 100044
The People's Republic of China
Dear Members of the Board of Directors,
We, Leilei Wang, chairman and chief executive officer of KongZhong Corporation (the "Company"), and IDG-Accel China Growth  Fund II L.P. ("IDG")or its affiliates (together with Leilei Wang and such other third party entities as designated and approved  by Leilei Wang and IDG,  the "Consortium Members"), are pleased to submit this preliminary non-binding proposal (the "Proposal") to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company that are not already owned by us on the principal terms and conditions described in this letter (the "Transaction").
We believe that our Proposal provides a very attractive opportunity to the Company's shareholders. Our Proposal represents a premium of 21.8% to the closing price of the Company's American depositary shares ("ADSs", every ADS representing 40 ordinary shares) on June 26, 2015 and a premium of 20 % to the average closing price of the Company's ADSs during the last 30 trading days.
Set forth below are the key terms of our Proposal.
1. Consortium. The Consortium Members will form an acquisition vehicle for the purpose of implementing the Transaction. Please also note that the Consortium Members who are shareholders are currently interested only in pursuing the Transaction and are not interested in selling their shares in any other transaction involving the Company.
2. Transaction and Purchase Price. We propose to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company and ADSs not already owned by us at a purchase price equal to US$0.2124 per ordinary share, or US$8.56 per ADS, as the case may be, in cash through a one-step merger of an acquisition vehicle newly formed by the Consortium Members with and into the Company.
3. Financing. We intend to finance the Transaction with a combination of debt and/or equity capital. Equity financing will be provided by the Consortium Members, in the form of cash and rollover equity in the Company, and from any additional equity investor who may be admitted as a Consortium Member. Debt financing is expected to be provided by loans from third party financial institutions. We are confident that we can timely secure adequate financing to consummate the Transaction.
4. Due Diligence. We believe that we will be in a position to complete customary due diligence for the Transaction in a timely manner and in parallel with discussions on definitive agreements.
5. Definitive Agreements. We have engaged Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as our international legal counsel and are prepared to promptly provide and negotiate definitive agreements for the Transaction.
6. Process. We believe that the Transaction will provide superior value to the Company's public shareholders. We recognize of course that the board of directors of the Company will evaluate the Transaction independently before it can make its determination whether to endorse it. Given our involvement in the Transaction, we would expect that the independent members of the board of directors will proceed to consider our Proposal and the Transaction.
7. Confidentiality. We are sure you will agree, however, that it is in all of our interests to ensure that we otherwise proceed in a strictly confidential manner, unless otherwise required by law, until we have executed definitive agreements or terminated our discussions.
8. No Binding Commitment. This Proposal is not a binding offer, agreement or agreement to make a binding offer or agreement at any point in the future. This letter is a preliminary indication of interest by the Consortium Members and does not contain all matters upon which agreement must be reached in order to consummate the proposed Transaction, nor does it create any binding rights or obligations in favor of any person. The parties will be bound only upon the execution of mutually agreeable definitive documentation.
9. Governing Law. This letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.
***
In closing, we would like to express our commitment to working together to bring this Transaction to a successful and timely conclusion. Should you have any questions regarding this Proposal, please do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
/s/ Leilei Wang

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
