Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

10 Reasons to Buy Veeva Systems Inc. Stock and Never Sell
The first is the most important, and I truly hope the last never comes true.











                Brian Stoffel
            

                (TMFCheesehead)



            
            Jul 22, 2017 at 12:03PM
            
            





A little over a decade ago, Peter Gassner was an executive at salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). While he was out pushing the company's cloud services, he noticed something: The pharmaceutical industry had very specific needs that salesforce.com couldn't easily meet.
Taking that information, he left salesforce.com to found Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), where he still functions as the company's CEO. He started his work with Veeva CRM, a customer relationship management tool for Big Pharma. Then he really hit it out of the park with Veeva Vault, a product that helps companies manage -- in the simplest sense -- all of the data that they need to track to obtain FDA approval for their drugs.

Image source: Getty Images

I first purchased shares of Veeva in January of 2014, have added to it since, and have no plans to sell. Here are 10 reasons why:
1. It's got a strong moat
Imagine having all of your customer information on one platform. Then imagine having all of the data that you've collected from test results on the same platform. Now imagine you have to transfer all of that data to another platform.
The horror!
Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, it would also create massive headaches. Entire workforces would have to be retrained on a new system. And if any of this mission-critical data were lost, it would be a major liability. In the investing world, we call those high switching costs.
2. Momentum is strong 
Of course, high switching costs mean absolutely nothing if you can't win over customers in the first place. Luckily for Veeva investors, however, momentum has been very strong.
Veeva's Growth Across Service ProductsCreate column charts
Perhaps most importantly, the number of Vault customers using more than one Vault application grew 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2017.





3. Optionality abounds
Optionality is a complicated word for a simple concept: Make lots of small bets and look for just one or two to hit it big. After you see how a small bet performs, you have the option to either pursue it further or kill it.
For the first time, Veeva is really branching out on a small bet it recently made. Word of mouth about the ease and functionality of Veeva Vault has led companies outside of Big Pharma to start asking for a version that they can use. Specifically, this demand has come from industries that are heavily regulated: consumer packaged goods (CPG), chemicals, and manufacturing.
Starting this year, Vault QualityOne, a hybrid Vault product, is on the market for companies outside of life sciences to use. Already, a top-five CPG company has signed on.
4. Management has skin in the game
No one knows more about the hidden risks of a company than those that are managing it. That's why I think it's so important to invest in companies where management has their own skin in the game via stock ownership.
Peter Gassner owns almost 15 million Class B shares, while co-founder Gordon Ritter owns nearly 7 million. Combined, these two control just under 50% of all voting rights, and their stake is currently worth $1.4 billion.





5. I love founder-led companies
As you can tell, I'm a fan of skin in the game. But there's a class above skin in the game. Best-selling author and trader Nassim Taleb calls it having your "soul in the game." That's when someone takes risks on behalf of the greater community.
That's what we have with Gassner: Most of his wealth is tied up in Veeva. But beyond that, founders often view their companies as extensions of themselves, and are committed to building lasting value.
6. Employees seem to like it
While some think culture isn't important and impossible to measure, I'd point you toward Glassdoor.com. While the site isn't perfect -- and is certainly open to manipulation -- it offers an important data point for those wanting to learn about the morale of a company.
Currently, Veeva has pretty solid marks across the board.

7. There's a strong balance sheet with positive cash flows
Every company, at one point or another, is going to go through difficult economic times. Those that have solid balance sheets and positive cash flows can often emerge from these times even stronger. That's because they can acquire weaker rivals, buy back shares on the cheap, or -- most importantly -- offer deals that the competition can't, and steal long-term market share.
Here's what the story looks like for Veeva right now.

That's financial fortitude!
8. Customer concentration is low
Companies that have solid balance sheets like that are in great shape. But they sometimes hide a dangerous risk -- relying on just a few customers for a huge part of their revenue. When that's the case, all it takes is one decision coming from one person to sink a company overnight.
Luckily for Veeva, that's not the current situation. As the chart in the second point above shows, it has hundreds of different customers, and no single customer currently accounts for more than 10% of total revenues for the past three years.
9. Who knows what will be next?
Three years ago, CRM accounted for virtually all sales. Almost overnight, Vault has become an enormous contributor.
Veeva Revenue by SegmentCreate column charts
Veeva's two newer products -- OpenData and Network -- probably won't hit the ball out of the park quite like Vault, but they don't have to. The company continues to innovate, and with each new customer, the moat surrounding Veeva widens.
10. A takeover candidate?
Personally, I wouldn't be a very big fan of a takeover. I think Veeva has enormous potential moving forward -- with the move outside of Big Pharma being a cherry on top.
But the fact remains that Veeva clearly has a lot of momentum going for it. That's tempting to a lot of deep-pocketed competitors in the cloud space. While the stock certainly seems expensive right now, I wouldn't at all be surprised to see a cloud giant swoop in and pay around $10 billion for Veeva.
So there you have it, 10 reasons I own and plan to hold on to Veeva Systems stock -- and why you might want to consider the stock as well.

These 3 Tech Leaders Are Within 2% Of Buy Points; Can Nasdaq Go To 11? 






ED CARSON
7/21/2017


 Reprints




Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were little changed early Friday morning following a flurry of big earnings releases, including Dow stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V). Meanwhile, three top-rated techs — Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple-chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and Salesforce.com (CRM) — have moved within 2% of proper buy points.
XAutoplay: On | OffNasdaq 100 futures fell fractionally vs. fair value, suggesting a threat to the Nasdaq composite's 10-day winning streak. Microsoft's blowout earnings didn't help after the software and cloud giant gave cautious revenue guidance. S&P 500 index and Dow futures were little changed.
Alphabet
Alphabet fell 0.1% to 992.19 in Thursday's stock market trading. It's close to a 1,008.71 buy point in a flat base. Aggressive investors could treat 994.09 as an alternative entry, which Alphabet edged past during the last two sessions but has not closed above.
Alphabet, which reports earnings next week, relies on search advertising revenue for the majority of its revenue. But cloud computing is a notable growth area, even though Google doesn't break that revenue out from "other" activities. Analysts say Google and especially Microsoft are gaining market share faster than industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Amazon Web Services division. Microsoft credited its June quarter's outperformance largely on cloud computing.
Microsoft, for its part, closed Thursday at 74.22, above a recent 72.99 buy point. Shares rose modestly in premarket trading Friday.
As for the other FANG internet stocks, Amazon, Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) have all hit record highs this week.
Broadcom
Broadcom held up better than most other Apple chipmakers, only dropping below its 50-day moving average in late June and quickly regaining that support level in July. Broadcom fell 0.4% to 253.43 on Thursday, but is still just over 1% below a 256.88 buy point.
Broadcom fell by a sliver in late trading following earnings of fellow Apple-chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Skyworks reported accelerating earnings and revenue growth, topping forecasts and giving strong guidance for the current quarter. But Skyworks fell about 3% late.
Salesforce.com
The on-demand cloud-computing software pioneer rose 1.1% to 90.54, closing in on a 92.09 buy point from a flat base. An aggressive investor could treat 90.87 as an alternative entry.
Salesforce's relative strength line, which tracks its performance vs. the S&P 500, is not as impressive as that of Alphabet and Broadcom. It's not a laggard, but it hasn't been a market leader either.

The Short Case For Hubspot - HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Short Case For HubspotJul. 6.17 | About: HubSpot, Inc. (HUBS) Short Biased Common Stock, Short




SummaryTAM is small and competition is high - market saturation makes consensus revenue unlikely.Unit economics challenged and misunderstood - near-term profitability unlikely.Everyone is bullish - high risk asymmetry given peak valuation and no intrinsic value.Relevant Comps Bazaarvoice, Inc. (NASDAQ:BV) Callidus Software Inc. (NASDAQ:CALD) ChannelAdvisor Corporation (NYSE:ECOM) Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO) Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) Catalyst Q1’17 (reports May 2 post-close) will be important since first evidence of new product adoption and effectiveness of salesforce reorganization that happened in Q4 '16. The company over-earned in Q4 and working capital suggests Q1 results are under pressure. Management could use reporting tricks (they did in Q4 '16) or M&A to confuse the market for one more quarter, in which case, Q2 '17 earnings is the catalyst. Short: Hubspot, Inc. (HUBS) (the “Company” or “Hubspot”), $2.3B Market Cap, 6.3x FY2017E Revenue, 5.0x FY2018E Revenue Executive Summary  Hubspot sells marketing and CRM software-as-a-service (SaaS). It went public in Oct. ‘14 and has enjoyed a 52% 3-year revenue CAGR by selling to “SMBs” that are usually buying their first digital marketing solution. Hubspot is not profitable. The Street thinks the company has <1% share in an underserved market with room for competition - a rising tide lifts all ships. Investors are thinking the new CRM product and salesforce reorg is a swing factor for Q1’17 top line - 35-40% ‘17 growth baked in.  Reasons to short:  Hubspot has been driven down-market by larger competitors, is selling a commoditized, low-tech product and is getting squeezed on pricing by well-funded startups and enterprise freemium models. Unit economics are bad and the recent margin deterioration has been offset by channel sales, which have plateaued. Customer net adds are decelerating and hidden by a change in disclosure. Limited downside to a company trading at all-time and SaaS industry highs with no takeout risk. 
 Potential Return: ~50% upside to shorting HUBS under the base case using a weighted average revenue multiple and DCF. 

 Primary Research Highlights  Calls/meetings with SaaS VCs, SaaS M&A bankers, top 2 digital consulting partners, top 3 competitor execs. Demoed Hubspot and competitor products; interviewed 4 Hubspot customers, 14 partners, and 4 former employees.  Tracking plan: Q1’17 (reports May 2 post-close) will be important since first evidence of new product adoption and effectiveness of salesforce reorganization; management could use reporting tricks or M&A to buy one more quarter. Pre-mortem: High paid CRM attach rates in Q1’17 and better disclosure of churn and net new customer adds for the core product. Thesis Points   TAM is small and competition is high - market saturation makes consensus revenue unlikely.  Unit economics challenged and misunderstood - near-term profitability unlikely.  Everyone is bullish - high risk asymmetry given peak valuation and no intrinsic value.  

 Secondary Investment Points  Network channel partners are highly concentrated - only 50 account for 90% of sales, so 35% of total revenue. Hubspot was in a legal battle with Salesforce and API contract expires in 2020 - 75%+ potential downside if expired. Account-Based Marketing is replacing Inbound Marketing as most effective web-based approach to lead generation. Top-tier forensic accounting firm expected to publish short report on HUBS after Q1 earnings - potential secondary catalyst. Weak management team and reputation - expose published in ‘16; CTO barely in office; confusing exec titles, and turnover is high. 
 Thesis Point 1: Small Actual TAM And Competitive Squeeze  Street says the company has <1% of ~$45B TAM and long runway - consensus 23% 2016-2019 CAGR. Management says it’s focused on customers with 10-2,000 headcount, but former employees, customers, and channel partners say the product is for 10-50 employees and <$10m revenue. Hubspot leads this segment, but lacks tech or pricing advantage over segment rivals, which are moving into this market. Up-market is saturated with more sophisticated technology and down-market is competitive and unprofitable. Hubspot pricing is being squeezed on both ends as enterprise giants and VCs subsidize freemium models to gain share. CRM market is even more competitive; Hubspot’s dog-and-pony “rebranding” won’t improve cross-sale uptake, and ARPU growth could turn negative (consensus growth is mid-teens) in 2017.  

 Thesis Point 2: No Path To Profitability  Hubspot guides to OCF and points to 100% dollar retention, but these are the wrong metrics to focus on. The Company capitalizes software (2% revenue) and continues to open new offices. Dollar retention is misleading because of early discounts and upgrades - actual churn is high (low 80s reported, I was told 70s)   The best metric to measure SaaS unit economics is CLTV/CAC (lifetime value to acquisition cost) and Hubspot has been unable to grow this ratio beyond 1.5x, while 3x is the industry’s “magic number.” Hubspot books ~50% of its revenue through marketing agencies who act as value-added resellers (VARs). Hubspot pays a 20% commission for each sale, but starts recording revenue from resales at least a quarter before recording the commissions as S&M expense. In some instances, Hubspot records revenue net of commissions altogether. I believe that Hubspot’s true operating margins are between 5-10% lower than reported. 
 

 Valuation  HUBS trades at 6.2x ‘17 consensus revenue; there are 18 buy ratings and 2 holds. I model base case ’17-‘18 revenue below the Street and ascribe a 3.5x ‘18 multiple which gets an implied share price of $38 at EY2017 reflecting a 41% return (54% annualized).  I add a 10-year DCF to my base case operating model with margins approaching management’s long-term guidance. The base case DCF implies a share price of $29 reflecting a 55% return (69% annualized).  My reward case shows another half-turn of multiple contraction, which I think is reasonable in an 18% growth scenario. This implies a 54% return. My risk case shows a multiple expansion to 6.5x and above-consensus growth and implies an 18% loss on a short.  Key Risks And Mitigating Factors  Outperformance: The company has beaten the top line every Q since the IPO - the stock has never responded more than 2%. Salesforce risk: Rumor that a Salesforce deck leaked and included Hubspot as a potential target, but former employees describe the relationship with Salesforce as fractured. Industry contacts say Salesforce has been giving its Pardot (HUBS competitors) product away for free and eating into Hubspot's customer base. Other strategic buyer risk: Hubspot competitors have already been acquired by enterprise software or PE (see next page) so they aren’t interested. SaaS M&A bankers argue that 1) “SMB is uninteresting to enterprise;” 2) “no one wants to buy a company selling through channel partners;” and, 3) “Everyone knows Hubspot has no real tech.” PE (“Vista’d”) risk: Vista already bought key competitor Marketo and Marketo told me they aren’t interested. There are other pockets of SaaS-focused capital but high churn, competitive pricing pressure, and shifting industry trends are gating issues. International growth - recently opened Japan office, etc., and large channel partners in Spain. This could help them meet near-term numbers but very few SaaS companies have successfully scaled into Europe’s highly fragmented customer bases 
 



 Model Assumptions – Base Case  (5%) net new customer growth in ‘17-‘18, in line with ‘16 growth normalized for INBOUND conference in 3Q. Flat ARPU, reflecting pricing pressure and customer size shrinkage.  Sample Next Steps  Speak to Salesforce/Pardot about platform integration, move down-market, and competition. Speak to marketing automation competitors and Account-Based Marketing agencies and platforms to gauge growth across categories. Survey agency partners on client ROI on marketing and sales products and conversion of new CRM product. Q1 ’17 earnings: watch SaaS unit economics (see next page).  Appendix Growth drivers negative  Net add deceleration hidden by a change in reporting - the company started including freemium customers in net add numbers. ARPU growth decelerating.  Unit economics deterioration  CAC ratio declining. Employee efficiency down.  Working capital flags  Stretching terms to meet. Billings growth slows.  

 Most expensive non-enterprise SaaS company  Second highest expected forward growth but also most competitive and least sticky customer base (digital marketing < CRM). Second worst economics. 
 Trading above takeout threshold Even if buyers saw value in Hubspot, current valuation + premium is above historic M&A threshold.

BI GraphicsBusinesses spend a huge wad of cash every year on tech. They'll dole out $3.5 trillion in 2017 alone, according to Gartner. 
2017 has seen a dramatic increase in cloud spending and the rise of new technologies in the work place like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.
It's seen a crop of new public companies, and some startups that are leading the way in their areas. At the same time, powerhouses like Cisco, Oracle and Microsoft still dominate their respective markets.
And with that kind of money comes power and lots of it.
So here's a shout-out for the 52 people shaping the multitrillion-dollar world of enterprise tech in 2017.

No. 52: Eric Yuan, cofounder & CEO, Zoom
Zoom
Eric Yuan started off 2017 with a $1 billion valuation thanks to a $100 million funding round led by A-list VC Sequoia Capital. 
Yuan, who formed Zoom after becoming frustrated in his role as VP of Engineering at Cisco's WebEx, saw a hole in the market to reach smaller companies. 
Today, Zoom has become a real contender in the business video communications market.





No. 51: Rob Mee, CEO, Pivotal
Pivotal
Rob Mee helms Pivotal, the big data startup spun out from EMC in 2012. 
Mee cut his teeth in the artificial intelligence world and founded Pivotal Labs, which was acquired by EMC in October, 2013. And then his team, along with a few other cloud and big-data companies that EMC and its subsidiary VMware acquired, were bundled together and spun out to form a new company, taking the name Pivotal. 
Pivotal was originally led by industry bigwig and former VMware CEO Paul Maritz. Maritz was talked into launching it instead of retiring. But Maritz didn't push off retirement forever, and Mee, part of Pivotal’s founding team, got the corner office in 2015.
The company is making a name for itself building custom big-data and cloud apps for Fortune 500 companies and said it booked $100 million in revenues when Mee took the helm.





No. 50: Andrew Ng, founder, Deeplearning.ai
Dawn Endico/Flickr
Andrew Ng is one of the fathers of artificial intelligence as it is increasingly used by businesses.
Andrew Ng is widely known as creator of the Google Brain, Google's massive AI system that companies can access for their own apps by using Google's cloud. Ng did a shocking thing in 2014 and defected to Google's major Chinese competitor, Baidu, where he worked on AI projects there.
He left Baidu in April and is now working on a much-watched, stealth startup called Deeplearning.ai, which is undertaking the "AI transformation of our society," as Ng described.
Ng is also known as a cofounder of free online education site Coursera and he wrote one of the popular AI trainings courses of all time, teaching the next generation of AI coders.





No. 49: Neeraj Agrawal, general partner, Battery Ventures
Battery Ventures
Neeraj Agrawal is general partner at Battery Ventures, where he's been a powerhouse in the enterprise world, investing in some of the most successful software as a service (SaaS), since 2000. 
This year, one of the companies he backed, AppDynamics, hit it out of the park when it was acquired by Cisco just as it was on the verge of an IPO. 
He also backed Coupa and Nutanix, both newly public companies, and he's currently invested in industry hotshots like Glassdoor and Sprinklr.





No. 48: Jacqueline Reses, capital lead and people lead, Square
Fortune Brainstorm TECH
Jack Dorsey may be most famous as the CEO of Twitter but it is the other company he founded, Square, that's been skyrocketing for investors in 2017.
There are a lot of reasons for that but one of them is Jacqueline Reses, the former investment banker and former Yahoo M&A/HR queen who now works at Square.
Reses joined Square in 2015 where she was again tapped for a dual role. She leads HR and recruiting, as well as Square's all-important Square Capital team, which offers loans to small business.
Shares of Square have been on a tear all summer, in large part because of the success of Square Capital.





No. 47: Bridget van Kralingen, SVP of Industry Platforms, IBM
IBM
Bridget van Kralingen has long been one of IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's most trusted lieutenants.
Now Rometty has tasked her to lead two of IBM's most important initiatives, as the venerable company reboots itself into the new worlds of cloud computing and AI.
Van Kralingen is leading the "Industry Platforms" unit, charged with coming up with AI and cloud apps for individual industries, as a way to lure them onto IBM's cloud.
She's also leading IBM's foray into a young technology called "blockchain." Blockchain is a way to securely store information across many distributed computer systems and was pioneered by the online currency Bitcoin.
Blockchain has the potential to set the tech industry on fire, and IBM is known as one of the leaders of the tech, with van Kralingen at the helm.





No. 46: Adam Blitzer, EVP & GM of Sales and Service Clouds, Salesforce
Salesforce
Adam Blitzer is executive vice president of Sales Cloud, Salesforce’s bread and butter product.
Sales Cloud accounted for $3 billion in revenues for the company in fiscal year 2017. That’s almost 40% of overall subscription and support revenues, which means Blitzer has his hand on the money. 
And he's also running Service Cloud, the company's popular help desk software.
Blitzer first joined Salesforce in 2013 through an acquisition. He sold his B2B marketing automation company Pardot to ExactTarget in 2012 for $100 million. ExactTarget was then acquired by Salesforce for $2.5 billion in 2013. Now, he’s one of the most powerful people at the company and in the cloud.
 
 





No. 45: David Goeckeler, SVP & GM of Networking and Security, Cisco
Cisco
David Goeckeler has become key player in Cisco CEO Chuck Robbin's brain trust.
He's the man leading Cisco's two most important units, networking and security, responsible for $32 billion of the company's $50 billion in revenue. 
He's also the man behind the networking giant's overhaul of its critical network business, an initiative called Network Intuitive. Revealed in June, this is a set of new hardware and software which combine AI and programmable chips to create next-generation network switches. 
Cisco hopes that this new system will allow it to combat a rising tide of startups and competitors who are trying to upend its market dominance.





No. 44: Brendan Burns, partner architect, Microsoft
Microsoft
Brendan Burns holds the title of partner architect at Microsoft but its his work at his former employer, Google, that's made him powerful.
While at Google, Burns created a tech called Kubernetes, one of the most popular open source projects of all time.
Kubernetes is used by programmers to manage bits of apps known as containers. Containers have changed the way programmers write apps for the cloud and Kubernetes has become a critical technology for Google as it tries to become a cloud powerhouse, challenging the likes of Amazon Web Services.
When Microsoft poached Burns in 2016 to work for Microsoft's cloud, Azure, it was a major coup.
Burns is now heading up engineering for Microsoft’s container efforts.





No. 43: Ryan Smith, cofounder & CEO, Qualtrics
Qualtrics
Qualtrics offers online survey and marketing software and is a family-run business, with Ryan Smith at its helm. It was co-founded by Smith's father and a BYU professor, Scott Smith, and Smith's brother, Jared Smith, an early Google employee.
Years ago, the Smiths bootstrapped their company from $0-$50 million and that's when VCs and other software giants took notice. Five years ago, the Smiths turned down a $500 million acquisition offer. They wanted to grow their company themselves.
Flash forward to 2017, and the company raised a $180 million round that valued the company at $2.5 billion, bringing the total funding to $400 million in just three rounds. 
Although Qualtrics is based in Provo, Utah, far away from Silicon Valley, the Smith boys run with the A-list Valley crowd. Smith is even counseled by famed Valley CEO coach Kim Scott.





No. 42: Solomon Hykes, CTO & chief maintainer, Docker
Anthony Harvey/Getty
Containers are a tech that helps programmers easily write apps for the cloud and are all the rage in enterprise tech. And Docker CTO Solomon Hykes remains the man of the hour in this niche.
Thanks to Hykes, containers have become so popular that there's a war going on between Docker and other would-be Dockers over this new container market.
This year, Docker launched a new open source community called The Moby Project, which it hopes will encourage more developers to roll up their sleeves and work on its container technology, rather than its competitors'.
It's clear that Hykes is looking to keep Docker at the center of the revolution he started.





No. 41: Nick McKeown, chief scientist & chairman, Barefoot Networks
Standford
Nick McKeown is a renowned professor at Stanford University that was one of the key people to help usher in a whole new way to build computer networks based on software. 
He earned his wealth when his startup Nicera (cofounded with other network industry legends Martin Casado and Scott Shenker) was acquired back in 2012 for $1.2 billion. He's now quietly involved in angel investing, backing up-and-comers like SnapRoute and Kumru.
His latest startup, Barefoot Networks, is credited with being the next big disrupter in the network industry. Barefoot Networks sells an ultra fast chip for computer networks that can be reprogrammed, allowing networks to be customized.
The company launched in June 2016 with much applause, and market-leader Cisco launched its own programmable switch just one year later in response.





No. 40: Chris Wanstrath, cofounder & CEO, Github
Brian Ach/Getty Images
GitHub is the place where developers store, share and work on their apps, whether these apps are from newbie programmers or major players like Apple, IBM or Microsoft.
As a cofounder and CEO, Chris Wanstrath has had his share of growing up moments as GitHub fielded accusations that depict a rough work culture. So the Valley is closely watching his efforts to revamp it into a more diverse and accepting place.
Nevertheless, GitHub has become one of the most important companies in the world of programming today. It claims 22 million programmers as members, and 117,000 businesses use it to track their software projects as well. 





No. 39: Drew Houston, CEO, Dropbox
Kimberly White / Getty Images
The rumor mill is spinning that Dropbox is inching closer to an IPO, which could be the biggest public offering since Snapchat.
So founder CEO Drew Houston must now grow Dropbox into a company worth big investment money.
He's been preparing for his company's success his whole life. 
Houston built the $10 billion company from scratch after a frustrating experience in which he forgot his thumb drive at home. Now he's changed the way businesses store and share documents, and is lining up big partners like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise along the way.





No. 38: Alex Karp, CEO, Palantir
Getty / Drew Angerer
Karp leads Palantir, known as Silicon Valley's most secretive company, choosing to keep both its data-mining technology and its client list, many of whom are government agencies, under tight wraps.
Palantir has raised so much money from private investors, it is valued it at $20 billion. 
Karp is powerful for another reason: a direct line to Donald Trump's White House. Legendary investor Peter Thiel, one of Trump's very few prominent supporters in Silicon Valley, is a cofounder of Palantir. It's a connection that earned Karp a seat on the American Technology Council, which held its first meeting on June 19. 
It was there at Karp floated the notion that Palantir's style of big data analysis could stop fraudulent spending in the federal government.





No. 37: Jayshree Ullal, CEO, Arista Networks
Arista
Arista Networks is taking on network industry Goliath Cisco and having a lot of success.
Arista is seen as a more flexible alternative to Cisco and has seen double digital growth in revenues at a time when Cisco is experiencing declines. 
CEO Jayshree Ullal was a former Cisco star before joining Arista in 2008, and bringing the company public in 2014. 
Cisco isn't taking the rise of Arista lightly and has sued the company for patent infringement and lodged complaints with the International Trade Commission. But that hasn't scared off buyers or investors. The profitable company has seen its shares triple since its 2014 IPO.





No. 36 & No. 35 Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, cofounders & co-CEOs, Atlassian
Mike Cannon-Brookes (left) and Scott Farquhar (right)Atlassian
Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes have created an $8 billion teamwork software titan in Atlassian. They are now gunning to take on Microsoft Office with the $425 million acquisition of Trello in January.
When Atlassian filed for its 2015 IPO, it revealed that it had been consistently profitable since the decade previous—without doing a single round of traditional venture capital financing, 
And Atlassian got there without a traditional outbound sales team, instead relying largely on word-of-mouth. 
The company startled investors when it swung to a loss for its fiscal 2016. But it is spending into the red to develop more software products for more businesses, it explained.
Meanwhile, Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes are like the Mark Zuckerbergs of their home country Australia, the youngest Australian billionaires on Forbes' 2017 list.





No: 34: Jason Taylor, VP of Infrastructure, Facebook
LinkedIn/Jason Taylor
Jason Taylor leads the team that manages Facebook's enormous infrastructure, the tech that supports 2 billion Facebook users worldwide.
That's a powerful job but that's only the beginning. He is also the chairman and president of arguably Facebook's biggest contribution to the tech world, the Open Compute Project.
OCP creates open source hardware for data centers. Anyone can contribute to the designs and use them for free, with contract manufacturers standing by to build the hardware. OCP hardware is cheaper, easier to repair, and greener than buying it from traditional makers, it says.
OCP has created a cult-like following and now Taylor is man leading the crowd.





No. 33: Jay Parikh, VP of Infrastructure, Facebook
Facebook
Facebook isn't exactly the first name you think of when you think of telecommunications equipment but that could one day change.
Under VP of Infrastructure Jay Parikh, Facebook has taken its home-built innovations in telecom and computer networks and created a consortium called the Telecom Infrastructure Project.
TIP is modeled after Facebook's other successful project in this area, the Open Compute Project. TIP's goal is nothing less than to disrupt the $350 billion telecom equipment market.
And Parikh is the liaison between the brave new world Facebook envisions and the rest of the telecom industry.





No. 32: Jeff Lawson, cofounder & CEO, Twilio
John Phillips/Getty Images
Twilio is one of the companies that secretly runs the internet: Its services let apps and websites send you text messages or make phone calls. If you've ever gotten a text from Uber saying your car is getting close, or a phone call from Netflix to verify your account, you've used Twilio.
Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson, a long-time industry veteran formerly at Amazon Web Services and StubHub, has seen saw his influence grow since he took his company public in 2016. 
In 2017, Twilio ranked eighth on Fast Company's list of the world's 50 Most Innovative Companies alongside heavyweights like Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Apple, Snap, Facebook, and Netflix.
While the stock got pummeled earlier this year after warnings that big customer Uber would be cutting back, Lawson is already leading a rebound in investor confidence.





No. 31: Aaron Levie, CEO, Box
Mike Windle/Getty
Aaron Levie famously had his growing-up moment when Box was a young startup without much revenue and Citrix offered to buy the company for about $600 million. Levie stared down investor pressure to sell and talked his board into turning down the offer.
Flash forward to 2017, and his company now has a market cap of over $2 billion. The cloud file storage and collaboration service reported better-than-expected quarterly results at the end of May, is narrowing losses and upped its guidance for the rest of its 2018 fiscal year. 
Levie has promised investors that Box will be profitable and generating over $1 billion in annual revenue by 2021.
Levie also remains one of the Valley's favorite CEOs. He continues to make a lot of smart moves in the cloud industry and he's always absolutely hilarious. If you don't follow his Twitter account, do yourself a favor and add him.





No. 30: Todd McKinnon, CEO, Okta
Okta
Okta founder and CEO Todd McKinnon became a Wall Street darling in 2017 when he took his company public. The IPO went well, giving the company a $2 billion valuation.
Okta continued to shine after its first earnings report. The strong results sent the $2.3 billion company's stock to a new high, just two months after the successful IPO in which its stock soared 44% on the first day of trading. 
Okta pioneered the idea of a cloud service that makes it easier for companies to manage employee passwords to other cloud services.
McKinnon grew up as an early employee running engineering at Salesforce and now finds that Salesforce and Microsoft are his partners and his competitors.





No. 29: Mike Olson, chief strategy officer, Cloudera
YouTube/stanfordonline
Big data software company Cloudera was one of the most heavily funded enterprise startups of all time, raising about $1.05 billion and being valued by private investors at $4.1 billion.
Cloudera founder, former CEO and current CSO Mike Olson completed the company's much-anticipated IPO in April. The stock did well in its IPO, even though the company's public valuation was half of its last private one, a market cap of about $2.5 billion. 
It didn't matter. Cloudera's biggest private investor, Intel, is happy to keep its large chunk of the company. Cloudera's big data software helps Intel sell more of its chips and servers.
While Cloudera's other founders sold off bits of their stake or left the company, Olsen still owns over 5 million shares, which amounts to 4% of the company. His power in the world of big data computing is secure.





No. 28: Jeff Dean, senior fellow, Google
Google
In 2015, Google's celebrated engineer Jeff Dean created a piece of artificial intelligence software called ­TensorFlow. Two years later, that tool is a major part Google's next major money maker, cloud computing.
TensorFlow makes life easier for engineers looking to build machine-learning and artificially intelligent apps. That's the next big thing in enterprise tech.
Dean was an early employee at Google, and is a legend inside the company. He's created many of Google's most important products, like its first ad servers.
Today he's the head of the core AI research group, which means Dean is building the future of enterprise technology, and the future of machine learning as we know it. 
 





No. 27: Stewart Butterfield, founder, Slack Technologies

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield is continuing his company's multi-year hot streak with some saying that if he wanted to sell his company today, he could command a $9 billion price tag. 
But Butterfield doesn't seem to want to sell. He's reportedly looking for a massive new round of funding, another $500 million, which values the company at $5 billion. That's a bump from the valuation of $3.8 billion in 2016.
Slack's whopping valuation is a testament to its crazy growth: the company has four million daily active users and surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue last year. 
Butterfield is one of the most likable guys in Silicon Valley. With the company poised to see increased competition, Slack will rely on his leadership even more next year.





No. 26: Ben Horowitz, VC, Andreessen/Horowitz
Travis P Ball / Getty
It was a good day for A-list venture capitalist Ben Horowitz when Okta went public earlier this year. 
With Andreessen/Horowitz having chipped in half of Okta's seed money, the VC firm was a big winner in Okta's $2 billion valuation.
Horowitz has backed many winners over the years like Skype, Nicera and AppLogic, and led deals in dozens of other enterprise startups, including Tidemark, Asana and SnapLogic. 
He continues to be a powerful influence in the enterprise world.





No. 25: Jim Goetz, VC & partner, Sequoia

Jim Goetz has long been known as one of the most successful VCs in the industry. Goetz is a partner at Sequoia, and made his name by backing companies like Hubspot, WhatsApp and Palo Alto Networks.
In January, Goetz took a step back from his management responsibilities at the firm and left US operations up to his partner, Roelof Botha. But Goetz is still general partner of existing funds, continues to represent Sequoia in board seats on startups like GitHub, and is still hunting for new startups to back.
Meanwhile, he plans to be enjoying a bit more free time these days, with the purchase of a new Venetian Islands mansion.





No. 24: Aneel Bhusri, CEO, Workday
Financial Times photos via Flickr
Bhusri is CEO and co-founder of Workday, the financial and human management company that is giving the old guards, SAP and Oracle, a run for their money.
The company was founded by Bhusri and PeopleSoft founder David Duffield after they endured one of the ugliest hostile takeovers in software history, when Oracle bought Peoplesoft out from under them. 
Workday, a cloud alternative, was their revenge, and investors have loved the company since its 2013 IPO. Shares have more than doubled to above $100.
Bhusri is powerful for another reason. He's also a VC at Greylock where he's backed such companies as Okta, Cloudera and Zuora.





No. 23: Jim Whitehurst, CEO, Red Hat
Biz Carson/Business Insider
Jim Whitehurst has been CEO of Red Hat for a decade, leading it to become the first and only multi-billion dollar open source software company.
Whitehurst makes sure Red Hat is always in front of the up-and-coming tech. For instance, he was an early supporter of containers. This year, Whitehurst has pushed Red Hat into a unique niche of cloud computing, a service that combines containers and cloud app development in one fell swoop.
Red Hat, which had $2.4 billion in annual revenues for fiscal year 2017, is still the leader in Linux, too, the most popular operating system that owns the data center.





No. 22: Scott Guthrie, EVP of Cloud and Enterprise, Microsoft
Microsoft
Microsoft is betting its entire future on cloud computing, pushing its huge slate of enterprise customers to use Office 365 and its cloud service Azure.
That makes Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft's cloud computing efforts, extremely powerful. He's responsible for Azure as well as Dynamics, Microsoft's competitor to Salesforce, both of which continue to grow in 2017.
And his responsibilities within the company keep growing. Now that Microsoft has completed its $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn, Guthrie's is tasked with integrating LinkedIn with various Microsoft products. 





No. 21: Thomas Kurian, president of product development, Oracle
Flickr/Oracle PR
Thomas Kurian is one of the most powerful men behind Oracle's engineering and some say that he may be the real heir to become the next CEO of Oracle, should Larry Ellison ever decide to retire.
Kurian's influence has been even more on the rise in recent years, as he's responsible for building out the all-important cloud. 
Cloud revenues were $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 — up 61% from 2016. With the success of this growing revenue stream, investors are getting excited, and Oracle is seeing the results on Wall Street. 





No. 20: Shantanu Narayen, CEO, Adobe
Justin Sullivan/Getty
Years ago, Shantanu Narayen made the big decision to stop selling software the old fashioned way and sell it only as a cloud product.
And he recently threw his enormous weight behind Microsoft for a mutually beneficial partnership, with Adobe software living on the Microsoft Azure cloud. 
Microsoft doesn't have a marketing software competitor, and Adobe doesn't have a sales software play. So together this partnership is a huge shot across the bow at his competitors Oracle and Salesforce.
Narayen, a native of India, was also honored earlier this year by Carnegie as a recipient of the Great Immigrants award.





No. 19: Tim Cook, CEO, Apple
AP
Perhaps Apple isn't the most obvious name in enterprise tech, but we'd be remiss if we didn't give a shout-out to CEO Tim Cook.
Cook has been working hard to push Apple deeper into the enterprise world. He's personally crafted partnerships with Cisco, Deloitte, IBM, and SAP. 
And he's doing this in Apple's usual, not-so-humble way. When he was a guest star at Cisco's big tech conference in June, giving an update the two-year-old partnership to make Apple devices work better on Cisco networks, Cook said:
"We thought, looking at the enterprise, people were spending tons of money. But when you looked at the user experience, it wasn't very good. So we thought we could bring Apple's legendary ease-of-use and simplicity to the enterprise and really change the way people work."
Touché. 





No. 18: Pat Gelsinger, CEO, VMware
VMware
Pat Gelsinger is powerful for his leadership of VMware, which offers software that makes servers, networks and desktop computers more efficient.
VMware has now been swallowed by Dell as part of Dell's record-breaking acquisition of VMware's previous parent company EMC. And VMware is now Dell's crown jewel.
Gelsinger had to eat a little crow in late 2016 when he announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services, after spending years trying to best AWS. 
But if you can't beat 'em, join 'em and the partnership should turn VMware into a powerful player in AWS's growing world.
 Gelsinger was also among the tech execs who have met with President Trump in recent months to discuss tech's policy concerns.





No. 17: Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and chairwoman of HP
Flickr/HP/HP Deutschland
Meg Whitman is the leader of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, one of the largest IT companies in the world, next to the consolidated Dell/EMC entity, a competitor of whom she's highly critical.
Whitman, a Republican, is also not shy about wading into politics, no matter the political climate. While she didn't back the winner of the 2016 election (she stumped for Hillary Clinton instead), she consistently speaks her mind in national debates over issues like border taxes. 
Meanwhile, she is still working on HP's turnaround. Lately she's been doing that through some high-profile acquisitions. In March, HP bought flash storage company Nimble Storage for $1 billion. In January, HP Enterprise bought SimpliVity, a storage startup, for $650 million.





No. 16: Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel
Reuters/Beck Diefenbach
Having missed the boat on smartphones and with the PC industry in decline, Intel needed to find a new place to sell its chips, and ensure it won't miss the next big wave.
To CEO Brian Krzanich, that new place is self-driving cars.
Intel, in its second-largest acquisition in its 50-year history, spent a whopping $15.3 billion to buy the self-driving-car-tech company Mobileye. 
If self-driving vehicles are the future – as Uber, Alphabet, and others believe – Intel wants to sell the bits that make them happen, and Krzanich is the one behind the wheel. 





No. 15: Mark Hurd, co-CEO, Oracle
AP
Mark Hurd shares the CEO job with Safra Catz. He's responsible for the company's operations teams and its massive, legendary sales organization. 
His teams are pushing Oracle's customers into its all-important cloud computing services as fast as they can. And he's having good success. Investors have been driving Oracle's stock to all-time highs this summer.
Internally, Hurd is leading a pet project to hire young grads and train them up to be great cloud salespeople and take on other roles within the company. That includes Oracle's expansion into the Austin area, a campus that also includes luxury housing for employees.





No. 14: Safra Catz, co-CEO, Oracle
Oracle
Safra Catz has been the company's financial genius for decades.
She's the brains behind Oracle's massive success through mergers and acquisitions. But she's also helping the company come up with the cash to build out a bunch of new data centers to house its cloud computing aspirations. 
Catz has said she won't ever be in the running to become sole CEO of Oracle and will retire from her job as right-hand woman to founder and chairman Larry Ellison if and when Ellison ever retires.
As that doesn't look like it will happen anytime soon, she's also pursuing her passion: education for kids. She spearheaded a project to build a high school, with a slate of cutting edge STEM courses, right on the campus Oracle's main Redwood City, California, headquarters.





No. 13: Michael Dell, CEO, Dell Enterprise
Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images
In 2016, Dell's blockbuster $67 billion acquisition of one-time rival EMC finally closed, in the biggest high-tech deal ever.
It makes industry stalwart Michael Dell the leader of one of the world's biggest IT companies—and one of the last big holdouts against the rise of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud-computing platforms.
Billionaire Dell has been a powerhouse in the tech world for decades but this move made him even more powerful.





No. 12: Ginni Rometty, CEO, IBM
IBM
For the entire time Ginni Rometty has been CEO of IBM, the company has been going through a slow and painful transition as its old-school businesses decline.
But she's determined to drive IBM into the future by investing in up-and-coming technologies like cloud computing, AI and blockchain.
IBM Watson is well-known for its AI technology. In 2017, Rometty has put IBM in a leadership position in the young area blockchain, which allows information about transactions to be spread across many computers in many locations. IBM and Walmart are already showcasing blockchain to track food as it ships around the country. 
Rometty was also one of the first tech execs to join the Trump administration as an advisor. While other CEOs left their advisory positions over the President's unpopular policy decisions, like leaving the Paris Agreement on climate change, Rometty has remained committed to her advisor role.

Wikipedia/Krd
Linus Torvalds is one of the world's most famous developers thanks to creating Linux, the operating system that rules everything from tiny devices to supercomputers, 26 years ago. 
As of 2017, his life's work has won so thoroughly that its one-time arch rival Microsoft now claims that Linux makes up 33% of the virtual machine running on Microsoft Azure.
And, thanks to him and a weekend's worth of work, he created a change-management tool called Git, which has since led to an entire industry of software development startups, including the $2 billion startup Github.





No. 10: Urs Hölzle, president of Google Enterprise, Google
Google+
Urs Hölzle was Google's eighth employee and is the genius who built much of Google's infrastructure and data centers across the world.
Today Hölzle is the technical wizard spearheading Google's aggressive push into cloud computing. He believes that Google's cloud revenue could one day overtake advertising revenue at the $631 billion company. 
On top of that, he's trying to make Google's part of the internet greener, vowing that Google's data centers will one day run on 100% renewable energy. 





No. 9: Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon
Flickr/Leonid Mamchenkov 
Amazon Web Services is far and away the leader in the fast-growing cloud computing market, where companies rent computing and storage, paid for by the hour and delivered as a service across the Internet.
 It's already on pace to be at least a $14 billion business for Amazon this fiscal year, and the retail giant's most profitable unit.
So much of that success is because of Amazon CTO Werner Vogels, whose team keeps adding new features while driving down costs.
And as Amazon keeps building its cloud under Vogels' direction, it just keeps the pressure on the legacy IT world and startups alike to drop prices and up their game. 





No 8: Bill McDermott, CEO, SAP
SAP
SAP remains the world's biggest enterprise app company and under Bill McDermott's leadership it is slowly but surely finding its way to cloud computing.
Revenues rose in the last quarter, up 10% thanks to the cloud computing.
McDermott's personal story has been a Horatio Alger tale full of incredible ups and downs. Born a working class kid, he bought his first business, a deli, at age 16. He joined SAP in 2002 and became CEO in 2014, the first American ever to run the giant German-based company.
In 2015, he lost one of his eyes in a freak accident. But nothing stops his can-do attitude. "I am living proof that vision is not just what you see," he recently told CNBC.





No. 7: Chuck Robbins, CEO, Cisco
Cisco Live/Business Insider
After six straight quarters of falling revenues, and yet another big annual layoff, CEO Chuck Robbins finally revealed Cisco's big save: "the Network Intuitive"— which embeds AI into networks.
This is Robbins' big bet to Cisco's networks to the new age of software-controlled, programmable hardware. He promises it will do things other networks can't, like Encrypted Traffic Analytics, which can detect malware in encrypted files without having to open the files.
Meanwhile, Robbins is also trying to shift Cisco from its hardware roots into the world of cloud software, with cloud's recurring revenues. These aspirations inspired the big surprise $3.7 billion acquisition of AppDynamics right before it was set to start trading on the public markets.
Recently, Wall Street has started to buy this turnaround vision and the stock is on the rise.





No. 6: Bill Gates, founder & technology advisor, Microsoft
Eric Vidal/Reuters
Although Bill Gates' is no longer at the helm of Microsoft, he continues to be heavily involved in the company as an advisor to CEO Satya Nadella and a thought-leader across the industry.
As the richest person in the world, with a whopping net worth of $90.4 billion, Gates can't help but be powerful.
He's also trying to push the world forward with his philanthropic investments making an impact inside and out of tech.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funds science, technology, health care, education and is trying to solve poverty, even for some of the most impoverished places on the planet.
 





No. 5: Diane Greene, SVP of Google Cloud, Google
Google
Diane Greene was a legend in the enterprise tech world as a founder of VMware, long before she joined Google to lead its cloud computing efforts.
And now that she's at the helm of Google's cloud, she wants Google to beat Amazon in this brave new world.
The Google Cloud leader has said publicly that she plans to be ahead of Amazon by 2022, and the scuttlebutt inside Google is that she's well on track to get there.
In 2017, Google has already seen a $2 billion deal with IPO sweetheart Snap, as well as giants like eBay and Disney, proving that under Greene, Google is slowly but surely becoming a force in enterprise IT.
 





No. 4: Larry Ellison, CTO & chairman, Oracle
Rich Fury/AP Images
Oracle had blow-out Q4 2017 earnings in large part thanks to Ellison's pursuit of a major new rival, Amazon Web Services, the massively profitable cloud-computing arm of the Amazon retail empire. 
Oracle saw 58% YoY growth in cloud for Q4 2017.  
While the jet-setting billionaire has formidable rivals at Microsoft and Amazon, Ellison is keeping Oracle in the game, and shareholders are responding accordingly.





No .3: Marc Benioff, CEO, Salesforce
Kimberly White/Getty
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has literally altered the landscape of San Francisco.
 Benioff's $1 billion Salesforce Tower, set to open in 2018, is the tallest and most expensive building in the city.
As cloud computing has become the hottest thing in the enterprise world, Salesforce has come into its own. It more or less owns customer-relationship management (CRM) software, which helps sales people organize their work, find leads and keep track of customers. 
Thanks to a partnership with IBM that has Watson powering Salesforce's AI product Einstein, Salesforce is now moving into the next big thing artificial intelligence. Benioff even uses his own version of AI to run the company.





No. 2: Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft

Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has found its groove again. 
Microsoft has become a formidable competitor to Amazon Web Services and become the No. 2 biggest cloud computing player. With its acquisition of LinkedIn it is also challenging Salesforce.
Although Nadella has overseen a steady stream of layoffs at the company, some of them downright enormous, his approval rating among employees is quite high.
Nadella, a long-time Microsoft veteran, has been systematically trimming the fat, making the company leaner and less bureaucratic and preparing the company for the lower-margin world of cloud computing. And so far, it's working. 





No. 1: Andrew Jassy, CEO, Amazon Web Services
Flicker/djevents
As CEO of Amazon Web Services, Andrew Jassy runs one of the most aggressive and dominating forces in the enterprise tech industry today.
AWS is setting the tone in the enterprise IT world and forcing the big established giants to jump to its tune. Companies like Cisco, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft must change their products and business models, or they'll face demise just like the one-time mighty EMC that got swallowed by Dell last year.
Since being promoted from his role as senior vice president in spring 2016, Jassy has overseen an AWS that had a 43% bump in Q1 profits year-over-year. And because AWS has been seeing so much growth since its carnation, that 43% bump was actually a slowdown.
No matter. AWS is Amazon's most profitable business unit. And with Jassy is at the helm, by all accounts, he is steering the ship in the right direction.

Reimagining the customer onboarding experience with Box, Salesforce, DocParser, Twilio, and…HomepageFollowSign in / Sign upBox DevelopersBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 18Reimagining the customer onboarding experience with Box, Salesforce, DocParser, Twilio, and StamplayThis post was written by David Majetic, an Enterprise Sales Engineer at Box.My current mission at Box is to lead up Sales Engineering for Box Canada. I am tasked to take our company vision for Cloud Content Management and inspire my prospects and customers to think differently on how they manage and access their content. In my experience, the best conversations I have had often come after showing a live demo of a use case that not only incorporate Box products, but also include other products that may be complementary or already in use in a company.With this post, I’m going to show you one of the demos that I recently put together for a customer. I pulled this together using a loan origination sample application built on Box Platform, the Box Salesforce connector, the Stamplay low-code development platform, and APIs from DocParser and Twilio. The specific demo scenario is a customer uploading a loan request to a banking website that includes uploading a document. The document is uploaded to Box using our API and App User model, and sent to a “Loan Applications” folder in Box. Upon upload, the file is sent to DocParser, a data extraction tool for PDFs, for parsing, and the derived metadata extracted by DocParser is stored back to Box as metadata on the file and also used to create a Lead Record in Salesforce. The agent is then sent a notification that a new request has been submitted, generated using the Twilio API, that they can review the lead record in Salesforce, and review associated documents using the Box for Salesforce connector. The agent reviews the loan application and if everything looks OK, they trigger a Docusign flow using the Box for Docusign integration. When the customer signs the document using Docusign, it is automatically saved back to Box and the agent is sent a notification with a URL to the signed document using the Twilio API.Most companies today run processes like loan origination off of a legacy, on-premise ECM solution. If they’ve managed to make the process self-serve, it’s by investing a lot in custom application development, using the ECM solution primarily for secure retention of content. More likely, the process is manual, with paper documents or email. Box gives you another option. Because Box is agnostic to the user interface, experiences can be designed that flow content through our first-party web and mobile apps, the applications that we integrate with (like Salesforce, Docusign, and Microsoft Office), and your custom applications that consume our APIs. This means that you can drive full end-to-end experiences, like onboarding a new customer, with unified content storage and governance through Box. Notice that we’re referring to “experiences” and not “processes.” The ultimate goal is to have on-demand access to content in any experience you are creating or any business application you are using.Supporting experiences like the onboarding process just described is possible because Box is both a SaaS application, and also available as a suite of cloud content management APIs, known as Box Platform, that can be used to embed cloud content management into your own applications. Depicted below, you can see Box as one of the SaaS providers that companies use to run their business, but also Box Platform as an API provider similar to Twilio, Stripe, or Sendgrid, with which companies can build digital experiences. In the same way that Twilio provides messaging services for your applications, Box provides content management services for your applications.What this means for our customers is that content can be seamlessly surfaced through prebuilt integrations with business applications like Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Adobe and DocuSign to name a few. In addition, when your content management system is in the cloud, it can and must be the same system that powers content experiences for custom applications for customers and employees if we are to deliver on the promise of digital.I thought of a quick way to demonstrate the value of our Functional PaaS and SaaS offerings in action. One of the benefits of cloud is that it allows you to prototype solutions faster, fail faster, and — most importantly — deliver faster. Everything I built here can be done for free by signing up for developer accounts. My whole thought process was to not build an end-to-end solution, but to show how you can connect some best-of-breed technologies to create building blocks my customers could then incorporate and take to the next level. I used what could be considered part of a mortgage application process, but it really could be anything involving documents, notifications, and customer records.I was able to do this fairly quickly using Stamplay, which is a low code platform that easily allows you to run workflow logic across PaaS and SaaS solutions. This is a growing area of interest for Box as more content plays are requiring on demand services. Other solutions in the mix:Salesforce Integration with Box — Pre-built with Box SaaS solutionDocuSign — pre-built with Box’s SaaS applicationAdobe — a pre-built integration with Box EditTwilio — Stamplay connector for SMS messagingDocParser — Stamplay connector for PDF document parsing/OCRCustom Web App — Using the Box App User authentication modelApp Users are full-featured enterprise Box accounts that belong to your application, not a Box end-user. Unlike typical Box accounts, these accounts do not have an associated login and can only be accessed through the Content API by the controlling application and associated Box User ID. This new user model allows your application to take advantage of groups, permissions, collaborations, comments, tasks, and the many other features offered by the Box platform to create white-labeled content experiences. Your custom applications have users that are now part of a content management process. A content security/identity model for users in any application gives you an audit trail for compliance, alleviates building one on your own (trust us — it’s hard) and allows your content to be ported to other applications as opposed to using a repository for dumb storage and all the content security/audit (if you’ve done it right) live somewhere else.Here is the high level description of what happens.Customer Uploads Completed PDF Form through custom web appCustomer. Info Extracted from FormNew Salesforce CRM Lead created and filled with Extracted Customer. InfoBox Folder automatically associated with CRM lead with all the Box Web App featuresAgent sends doc from Salesforce to Customer for SignatureCustomer Receives Doc on Mobile and Signs DigitallyAgent Receives Text indicating Doc has been SignedAgent Previews Signed Doc on MobileYou can check out a video demo of the application here: https://cloud.box.com/s/15687j8r5prm2km8x8wv61717gdyiapbThanks to pre-existing integrations, this demo was really just implementing IF THEN ELSE logic and following unique identifiers between systems. A business analyst with little to no programming skills could do it.So why does this matter?Connect More. Build LessUse references to content. Don’t move it.Use best-of-breed technology.Deliver and respond faster.Here are the two high level Stamplay Flow recipes:They key to this Flow was create the necessary fields on the lead Salesforce object record from the DocParser variables and create a FRUP table record in Salesforce. The FRUP table is basically an intersection table that tells our integration package which Box folder our embed technology should point for a given Salesforce record.This opens up endless possibilities for Box content to follow the Salesforce record. Use cases could include sales, claims, work orders, case management and digital vaults in portal oriented applications. The ability to have instant access to the same repository another user be it employee or customer is experiencing in another application is transformational.For a closer look at the Stamplay Flows, I have created step-by-step screenshots on how built them. They were purpose-built for my demo, but with some modifications it could support a production environment.Stamplay Flows:eMortgage Flow: https://cloud.box.com/s/cqws9wqojsn0qgpasd5tw7e4skrh6tqzForm Parsed Flow: https://cloud.box.com/s/myn3ofaye0c2j2sdhgg6snjmbduc6prjI recommend reviewing the Stamplay blog on how to create a Stamplay blueprint for DocParser and Box.To build this demo for yourself, you can sign up for a Twilio trial account, sign up for a Salesforce Developer account, and either use your existing Box account or sign up for a free Box Developer account.Once your content resides in Box, the ability to use our Cloud Content Management Platform, ecosystem of business application integrations, open APIs and the explosion of complementary micro services the promise of digital transformation may be closer than you think. And the good news is, it doesn’t take a whole lot of work to start building!Share5Never miss a story from Box Developer Blog, when you sign up for Medium.

Seventy-one percent of companies say closing more deals is their number one priority for sales, according to Hubspot's State of Inbound Report. Yet many organizations are still following outdated sales processes.
It's time to step into the future and embrace sales automation.
Sales automation streamlines your sales process and ensures your team is focused on the right opportunities and isn't wasting time on routine or tedious tasks. The more you can use technology to automate your sales process, the more time your team will spend actually making sales.
In an interview with Martech Advisor, Tiffani Bova, global customer growth and innovation evangelist at Salesforce, said, "The collision of speed, technology and customer experience is challenging sales organizations of all sizes to do a hard reset on what they have done in the past to improve sales performance."
Doing what you've always done won't get you the results you want moving forward. You need to adapt your processes to changing mindsets and practices. Here's where you should focus your automation efforts within your sales process:
1. Outreach
Whether you're calling, emailing or visiting in person, keeping in communication with your clients and prospects eats up a lot of your time, leaving room for little else. But following up on a lead is one of the most important tasks for a sales rep.
In fact, 80% of sales require at least five phone calls after meeting for the first time, according to The Marketing Donut. But remembering and trying to fit in those five phone calls can be a real challenge when you're trying to balance a number of clients.
On her blog, motivational speaker Patricia Fripp writes, "It is not your client's job to remember you; it is your obligation and responsibility to make sure you are unforgettable."
To streamline your client communication, invest in a system that will manage it for you. Look for a customer relationship management or CRM system that allows you to make phone calls and send emails directly in the system. This way, you won't have to log your communication; the system will do it for you, and you'll have a complete record of your communication with each client to reference in the future.
2. Lead prioritization
You know you need to stay on top of all of your contacts, but with so many to manage, it can be overwhelming. But by automating your lead prioritization, you won't have to worry about making sure you follow up on all leads.
Your system should choose the leads to contact for you. Through a lead scoring system, you can set rules that will prioritize the most important leads. The lead scoring program will analyze all of your leads and their engagement and rank them based on their likelihood to convert.
When you go to contact a lead, you'll also get a clear picture of their history with your company and past communication, which will allow you to better communicate with them.
"You can see from prospect tracking what stage a prospect is within the funnel, and from that you can determine what vernacular and language you should use as you talk about your product," said Phil Simpson, regional vice president of sales at Salesforce in an interview with Salesforce's Pardot team. "And you can pre-empt any roadblocks or rejections by seeing how they interact with your web properties."
3. Lead distribution
When a lead comes in, it can sometimes take awhile before the sales manager sees it and assigns it to a sales rep. By the time the rep follows up on that lead, it could be too late.
Skip the middleman and let your CRM system rotate leads instead of your manager. That way, the manager can spend more time coaching reps and helping to close deals.
According to Gartner, companies that automate lead management see a 10% or greater increase in revenue in just six to nine months. By automating your lead distribution, you're not only saving time - you're also earning more money.
Leads shouldn't be distributed at random. Instead, set up criteria that make sense for your organization, such as assigning each rep to a specific territory or region.
4. Reporting
Research from Hubspot finds 40% of sales reps still use informal means such as Microsoft Excel or Outlook to store their lead and customer data, and 32% are spending an hour or more on data entry each and every day.
Reporting is crucial to your ongoing success and continued improvement. But if you're spending too much time generating reports and not enough time making sales, your priorities need to be rearranged.
Your CRM system can set up automated reports for you. You can even schedule them to be sent to your email every day. That way, you'll have a daily reminder of your progress and it'll be simple to show leadership how you're doing when they inquire.
5. Final steps
Once you've made a deal, it's time to tie up any loose ends, including contracts and payments. Make these processes simple by using automated software such as Docusign and PayPal. Instead of having to chase down the customer's signature or dealing with checks and invoices, your systems will handle it all.
When looking for a CRM system, look for one that can integrate with other forms of technology you're using. But above all, make sure the system suits your needs, the needs of your sales team and the needs of your business.
In an interview with MarTech Series, Marketo CEO Steve Lucas said, "My advice would be to ensure the platform that you choose can scale to meet the demands of your organization, is open to fit into your current and future technology systems and enables your teams to engage uniquely and authentically with every person."

“To be clear; I am a believer in decentralization. Having built systems with that I can tell you it is not the magic dust you are looking for.” — Amazon Web Services Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels. 
As we gear up to release our next e-book on the Kubernetes open source container orchestration engine (check with us in about a month), we have been reviewing how well K8s has been making its way into the enterprise — the true determinant of whether the software becomes an essential component of “the new stack,” so to speak.
Reviewing our notes from Kubecon 2017, held earlier this year in Berlin, we found some powerful testimonies from both Salesforce and Comcast. Salesforce is using it in a pilot program to power three cloud-native services, with plans to be running 20 services by the end of the year. When the company’s engineers were considering different orchestration options, they immediately appreciated the smarts behind the Kubernetes. After all, many had come from other jobs managing large at-scale workloads. “We were, frankly, blown away. The development velocity was incredible, even back then,” Salesforce Principal Architect Steve Sandke said of the developers behind Kubernetes. “These people clearly knew what they were doing.”
Comcast has found that not only does Kubernetes easily scale applications, but even helps scale IT operations teams. Its use of Kubernetes is all about “decoupling the operations of [engineering] teams at an organization, and giving them a platform to manage their own large, complicated distributed systems as easily as I can manage my Linux box,” Comcast’s Richard Fliam said. Not only would this approach cut deployment time for apps, it also cuts the amount of time staff has to spend in documentation and the communication required across groups.
Elsewhere we found that — surprise! — even Microsoft is using Kubernetes, which it needed to quickly road-test the then upcoming release of a version of SQL Server 2017 that was ported to Linux . Originally, it would take Microsoft an entire night to run 700-800 tests of the containerized SQL Server. With Kubernetes, however, the time needed to complete those tests shrank to a few hours.
This Week in Numbers: Java vs. JavaScript
A weekly chart and commentary from TNS research analyst Lawrence Hecht:

With Node.js’s use on the server-side, comparing JavaScript and Java is no longer apples vs oranges. With that context, it is noteworthy that last year the number of npm (JavaScript) packages downloaded surpassed components in the maven (Java) components — ahead of Mikeal Rogers’ forecast. According to Sonatype’s 2017 State of the Software Supply Chain, 59 billion npm packages were downloaded in 2017, up 262 percent from the year before, while Java component downloads “only” rose 68 percent. The number of downloads is a function of the number of users, the total number of available to be downloaded, and frequency of software releases/updates. According to the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, the percentage of developers using Node.js has risen from 8 percent in 2013 to 26 percent in 2017.
According to Module Counts, the total number of unique Node.js modules surpassed Java in 2014 and now outpaces 3 million to 2 million. Node.js continues to grow its user base and complexity, but the continued increase in downloads per year is also related to the shortening application release cycles. Looking to the future, npm downloads per user per month will be an interesting stat to monitor.
This Week in Podcasts
The problem with the old school vendors of enterprise backup-and-recovery, aka “disaster recovery” aka “continuity of operations” is that they got the backup part OK, but the recovery process, many organizations have found, has been very difficult if not outright impossible, explained Rubrik‘s Kenny To. As explained to  Software Engineering Daily host Jeff Meyerson, Rubrik is focused on that sweet spot of Microsoft shops running a VMware infrastructure, offering an appliance (!) to back up virtual machines so they can be quickly restored. The restorations happen quickly so even if they don’t provide full performance, an organization will have something running into full operations are restored, To argued:

http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/Rubrik.mp3
 
How much is the Kubernetes community truly dependent on Google? This was the question pondered by the Software Defined Talk crew, discussing Matt Asay’s recent essay on how Kubernetes community is dependent on Google, They all agreed that Asay, while a smart fellow, seems to be misguided here. Or he was intentionally out to write a hit piece. Sure Google still dominates the K8s code development, but not as much as it used to. “Clearly, someone needs to write the annual ‘open source is boring article, let’s stop talking about it,'” Co-host Michael Coté:
http://aphid.fireside.fm/d/1437767933/9b74150b-3553-49dc-8332-f89bbbba9f92/9a22c1e8-e5eb-437c-8351-edca8bd72230.mp3
 
How does open source change in the cloud? This week in the New Stack Makers, we spoke with Apache Software Foundation co-founder Jim Jagielski about the Free Software Foundation’s Affero GPL, a version of the GPL that specifically covers cloud use of free software.

                Sales lead generation: a fact of business life 
            




Whether you’re a multinational enterprise, a two-person start-up, or anything in between, sales leads are critical to your success. Techniques for sales lead generation range from trolling social networking sites to tapping into other kinds of online and offline sources, to old-fashioned cold calling of names pulled from phone books.

Performing business lead generation in any of these ways consumes time that reps would rather spend talking to qualified customers and closing deals. Worse still, these manual sales lead generation techniques often yield less than useful results, in the form of incorrect phone numbers and partial or outdated data. This type of faulty information leads to more wasted effort and expense pursuing “dead dials” and abandoned email addresses.

	I'm surrounded by people who have helped me grow tremendously as an engineer and as a person. I'm consistently humbled by how intelligent, approachable and focused everyone is. Working in this environment gives me confidence in my ability to solve problems in thoughtful ways because everyone's opinion is treated with equal respect. We work hard, but we have a lot of fun at the same time. When I'm not coding, you'll find me measuring flour at my desk to use in my team's bread machine.

I work with amazing people writing software that solves tricky infrastructure challenges. We have a culture that encourages engineers to explore the problem space and find the best solution for it. At cloud scale, it’s not uncommon that the best solution is the one we create ourselves to push the limits of hardware, software, infrastructure, and everything in between! I also love that we’re a big company, but still feel small. You still have connections to people and have a sense of belonging, or what we like to call, our Ohana.

Being a product designer at Salesforce has given me the opportunity to create systems that solve complex problems so that our users don’t have to. That’s something that excites me. I enjoy working with my colleagues in UX to create beautiful, functional and accessible design that a large audience can use. As a designer, I look to create a visual-syntax that creates an unspoken connection with our audience. Salesforce has helped me on that journey.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]
Acquisitions[edit]
The following is a list of acquisitions by salesforce.com:


Sendia (April 2006) – now Salesforce Classic
Kieden (August 2006) – now Salesforce for Google AdWords
Kenlet (January 2007) – original product CrispyNews used at Salesforce IdeaExchange and Dell IdeaStorm – now relaunched as Salesforce Ideas

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS).[4] Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani.[5] Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software, which launched to its first customers in the fall of 1999.[6]
In June 2004 the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[7] Early investors include Magdalena Yesil, Larry Ellison, Halsey Minor, Stewart Henderson, Mark Iscaro, and Igor Sill of Geneva Venture Partners, as well as Nancy Pelosi.
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[8]
Services[edit]
Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud,[9] Service Cloud,[10] Data Cloud[11] (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud[12] (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud,[13] App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.[14]
Salesforce[edit]
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce1 Platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[15]
Force.com[edit]
Force.com is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create multitenant (single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants) add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[16] Force.com applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[17]
Force.com applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com) and Visualforce (an XML[18] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform receives three complete releases a year. As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces - Lightning Components - was introduced in beta.[19] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[20] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[21]
According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[22] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[23]
Work.com[edit]
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[24] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.
Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[25] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[26]
In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[27]
In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[28] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[29]
In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[30]
Data.com[edit]
Data.com, previously known as Jigsaw, is a cloud-based automated system for acquiring and managing CRM records within a user's Salesforce.com account.[31]
Data.com is also an online business directory of companies and business professionals that is built, maintained and accessed by a worldwide community of over a million subscribers.[32] A large database allows members to exchange and share the business information of more than 29 million contacts from over 4 million companies. This information consists of what is commonly found on a business card.
Data.com utilizes a user-generated database that's continually updated by its members. Data.com's contacts act as a virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for individual contacts.
Desk.com[edit]
Desk.com is a saas help desk and customer support product accessible through the cloud. Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.
After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011 [33] Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012 [34] as a "slick social customer support software". [35]
Desk.com is a Saas customer service application. The product differentiates itself from Salesforce's other service platform in that Desk.com specifically targets small businesses with its features and functions. [36] Desk.com integrates with a variety of products and third-party applications including Salesforce CRM, Salesforce IQ,[37] Atlassian JIRA, Mailchimp [38] and other apps. Desk.com also supports up to 50 languages. [39]
Do.com[edit]
Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2014.[40][41][42] Salesforce did not offer any reason for shutting down the service, however it provided an Export tool to save data entered within the Do.com interface. The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.[43]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform. Applications are available for free, as well as yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with Sharepoint to mobile approval management.[44] As of February 2015, it features 2,658 applications which have driven a total of over 2.8 million installs.[45] The "AppExchange" is also a place customers can search for cloud consulting partners to help them implement the technology in their own organisation. Cloud consulting partners for Salesforce include large companies like IBM's "Bluewolf" and Accenture as well as smaller ones like Cloudreach.[46]
Configuration[edit]
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.[47]
Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.
Web services[edit]
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a SOAP/REST Web service API that enables integration with other systems.
Technologies[edit]

Apex[edit]
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce pages.
Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations[48] to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer running and more complex Apex code.[49]
Visualforce[edit]
Visualforce is the view control technology on the Force.com
Lightning[edit]
In 2014, Salesforce made public the frontend of its platform, called Lightning.[50] This component based framework is what the Salesforce1 mobile app is built on and customers are now able to build on it as well. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,[51] an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.
One of the new tools released is known as the Salesforce Lightning App Builder for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.
Operations[edit]




A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management


Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major offices are in Toronto, Chicago, New York City, London, Sydney, Dublin, Hyderabad, San Mateo, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.[52] Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[53] different languages and as of July 31, 2011, had 104,000[54] customers and over 2.1 million subscribers.[55] Salesforce will be moving its Midwest Regional headquarters to Indianapolis in 2017.
Standard & Poor's included Salesforce.com, at the same time as Fastenal, into the S&P 500 index in September 2008, following the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their removal from the index.[56]
Venture capital fund[edit]
The company announced in September 2014 that it had set up a venture capital arm to fund start-ups creating apps primarily for mobile phones.[57]
IT infrastructure[edit]
Salesforce.com migrated to Dell servers with AMD processors running Linux from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris in 2008.[58] The company uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to allow its customers to send large amounts of email.[59]
In 2012, Salesforce.com announced plans to build a data center in the UK to handle European citizens' personal data.[60]
In 2013, Salesforce.com and Oracle announced a nine-year partnership in which Salesforce.com will use Oracle Linux, Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database, and the Java platform to power salesforce.com's applications and SaaS platform.[61]
Criticisms[edit]





This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2017)


In November 2007, a successful phishing attack on a salesforce.com employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.[62][63][64] The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam.[65]
While the crowd-sourced method of building business contacts[66] has proven popular with recruiters, marketers and sales professionals, it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the site's database is entered without permission from the person being listed. Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.[67] However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address have been noted.[68]

Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
