Stock Market Observations

			July 08, 2017							 BY 															Doug Ramsey

While the S&P 500 remains below our 2,550-2,600 summer target zone, we can’t help but be impressed by the quality of its recent highs—including confirmations by all of the “Red Flag” bellwethers except the S&P 500 Financials (which barely missed a new high on July 7th).

What Does The Low Vol Divergence Mean?

			July 08, 2017							 BY 															Doug Ramsey

Low Volatility stocks have been the darlings of this bull market, and Low Vol is now considered a long-term “alpha generator” alongside such Hall of Fame quant factors as Low P/E and Price Momentum.

Recent Years’ Oil Price Experience Akin To 1980s’

			July 08, 2017							 BY 															Jun Zhu

We revisit commentary we published in 2015 regarding the late-2014 oil price crash and review why, at that time, we believed oil prices could stay at depressed levels for a longer period than most expected. Additionally, we advise avoiding two Energy sector segments: companies with high balance-sheet risk, and Energy Royalty Trusts.

Bond Conundrum—This Time Is Not That Different

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Chun Wang

Despite the late reversal in rates and the yield curve, the flattening trend of the yield curve remains intact. The fact that longer-term bond yields have fallen while the Fed is raising rates brings back memories of the “bond conundrum” episode during 2004-2006.

Humble Oil

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Scott Opsal

With Energy stocks underperforming the S&P 500 by 20% YTD, contrarian clients are wondering if the sector holds any promise. Here we look for valuation signals that offer encouragement for bargain-hunting investors willing to buy on weakness.

Inflation Watch


Inflation Disappoints Again

			June 15, 2017							 BY 															Chun Wang

The CPI numbers have disappointed three months in a row. Weak commodity prices do not inspire higher inflation expectations. The global scope of inflation deceleration adds more weight to the recent soft readings. However, lower bond yields relative to nominal growth rate is inflationary and buffers the impact of weak inflation and rate hikes.

Stock Market Observations

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Doug Ramsey

After a two-month lull, stock market momentum reasserted itself in May bringing our summer S&P 500 target of 2,600 back into focus… Meanwhile, we’ve fielded several media calls about the “FANG” stocks’ large contribution to some YTD returns—but that doesn’t diminish the new highs being made elsewhere by disparate groups… NYSE Weekly A/D Line and New Highs/Lows figures also suggest the stock market isn’t yet top-heavy enough to tip over.

Dynamic Factor Investing: A Study In Value

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Scott Opsal

Investment factors experience performance cycles just like every other asset and index. The Value factor is robust across definitions, as all eight versions produced positive excess returns under long/short and long-only methodologies.

A Contrarian “Late-Cycle” Play? 

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Doug Ramsey

The Amazon Effect masks both the underperformance of the average Discretionary stock and the relative value that’s been reestablished across the sector. “Discretionary ex-Amazon” is a better contrarian pick than Energy.

Goldilocks—Enjoy It While It Lasts

YTD Fund Inflow Remains Highest Since 2013

Excluding money market, all equity and bond fund categories have captured cumulative net cash inflow that is more than five times the level seen at this time last year. ETF inflow this year has accounted for nearly 80% of all flows.

Inflation Subpar Again

			May 12, 2017							 BY 															Chun Wang

The latest CPI numbers are slightly weaker than expected. We think expectations for higher inflation are still on the high side. The global scope of inflation deceleration adds more weight to the recent soft readings. Patience is the right approach for the reflation trade at this point.

Earnings Momentum

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

The final Up/Down Ratio of Q1 shows a reading of 1.47. This is the highest figure we’ve seen in the past two years but it remains stubbornly below the long-term average of 1.50.

Small And Large Are Even-Steven

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

 The Small Cap P/E premium has been whittled away YTD, from 8% down to zero, as both tiers now sport a trailing P/E of 21.7x.

continue reading




Market Internals


Value Has A Moment In The Sun

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

Value led in all market cap segments during June, but for Q2 overall, Value was left in the dust. Continued momentum extended Growths’ YTD leads—especially in Small Caps.

S&P 500: That Makes Seven In A Row

			July 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a down quarter since the summer of 2015. Since then, a series of seven gradual quarterly gains have produced a 26% gain. As Big Tech had a rare misstep in June, large banks carried the load for another small monthly gain in the index.

Market Internals


Earnings Momentum

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

The two-month Up/Down Ratio for Q1 results shows a reading of 1.48. Like the quarter before, an excellent “one-month” figure has been dragged down by a second month’s results.

Market Internals


Small Cap vs Mid Cap vs Large Cap

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

As the numerator of our numerator shrank, the Ratio of Ratios made its way into “Small Cap Discount” territory for the first time in seven months.

continue reading




Market Internals


Growth vs Value vs Cyclicals

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

Value’s 2016 outperformance gap has been erased in the Large Cap space; Small Cap Value stocks slipped back into negative territory for YTD 2017.

continue reading




Market Internals


Additional Factors

			June 07, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

So much for that 2,400 resistance level. The S&P 500 plowed through its March 1st high as we closed out May and started June. Valuations, terrorist attacks, and a cloudier political climate are continually being shrugged off.

continue reading




Market Internals


Earnings Momentum

			May 05, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

We start 2017 with a robust reading of 1.91. With the painful memory of last quarter’s fast start and terrible finish still fresh in mind, we won’t be celebrating prematurely.

continue reading




Market Internals

Small Cap vs Mid Cap vs Large Cap

			May 05, 2017							 BY 															Phil Segner

We can say, with confidence, that although the relative P/E relationship sits at its long-term average (3% Small Cap premium), the absolute P/E ratios of both tiers are terribly high.

Director of Research

 
Scott is Director of Research for The Leuthold Group, LLC. His responsibilities include conducting in-depth research projects and exploring fundamental and quantitative studies that support the firm’s portfolio and strategy recommendations. He also coordinates idea flow among the firm’s research team, sits on the firm’s asset allocation and investment strategy committees and is a regular contributor to The Leuthold Group’s institutional research publications.
Scott brings over thirty years of professional investment experience to the Leuthold team. As Chief Investment Officer of Invista Capital Management, and as Head of Equities at Members Capital Advisors, he was involved in all aspects of firm management; establishing policies on risk management, asset allocation, quantitative techniques, style-based investing, and taxable investing. He designed and implemented institutional-grade research and portfolio management processes to provide a rigorous, consistent framework for decision making and the analytical tools that drive strategy for multi-asset portfolios. 
Scott’s past corporate-level activities included serving on management and investment policy committees, staff recruiting and hiring, representing the equity group at fund board meetings, marketing and support to wholesalers and financial representatives, and selecting outside sub-advisors.
In his experience as a portfolio manager, Scott introduced new tools including factor analysis, valuation models, quantitative ranking and comparison tools, target price and position weighting analysis, risk management, and performance attribution. He established relationships with top pension consulting firms and competed in institutional finals searches, bringing in new third party assets from a national base. Scott’s portfolio management assignments included international equity, domestic equity, taxable investing and convertible securities. He was twice named as one of Barron’s Top 100 Mutual Fund Managers. 
Just prior to joining the Leuthold team, Scott fulfilled a lifelong career goal by serving as Director of the Applied Investments Program and teaching Security Analysis and other finance classes at the University of Wisconsin ̶ Whitewater.
Scott received his B.S.B.A. from Drake University in 1982 and an MBA from the University of Minnesota in 1983. He earned his CFA designation in 1986 and recently served on the CFA Society Madison Board of Directors.
