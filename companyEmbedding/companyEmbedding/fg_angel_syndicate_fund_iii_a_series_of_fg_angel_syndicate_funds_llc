The 99 Investor Problem


When the JOBS Act was finalized, one of the rule changes that had a lot of fanfare around it was the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have. Prior to the JOBS Act, it was 500, after which point the company had to register and report to the SEC just like it was a public company (even if it hadn’t gone public.) This was a major issue for many fast growing companies that either went through strange contortions not to have 500 investors, or filed with the SEC to get no-action letters. There were plenty of nuances around this rule and I was in the middle of several situations that structured around it legally. Each time it was a lot of overhead for the company in question, none of which added anything to the system except fees to the lawyers.
Lifting the number of investors to 2000 seemed to make sense. In the situations I was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem. So that’s good.
But ever since we started working with AngelList on FG Angels, we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the 99 Investor Problem. We structure our investment in companies via an LLC that has all the individual FG Angels syndicate members in it. This simplifies life for the company as they only end up with 1 investor – the FG Angels syndicate LCC – rather than a bunch of individual investors. At this point we have 217 backers in our syndicate, so with us each company would end up having 218 separate investors if we didn’t use the LLC.
If everyone was on the cap table, the company would have to chase down 218 signatures for everything. Instead, using our approach, they have effectively two investors – our FG Angels syndicate (one investor) and Foundry Group (another investor). Two signatures. Much easier. We handle the Foundry Group signature. AngelList handles the syndicate signature.
Except it doesn’t work that way. The SEC limits an LLC to having 99 investors. So we can only have 99 of the 217 syndicate members participate. Now, there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” (QPs) – individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets – from the 99 investor count. Overall our QPs + the top 99 investors in our syndicate represent $321,000 based on committed amounts to FG Angels. If you include the balance of the 237 members, we end up at a syndicate of $439,000. The company then gets our commitment of $50,000 on top of that.
As a result of this 99 investor limitation, we have two disappointing problems. First, we have over 100 investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the 99 investor rule. Next, there is $118,000 per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get. Bad for the companies and bad for the investor.
We’ve spent lots of time over the past 60 days trying to solve the 99 investor problem. At this point, we’ve run into a dead end. We’ve tried multiple LLCs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity. We’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work. We’re certainly open to ideas at this point.
In the mean time, until we solve this, AngelList is making the following changes to their Syndicates product.
– Qualified Purchasers: AngelList will include all Qualified Purchasers (individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets) in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the SEC’s 99-investor limit. We will soon email your backers to determine if they are Qualified Purchasers (QPs) and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the QPs.
– Top 99 Backers: The next time you syndicate a deal, we will include all QPs and the top 99 non-QPs by commitment amount. You can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top 99. The top 99 backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts.
– Funds: We are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top 99 backers or QPs to participate in your syndicated deals.
– Notifying Backers: Finally, we will notify your backers of the SEC’s 99-investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts.
We are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the FG Angels activity. The 99 investor rule directly undermines this, and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in. It’s another example of the challenges of the JOBS Act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation.










Sean Killeen



[disclaimer: I know next to nothing about these aspects of business, and am purely spitballing, so apologies if this is unworkable] A thought: instead of splitting up the investors into groups, could you split up what they’re investing in into groups? If you have ~300 investors, could you create three entities for them to invest in that are all controlled by the syndicate, which would allow 99 per? Trying to turn the problem on its head to see if it makes more sense to shuffle things around on the flip side.






jasonmendelson



the SEC is too smart for that and will consider them as one entity.  Sigh…..








David Brooks



Very interesting. I would assume this will lead to a small number of very large syndicates. Hopefully AngelList creates enough transparency among smaller investors so that they know where they stack up in a syndicate, and have flexibility to move to others with less backing. But will investors do that, or is the idea of a superstar lead too compelling?






jasonmendelson



Trying to post again…. I agree with your take.  Large syndicates will need to have higher investing followers.  No idea what investors will do, but it’s a serious bummer that we can’t truly have crowdfunding here.








JLM



.
Potential solution:
Investors form GP or LP with unlimited number of investors and with conditions determined by investors en masse.   This effectively mirrors the AngelList syndicate rules.  You are effectively moving the AngelList rules upstream.
GP or LP forms LLC with a single managing member and the GP or LP as other member.
LLC — with single managing member and GP or LP member — joins AngelList as investment vehicle.
New LLC makes investments and complies with all SEC/JOBS Act and AngelList rules.
Variation on theme:  Each investment uses a mirror image but “one off” LLC in order not to commingle different investments.  This would also be a bit of legal insurance against spill over legal liability.

Millie Tadewaldt



Good ideas. The issue here is that the SEC is too smart for that 🙂 and it “looks through” all investment vehicles that are formed specifically for the purpose of buying the same portfolio company, counting all of the individual investors in those special purpose vehicles against the investor limit. 
It is possible for form a more “fund-like” investment vehicle that deploys capital across multiple deals without triggering the look-through.








DaveJ



Have you looked into setting it up as a mutual fund?






jasonmendelson



We haven’t because as mutual fund managers, we’d be liable to all of the syndicate members if we chose bad investors.  Our investors in the our main venture funds would not allow this and we are generally scared of lawyers.  (Which is why I stopped looking in mirrors long ago).






Joe Wallin



DaveJ–cost of being a mutual fund is prohibitive. So, it is not a practical solution.








Brett Topche



It’s an issue for small traditional funds as well. Depending on which SEC exemption you use to raise your fund, you are typically limited to 99 LPs. Not an issue for larger funds with fewer, larger institutional commitments, but for smaller funds raised primarily from high net worth individuals, it can be a pain in the ass. Also, from the company standpoint, if the LLC is formed solely for the purpose of investing in that company (i.e. your syndicate forms a new LLC for each investment, which seems likely given that the syndicate changes over time), all of the investors in the LLC count towards their 2,000 limit. Not necessarily a huge deal for one syndicate investing in a company, but if you have a couple of syndicates involved, even though you only have to chase down one signature, you can start eating into your 2,000.






jasonmendelson



Agreed.








tubby_bartles



This issue is more difficult than other AngelList issues. Elsewhere, AngelList is meeting the spirit of the law, but needed to find a clever way to meet the letter of the law as well given the new technologies.
In this case, the spirit of the 99 investor rule is to prevent large number of investors from acting as a coordinated group without “being public”. So the SEC has had many, many years to plug every possible letter-of-the-law loophole.
The specific legal language doesn’t refer to funds – it refers to “organized groups” and the SEC considers that to mean they look through any legal structure you pick to see whether the group is organized as a single group or not.
Splitting investments (into parallel funds or by groups of “upstream” funds as suggested in the comments here) is already said by the SEC to count all investors. 
I suspect this one may need a law change to address.






jasonmendelson



I agree.  The integration issues that SEC makes part of  the issue kills us.  Perhaps a no-action letter is due?






Sean Schantzen



Have you found a way that a no action letter could help with this? The limit comes from the Investment Company Act and is in the statute itself (which I don’t think a no action letter could change). I don’t know anyway around it without running into integration issues (maybe a creative no action letter that addresses just integration, since integration isn’t in the statute, but the SEC would really have to be on board with syndicates). We’ve been trying to find a work around for this too, but came to the same conclusions. If someone goes down the no action letter road, we’d be happy to be involved and help out.






jasonmendelson



I haven’t found a way, it’s just a theory.  If the SEC won’t bust us, we are clean but this is a very broad topic that a no action letter might not work for.






Sean Schantzen



Thanks. The whole 99 investor limit seems like a relic just like the 500 investor reporting limit. It would be great to at least increase it by the same 4x the 500 investor limit was, regardless of whether by no action letter or statute change.






jasonmendelson



agreed














DL



JLM outlined the direction SproutrHouse is looking for a solution. Brad, where has this path led you?
Since Angel List began offering Syndicates, I have been working to solve a variation of this problem to serve early-stage companies privately at SproutrHouse. SproutrHouse offers natural CPG brands a simple crowd funding solution but it’s a $125-$400k investment that the market is seeking and one SproutrHouse is well-suited to address.






jasonmendelson



We’ve actually only been led to the ideas that Brad describes above.  I have a feeling we are headed toward a request for a SEC no-action letter, but the issue might be too broad and need legislative action.








Carlos



Does a Series LLC work?  Not available in Cali, but who wants to do business there anyway 😉 #stackexchange.  I am exploring using a series LLC in a novel way to promote investment into a core technology, where each individual “app” of this core technology could be its own company.  Separates investors, liability, minimizes paperwork, and above all fees right?  Would this be something you guys would entertain in funding in my case? Hoping that this could be useful in this case as well.  This afterall was given birth via the mutual fund industry, per wikipedia:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_LLC






jasonmendelson



Well, unfortunately we need to be able to do business in CA, so no.  And if you make the company split up like that you get pass through taxes to the investors which doesn’t work, either.  Thanks for the idea!








JMN



If section 3(c)(1) is not amended, the 100 investor
limit could severally undermine the JOBS Act’s on several levels. The accredited
investor verification requirements, as defined by the JOBS Act, should be
sufficient foundation to argue a 2,000 investor cap – in line with the max. number
of AI’s a private company can introduce as shareholders. A no-action letter may
work if the SEC’s fully aware its efforts surrounding the JOBS Act could be
vein.






bfeld



Yup. It feels like one possible solution is a no-action letter, but this ultimately is a one-off per organization (e.g. AngelList) so it doesn’t really solve the overall problem.






JMN



Although a one-off result, the outcome would set a precedent assisting other organizations, startups, small investors. The other option is a collective effort to force an amendment to section 3(c)(1). If common sense prevailed, the upside benefits far outweigh the downside risk if the investor cap was increased in line with allowable shareholders (letting companies decide the weighting) subject to AI’s being certified pursuant to Title II.










riverland



could this be relevant or helpful? https://verifyinvestor.com/






bfeld



Sort of. AngelList is doing this for free however – see https://www.feld.com/archives/2014/01/angellist-accreditation-report.html






Jor Law



Hi, Co-founder of VerifyInvestor.com and AngelList fan here.  What we do is similar to what AngelList provides, but they have a limited use case while ours is a more reliable and comprehensive solution.  Their solution is great for their platform, I think, but ours is something that can be relied upon by companies, their advisors/professionals and investors who need certainty of compliance.






Jor Law



Somehow my other post got removed, but I did want to add that https://verifyinvestor.com doesn’t currently address the Investment Company Act and 100 invest limit issue.  It’s more a solution relating to general solicitation and 506(c).










ObjectMethodology.com



Sounds like we need an “OWNERSHIP Act”? Something that let’s people in the US (a country based on freedom) be free to do as they please.






Scott



Welcome to my world, Brad.  The Company Act and the investor slot issues are a real pain in the ass.  As you’ve discovered, if you structure your vehicles as 3(c)7 vehicles by including only QPs, you’ll be ok.  It’s actually pretty easy.  If you must accommodate accredited investors, look into Registered Investment Company (“RIC”) structures.  A closed end RIC (essentially a ’40 Act, closed-end mutual fund structure) allows you to aggregate accredited investor capital in a private vehicle.  It’s not a free lunch – you’ll need to be registered, have an independent board, have third-party admin, etc.  On the plus side, its fairly permanent capital (liquidity with gating), is flexible, and offers the ability to reinvest proceeds or dividend out proceeds, and is well traveled ground.  You should look into it.  There is a cost, but if the money you’re aggregating is big enough, it could make sense.






bfeld



Yup – we know this well – and have no interest in going down this path. That’s not – in our mind – the goals of the JOBS Act, nor is it how we approach our world in general, which is why (a) we’ve never done this sort of thing in the past and (b) we are intrigued and excited about the ground AngelList is plowing.








Felix Dashevsky



This issue arises because you are (double-) pooling investors.  Given the electronic/easy nature of AngelList closing process, I question the need for a separate syndicate LLC.  Let the investors invest directly into Startups. And play with Startup funding docs to ensure streamlined future interaction with investors (or use power of attorney, advisory contract, or solve it technologically).   
The issue such direct structure would highlight is your (and AngelList’s) fee.  However, I think you can structure around it (options/warrants at OpCo, investment advisory contract, something else creative).  If it is an advisory contract, you’ll run into Investment Advisory Act and “qualified client” issues…  but frankly I am not sure how you (or AngelList) have avoided these so far.






bfeld



If I was on the startup side, I wouldn’t want this. Regardless of the legal docs, there will be at least one situation where you have to chase down signatures and that could be the nightmare.
We’ve focused very hard on the legal dynamics around IAA and are very comfortable, but really understanding it has been non-trivial.






Felix Dashevsky



But isn’t that what the JOBS Act was about?  Like the 2000 limit you alluded to in the opening paragraph (“a lot of fanfare around […] the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have”).  Or the crowdfunding bits.  It wasn’t about broader access to fund-like structures, but to startups.  If startups want just a couple of big investors… well, we don’t need the JOBS Act at all.  If we step back, nothing we are discussing was in fact affected by the JOBS Act–FG Angels is using the “old” 506(b) pathway.






bfeld



Since we are using 506(b), you are correct. Which means that the JOBS acts is not accomplishing the goal!






Felix Dashevsky



Which was what?






Felix Dashevsky



My point is that neither the JOBS Act, nor any other rule on startup fundraising is causing any issue here.  The “99-problem” is not endemic to startup investing (like the “500-problem” is).






bfeld



I guess I just disagree. If you’ve been following what we’ve tried to do with FG Angel, it’s very much about democratizing startup investing, and the 99 investor rule is a huge disconnect from the JOBS Act goals, especially in raising the private investor cap from 500 to 2000.






Felix Dashevsky



Fair enough.  I am following FG Angel by backing it.  Although not sure if I will make it into the 99 the next time!






JMN



Brad, I concur with your position. The question is what can be done to resolve this hurdle? There’s always a solution. Jason Best and team at Crowdfund Capital Advisors (https://crowdfundcapitaladvisors.com/about-us/our-team/jason-best.html), may be a starting point.






JMN



It appears my previous comment was removed because a link to a third party’s website was included? A private company found on the net that was involved with pushing the JOBS Act legislation through. My point was there’s sure to be a solution to this problem. But it’s going to take some digging and talking to the right people who can push for change at the legislative level. Otherwise, the “99 investor problem” is here to stay, there’s no way around it.














Eddie Wharton



Could you have a 99 person Brad-FG Angels LLC, another 99 person Jason-FG Angels LLC, etc.? Instead of combining them off the cap table just include 3 different LLC’s. It would be a bit more work, is not a scalable solution past a certain point and relies enormously on the trust that you have built to make sure all of the FG Angel LLC make the exact same investments with the same terms.  
This is not an effective solution for everybody and one part of the law seems to undermine the spirit of another.  Big picture, that needs to be fixed. However, this could be a way to keep FG Angels growing and still have a low single digit number of additions to the cap table.






jasonmendelson



I wish.  SEC would look into “who is Brad / Jason” and realize we are partners and then game over.  They integrate and we are “done”






Joe Wallin



I think we ought to just repeal the investment company act…










Steve Consilvio



Stop investing and give your money away!
I love it how rich prigs think they are helping others by lending them money and then sucking the blood out of a new business. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.






Fred Destin



My personal view is that we do this one step at a time and prove we are responsible actors on a functional platform.  The 99 investor problem could also refer to 1999 when retail investors were left holding cats in bags prepared for them by professional investors.  Let’s build a strong platform with good diligence tools, social signals, evidence of track record and then go back and propose the next regulatory evolution.  I am convinced there is a day where crowdfunding will apply to startups as it applies to products on Kickstarter, but we need to make sure it’s done well.  Let’s celebrate the deregulation, demonstrate our platform works, and then fight for the next step.






bfeld



Fair enough. 
However, when the 500 shareholder limit was raised to 2,000, I don’t think anyone was paying attention to the 99 LLC rule. If there was thoughtful discussion about it, that’s cool. But my instinct is that there wasn’t. And that’s what’s frustrating / disappointing to me.
I think the gang at AngelList was just as surprised by this based on all of our work together. Since you are investors directly in AngelList, realizing that their initial view was there was no problem having larger syndicates is probably important as part of understanding how this all evolves.
As we planned from the beginning, the FG Angels experiment is just that – an experiment – so we are happy to find all the limitations, edge cases, and problems. I don’t think our behavior or performance is – or should be – a proxy for regulators as we are merely one data point, so I’m happy to be public about all the challenges we run into.








Steven Kane



Hi Brad. Re the chasing signatures issue. Couldnt the startup simply require angels who invest directly to submit to some kind of “drag along” right? Meaning, once the angel’s money is invested, no signatures are ever required ever again?






bfeld



Possibly. It’s one of the approaches we’ve looked at. We – and some of the companies we’ve talked to – aren’t comfortable with it since it still ends up with a huge number of individual investors on the cap table.








lunarmobiscuit



The Investment Act and SEC seems to have thought through every straightforward workaround.  Given that, it seems the best path is to go back and questions the assumptions.  You set up this LLC to: (a) simplify the paperwork for the investees, (b) centralize the decision making  of the syndicate, (c) prove out the AngelList crowdfunding model.
Of these, only (a) is limited by the rules.  I saw in the comments that the rules don’t allow you to run one LLC and any of your Foundry partners to run a second LLC.  But what stops any of the other 216 people in the syndicate from setting up a second LLC?  A “Not-FG Angels LLC”, whose manager receives no communications from you, but who watches AngelList to see what FG Angels invests in and follows along.
You pick 98 others to be part of FG Angels, and someone from the other 119 others not picked can choose 98 more for Not-FG Angels LLC, and so on with Truly-Not-FG Angels, until you hit the 2,000 investor limit, which I believe really has no workaround.






bfeld



That’s a valid hack and certainly open to anyone who wants to do it.






rxdxt



This is Richard Titus, founder of Prompt.ly (Foundry Syndicate investment 2) -chiming in… I agree this is a real problem. Prompt.ly was super excited about the opportunity & the democratic innovation in investment – but we were surprised the final investment amount was so much lower than commitments. (it all worked out as we were significantly oversubscribed via direct investment.) 
Perhaps syndicates could “back each other up”?  i.e. each syndicate could act as a “sub-manager” to investors who are interested in a deal, but cannot fit into the 1st 198 investors of the original syndicator?  I’d be happy to serve in this capacity for Foundry.
It should be noted we (and I hope you don’t mind we did this) “picked off” some of the obviously QP investors and invited them to invest directly to allow more people into the deal – but until the SEC & IRS solve this that seemed the best way to preserve access. – to our view the purpose of Angellist is to level the playing field for investors – particularly smaller ones and diversify the investment landscape. 
Based on my fantastic experience as an entrepreneur being backed by Foundry & it’s syndicate – I’ve started my own!  
Thanks again!






bfeld



We’re glad you picked off additional QP investors to invest directly. All good…










Henry Glover



What if the 217 members pooled together to form a firm with $25m in assets making one “qualified purchaser”  Might be silly for one deal but if you had a lot of people in a “firm” it basically makes the firm a really large syndicate.  Im guessing it would require either bigger checks, more people + a lot of deals for it to scale… vc firm






bfeld



That won’t work as the entity will have > 99 investors.








Scott Kosch



Brad, I’m in your syndicate and make the 99 cut-off because of my per-deal amount, but I also qualify as a QP.  Just got around to getting a letter from a financial institution to attest to this, but in the online form it also mentions that they might periodically run my credit history.  I don’t like the idea of having my credit run frequently (like possibly for every deal or even a few times per year), because this negatively impacts credit scores (which I think is crazy).  Can you say anything about this?  I hate to fill an accredited spot, when I could be included as a QP, but the periodic credit check gave me pause.






bfeld



I don’t know the answer to this specifically but will check.






Scott Kosch



Brad, thanks for asking AL about this.  Here is what I learned, so that others don’t shy away from validating their QP status.  The credit check they perform is called a “soft pull.”  Add your own joke to that.  It does not impact your credit score, unlike a “hard pull.”  Nevertheless, if you still want to avoid this repeated credit check for each deal, there are two ways AL may not need to check as frequently.  First, if you invest through an entity, which is wholly-owned by one or more QPs, then that entity is a QP, and they shouldn’t need to run your credit personally. Second, if you can verify that your Net Worth is greater than $5M and not just your Net Assets (i.e., your Net Worth would be less debt and other liabilities), then credit checks aren’t necessary.  Anyway, happy that I can make room for one more investor by changing my status.








TejDhawan



That’s an interesting observation. You’re correct that the credit score would likely by hit by the credit check. The credit report would generally affirm the salary based qualification requirements, but not the remaining 8 or 9, as financial assets, non-profit work, institutional mgmt etc. don’t make it into credit checks. The criminal/bankruptcy items that do make it into credit checks would apply to the companies raising the funding through FG Angels+syndicate.
Interesting question to send to AL directly as well, and this is making me think that the company raising the funds should also be providing representations that they clear the ‘bad actor disqualification’ test.

What is a syndicate?



A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry.Here's an example: Sara, a notable angel investor, decides to lead a syndicate. The syndicate investors agree to invest $200K total in each of her future deals and pay her 15% carry.When Sara makes her next investment, she offers to invest $250K in the company. She personally invests $50K and offers the remaining $200K to her syndicate.If the investment is successful, the syndicate investors first receive their $200K, after which every dollar of the syndicate’s profit is split 80% to the syndicate investors, 15% to Sara and 5% to AngelList Advisors.  AngelList Advisors is a venture capital exempt reporting advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a subsidiary of AngelList.View syndicates »

What are the benefits of syndicates?



Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments.

Updated Apr 12, 2016








How much do syndicates cost?



Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList Advisors.Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each deal—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList or AngelList Advisors does not profit from these fees.The lead and AngelList Advisors do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

Updated Apr 12, 2016








What is the legal structure of a syndicate?



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically to invest in the company.  The fund is formed as a series LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors.The lead usually does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders.

What is carry?



Carry is a share of the profit of an investment that is paid to the managers of the investment. It is short for ‘carried interest’.In a VC fund, the limited partners of the fund pay carry to the general partners if the entire fund is profitable. This is called fund carry or net carry.In syndicates, investors pay carry to the lead for any profitable investment. This is called deal carry. Syndicates use deal carry so investors can opt out of any investment or stop investing anytime.Learn more about carry and the economics of
syndicates.

Updated Sep 26, 2016








Do syndicates receive pro rata rights?



Syndicates receive pro rata rights if the lead negotiates them with the startup.  If a syndicate has pro rata rights, syndicate investors in the initial round may have the opportunity to invest their pro rata allocation in subsequent financings. Any remaining allocation may be offered to other investors or funds.  The pro rata may not be offered to syndicate investors if the lead does not participate, if it is unlikely that a reasonable amount of the pro rata will be filled, or for other reasons. Pro rata rights vary in strength and enforceability. Pro rata rights may be waivable by a majority of investors in the round or waived as a condition to a new financing round.

Leads: Do I invest through the syndicate?

Leads: What is minimum I have to invest in each deal?



The minimum investment for a lead who is investing her own money is generally 2.5% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors. The minimum investment for a lead who is investing out of a fund raised from limited partners is generally 20% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors.This minimum only applies to capital raised from individuals. Syndicates can raise an unlimited amount of capital from institutional investors such as platform funds.For example, if a lead puts $5K of her own money in a startup, she can raise an additional $195K from individual investors in her syndicate. She can also raise an unlimited amount of capital from a platform fund like CSC Upshot.The minimum investment may be reduced if a notable investor is making a significant investment in the round. It may also be reduced in pro ratas and other special situations. Investors in the syndicate will be notified if the minimum is reduced.Investors can also view the lead's investment amount in any deal and opt out of the deal, for any reason.Learn more

Leads: What happens if my allocation in a deal is smaller than my syndicate?



Each investor’s commitment will be reduced pro rata if your allocation is smaller than the total commitments from syndicate investors. Here's an example. Sara has a syndicate with 10 accepted investors. Each investor has committed $10K to the syndicate, for a total of $100K. Sara personally invests $20K in the deal and asks for an additional $100K for her syndicate. However, the startup is only able to allocate $50K to the syndicate. So each of her syndicate investors will invest $5K instead of the $10K they requested.If an investor‘s reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the investor will invest the minimum investment. In this case, if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will use her judgment to reduce investors’ amounts for that deal. The lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the company‘s markets or have large investment amounts.In some deals, a maximum may be placed on aggregate commitments by the platform funds.

Leads: Should I negotiate for pro rata rights?



Yes. Pro rata rights are important for AngelList and syndicate leads to invest additional capital in winning investments and generate larger returns. For syndicate leads this is especially valuable, since they can still earn carry in follow-on rounds. Leads should negotiate for pro rata rights on all deals.

Leads: What is the lead's carry in a pro rata?



The lead's carry in a pro rata is the same as the initial round, as long as her investment is greater than or equal to either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller.The lead's carry in a pro rata will be reduced by 5% if her investment is less than either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller. AngelList Advisors, the fund's investment adviser, will receive this additional carry in addition to its usual 5% carry. This is due to  the added work and risk, and since AngelList Advisors is less able to look to the lead’s decision when advising the fund.In both cases, if the lead does not provide access to the pro rata and provide relevant information, she will not earn any carry and AngelList will receive a total of 10% carry.

Leads: What should I name my syndicate?



Most leads use their full name for their syndicate because they expect investors to join the syndicate on the basis of their personal reputation.If you are investing on behalf of a firm or if you focus on a specific type of investment, you may wish to choose a different name for your syndicate.Investors should be able to clearly tell who is running the syndicate from the syndicate's name. The name should also not be generic or contain the word ‘syndicate’.“FG Angels” is a good name for a syndicate. “Angel” is not.“Hardware Investments by Vinod Khosla” is a good name for a syndicate. “The Hardware Syndicate” is not.

These deals may not be marketed publicly.You may market syndicated deals subject to section 506(c), commonly referred to as general solicitation.

Leads: How do I get my deal featured?



If one of the AngelList-affiliated funds invests in your deal, the AngelList team will offer to feature it. Your deal may also be featured if one of these funds approves of featuring the deal. The AngelList-affiliated funds automatically consider every syndicate deal for investment.Featuring happens with the permission of the founder. The AngelList team may feature your deal to a relevant segment of the investor base only.

Leads: Limitations on syndicate investments in certain foreign companies (PFIC & CFC)




Investments in certain types of foreign companies ares subject to disadvantaged tax treatment and  ongoing compliance requirements. 
These rules are complicated, but if the investment is in a foreign holding company it may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)  and if the investment is in a foreign company that is majority owned by US taxpayers, it may be a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). 
As a result of the added tax and  compliance burdens, AngelList does not generally facilitate investment in either PFIC's or CFC's. When a syndicate makes an investment in a non-US company, the company will be asked to certify that it is neither a PFIC nor a CFC and agree to ongoing compliance requirements. 
 A lead should confirm the PFIC / CFC status with a foreign company early on to avoid wasted efforts. Any investment in a company that cannot certify to being a non-PFIC / CFC will either not be facilitated on AngelList or will require additional disclosures and approvals from AngelList.

Investors: What am I committing to when I back a syndicate?



You are committing to invest in the syndicate’s deals, on the same terms as the lead. You also agree to pay the lead and AngelList carry on those deals as well as the out-of-pocket costs of each deal. This is not a legally-binding agreement and you can opt out of any agreement or stop investing at any time. All of your existing investments remain intact if you stop investing.

Investors: What information rights do I have?



Syndicate investors receive less information than direct investors. An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to investors when they invest in a syndicate deal:Documents related to the fund’s formation such as its operating agreement, private placement memorandum and subscription agreement.General terms of the investment, if the company permits. Templates of deal documents signed by the fund may also be made available to investors. Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is high-level information similar to the information VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information about the company’s customers or financing. It will generally not include any figures.Any information investors need for taxes, such as K-1s, is distributed annually.

Investors: When do I receive a return on my investment?



You will generally receive returns, if any, when the company is acquired or has an IPO. There may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares.When there is an exit opportunity, AngelList Advisors, in consultation with the lead, will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares. The decision to sell the shares is then made by Assure Fund Management. This will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid. If there are any profits, they are distributed to the syndicate investors.The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by  agreements with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations.

Investors: Why isn't there a higher minimum investment for leads?



Raising the minimum investment would cause some leads to stop syndicating their investments. Instead, they would start or join venture capital funds, which typically have no minimums.The
partners of a VC fund typically provide 1-5% of the fund's capital, but
also take out 15-25% in management fees. In
effect, they don't make a contribution to the fund. The minimum for leads investing their own money in a syndicate is 2.5%. And the minimum for leads investing out of a fund is 20%. Except in rare cases, leads receive no management fees from the syndicate. So, for the vast
majority of leads, syndicates are already more expensive than venture capital
funds. Raising the minimum would cause some leads to stop syndicating their
investments. They would instead invest through a venture capital fund.

Raising the minimum would also cause some leads who are new to investing to stop altogether, because it is already a significant portion of their net worth. This would lead to less diversity of investment opportunities from new leads.Investors who are unhappy with a lead's contribution can always opt out of an investment. They can also invest in AngelList Funds, which make investment decisions on behalf of investors, for no additional cost or carry.Learn more about the economics of syndicates.

Investors: What are the tax consequences of investing in a syndicate?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members of a special-purpose fund formed to make the investment. That fund will purchase preferred shares, convertible debt or other instruments issued by the company.  Certain taxable events may result in income or losses flowing through the special-purpose fund to its investors.  Investors with taxable income or loss will receive K-1s.If the fund holds an equity interest in a portfolio company, there is a taxable event on exits or when the company is dissolved or files for bankruptcy. In rare instances, there may also be a taxable event if the fund receives a dividend or distribution.  If the fund purchases convertible debt, prior to conversion into equity, there may be a tax consequence for your portion of the interest on the debt or in connection with the cancellation of debt such as in a bankruptcy. Be sure to consult your tax advisor.

Investors: What are the tax consequences for non-U.S. investors in syndicates?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members in a special-purpose vehicle, structured as a US series LLC. Each syndicate will typically send out IRS Forms K-1 to all its members, both foreign and domestic, in any year in which it has taxable income or deductible expenses. We understand from informal consultation with tax counsel that, generally, income and distributions from AngelList syndicated deals to non-US investors without substantial US business involvement are exempt from US tax and withholding requirements, provided that such investors have submitted the appropriate FATCA Related Forms. AngelList is not qualified to provide tax advice and the above should not be read as tax advice. There are many important exceptions to the generalization stated above, so please be sure to consult your tax advisor and relevant international tax treaties before making an investment.

Investors: What is a management fee?



A management fee is a quarterly or annual fee added onto a deal, meant to compensate the lead for their time and expenses. Leads may charge management fees for hiring employees, maintaining an office, paying salaries, etc. This is similar to how venture capital firms operate. However, in the case of an AngelList syndicate, because investors can opt in or out on each deal, all economics (including management fees) are calculated on a deal-by-deal basis.

Investors: Which leads can charge management fees?



This is a new feature AngelList is exploring. To start, only leads who incur substantial costs running their AngelList syndicates will charge management fees. Right now this only applies to Gil Penchina. AngelList will determine if other leads qualify for management fees in the future.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees work?



For each deal, the lifetime total management fee (ex. 3%) is collected upfront and drawn down by the lead over time (ex. 0.25% quarterly, for three years). If there's an exit before the entire management fee is drawn, undrawn capital is returned to investors. If there's a profitable exit, the lead must return the entire amount raised (including the management fee) before earning any carried interest.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees benefit investors?



Management fees allow leads to hire staff, maintain offices, and be competitive with venture capital firms that have fees at their disposal. Many of the world's top investors are VC General Partners. By introducing management fees, AngelList is better equipped to support this cohort of investors and attract them to share their deals online.Over time, many of the current syndicate leads will face financial pressure to start or join venture capital firms where they can earn fees to offset their costs. They may choose this instead of syndicating. Management fees help mitigate this financial pressure and retain leads on the AngelList platform.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do I know which deals charge management fees?



Management fees are displayed on the deal page alongside the setup costs that you pay on each deal. There is clear disclosure on deals with management fees. No additional work is required from you to participate in these deals. As always, you should review deal terms before participating and opt out on deals where you don’t like the terms. There are dozens of leads on AngelList with quality deal flow and no management fees.

Startups: Can my company be syndicated?

Startups: How many investors are added to my cap table?

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Startups: Do syndicate investors count towards my company’s shareholder limit?

Startups: How do I post updates to my syndicate?



You can post an update by selecting the ‘For Investors’ tab on your startup profile.You are not required to share any information or communicate with your syndicate. But many companies choose to post monthly updates and ask investors for help. Syndicate investors are often experts in your market and can provide advice and introductions.Although investors are under NDA and forbidden from forwarding confidential information, you should only share information at your own risk.

If you are provided with access to a syndicate deal, review information provided by the company and the deal lead carefully.

Unformatted text preview: CASE: E-520
DATE: 06/15/14 ANGELLIST:
CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE OF INVESTING
In April 2014, Naval Ravikant took stock of AngelList, the company that he had cofounded four
years previously to help start-ups and entrepreneurs. AngelList had started as a blog1 with
advice and information for entrepreneurs—a “side project” that Ravikant and cofounder Babak
Nivi undertook to give back to the start-up community. The blog grew into an online platform
where start-ups and investors could discover each other, eventually evolving into a ubiquitous
tool in early stage investing (see Exhibit 1). AngelList had accomplished Ravikant’s initial goal
of breaking down the “old boy networks” of seed and venture capital investing. Now,
Ravikant’s vision for AngelList was to create even more transparent and liquid markets for
various services that start-ups consumed, including fundraising and talent acquisition. AngelList
had recently launched two products with the aim to upend the early stage investment and
recruiting industries.
Earlier, in September 2013, AngelList had launched Syndicates, a product that enabled the best
early stage investors to pool their own capital with that from a group of “backers” to make larger
investments in start-ups. AngelList had built a nearly completely automated online interface to
facilitate these transactions, removing much of the transaction costs and administrative friction
that previously made these types of investments difficult. Syndicates allowed more investors to
access early stage investments and to diversify their investment budget to amounts as low as
$1,000 per start-up. Over 70 Syndicate deals that had been completed on AngelList by April
2014. However, these were just the tip of the iceberg to Ravikant. He commented:
The world that I see coming is one in which a high-quality investor goes and
meets with a start-up. When they decide to invest, they pull up their iPad, they
sign their name with their finger, and they swipe a debit card. Others who believe
in this investor’s capability and know that he is credible from various signals, can
1 A blog is the truncated term for a web log, a set of individual postings that are published on the World Wide Web.
Yin Li (MBA 2013) and Lecturer Robert Siegel prepared this case as the basis for class discussion rather than to
illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.

Now, in April 2014, Ravikant was working hard to grow the pool of capital behind AngelList’s
Syndicate leads. He hoped that in the future, both retail investors and institutional investors
would be able to investment through Syndicates. In fact, Syndicates would be a means for
institutional investors to directly access early-stage deals and bypass middlemen—fund-of-funds
and even venture capital funds—and their management and performance-based fees.
Since December 2013, AngelList had also started to monetize its talent portal, which for some
time had been making free matches between candidates on its platform and talent-hungry
technology companies. AngelList estimated that it was making approximately 4,000 matches
resulting in 200 hires each week. AngelList Talent had developed a reputation for delivering
high-quality leads to both candidates and employers, and it was being used by both start-ups and
later-staged technology companies such as Yelp and Uber. As of April 2014, AngelList was
charging companies $2,000 per full-time hire made through the platform, a small fraction of
prevailing recruiting fees. Ravikant wondered what other types of matches he could help startups make, for example, connecting them with lawyers, accountants, and even customers.
Ravikant was excited by the potential of AngelList. The platform had already brought several
innovations to the early stage investment ecosystem. Now the question was whether AngelList
could execute its full vision and make an even bigger “dent in the universe.”
COMPANY BACKGROUND
AngelList was founded by Naval Ravikant and Babak Nivi in 2010 as a platform to connect
entrepreneurs in need of seed funding with angel investors. AngelList was an extension of
Venture Hacks, a blog authored by Ravikant and Nivi to educate entrepreneurs on the ins and
outs of starting a company and raising money.
Naval Ravikant
Naval Ravikant graduated from Dartmouth College with degrees in computer science and
economics in 1995 and spent the following decade in Silicon Valley as a founder of technology
companies. In 1999, Ravikant cofounded Epinions, a consumer product review website. In
2003, Epinions was acquired by Dealtime in a transaction that rendered Ravikant and other
founders’ shares worthless. Yet, a year later, the new company went public as Shopping.com 2 The cloud refers to a model of computing where applications run on networks of servers, typically utilized by

who had left sued the remaining founder and Epinons’ investors Benchmark Capital and August
Capital for withholding material information. After the suit was settled in 2005, Ravikant went
on to found online classified marketplace Vast.com. In 2007, Ravikant became an investor,
when he raised a $20 million fund called The Hit Forge, which invested in a number of notable
companies, including Twitter, Uber, and Foursquare.5
Babak Nivi
Babak Nivi graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with bachelor’s and
master’s degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, and was in the course of
completing his PhD when he decided to change direction and pursue a career as a venture capital
investor. Nivi worked as an associate at Seed Capital Partners, and also as an Entrepreneur-inResidence (EIR) at Bessemer and Atlas Venture. In 2005, Nivi became a vice president at
Songbird, an Atlas Ventures portfolio company. Nivi had a growing realization that there was a
great asymmetry of information between entrepreneurs and investors. Venture capital investors
were almost always more sophisticated and knew more about fundraising than entrepreneurs, and
the two parties’ interests were not always aligned.
Venture Hacks
While Nivi was working for Songbird, Ravikant advised him on how to manage the fundraising
process and conduct negotiations with investors. The duo decided to start Venture Hacks, a blog
that would distill the advice that Ravikant had given Nivi and other entrepreneurs over time.
Posts covered a variety of useful topics, including “How to pick a co-founder” and “How to
make a cap table.”6
Venture Hacks became a popular resource for entrepreneurs looking to understand the process of
starting a company. Nivi and Ravikant found themselves fielding frequent requests for referrals
to investors. The two soon realized that entrepreneurs needed more than advice—they were also
hungry for introductions to investors. Ravikant empathized with entrepreneurs in this area. He
commented:
Companies were connecting with investors in a very inefficient and slow manner.
Introductions were made one-by-one and then everybody would hoard
introductions like they were this magic currency. This is because when an
investor finds a company, they want to keep it to themselves. They want to
basically lock the deal down, make sure it doesn’t have a lot of options, and write
the check. The attitude was “if I give you an intro you owe me something.” 4 “Epinions,” Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions (March 31, 2014).

that if you’re a high-quality start-up, you should meet everybody, and everybody
should want to meet with you. Why should you be restricted to the few people
you’ve been able to talk to?
In February 2010, the Venture Hacks founders launched AngelList, which they announced as “a
curated list of super high-quality angel investors. And how to reach them.”7 The site debuted
with over 50 angels but quickly grew to 80 as additional investors created profiles.8 AngelList
became a platform where start-ups and investors created profiles and could follow each other,
send private messages, or request an introduction (see Exhibit 2).
In July 2011, eighteen months into its existence, AngelList announced that it had made 8,000
introductions between investors and start-ups. Of those introductions, 400 resulted in
investments.9 One entrepreneur described the experience of fundraising through the platform:
Recently, using AngelList has changed the way I've been fundraising. Where
traditionally, I've had to dedicate a block of time to fundraise full time, I can now
fundraise passively, meaning just by focusing on having an optimized AngelList
presence and a few specific techniques, I don't have to spend blocks of my time
finding high-quality angels. That is a game changer for us—fundraising is an
incredibly distracting process, and it's especially hard to innovate and iterate on
your start-up when you're distracted by bolstering the company's bank account.
Being able to have angels come to me has given me a freedom as an entrepreneur
that's just fantastic.10
By the end of 2012, there were some 40,000 companies (16,000 of which were raising money)
and 5,000 accredited investors on AngelList.11
SEARCHING FOR A BUSINESS MODEL
As AngelList grew rapidly, Ravikant and Nivi began to think about how they could turn the
platform into a business. AngelList had already accomplished bringing both start-ups and
investors together online. The next challenge was to figure out the best way to monetize the
connections that were being made on the platform while continuing to deliver on their mission of
helping entrepreneurs and start-ups. 7 Babak Nivi, “Launch: AngelList, a curated list of angel investors,” Venture Hacks, February 2, 2010,

Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 5 Transaction Fee
AngelList decided against charging either investors or start-ups (or both) a transaction fee for
several reasons. First, U.S. financial regulations required AngelList to become a broker dealer in
order to charge a transaction fee, but broker dealers were highly regulated by the government.
Ravikant stated, “Being a broker dealer means you have all these regulations and requirements
that actually make it impossible to work with start-ups.”12
Further, the founders believed that there was a high likelihood of adverse selection if AngelList
were to charge a transaction fee. Both high-quality start-ups and investors who needed
AngelList less to access each other could choose to leave the platform in order to avoid the fee.
Ravikant and Nivi wanted to maximize the participation of both companies and investors on the
platform.
Finally, charging a transaction fee was at the time difficult to implement because the fundraising
activity that happened after the AngelList introductions was completed offline. Identifying and
getting access to high-quality start-ups—a very small fraction of start-ups on AngelList were of
investment quality—was a highly competitive process for investors. As such, while investors
were happy to browse and get introduced to companies, many took to using telephone, e-mail,
and in person meetings thereafter. Investors were hesitant to make public their interest in a startup (e.g., by following them) until post-transaction because they did not want others to discover
the company.
Due to investors’ preference to conduct investment activity off the AngelList platform, the
company was aware of approximately only half of all closed transactions that resulted from its
introductions. AngelList gathered transaction data primarily by indirect means. Ash Fontana,
who worked on AngelList’s fundraising products, commented on how the platform tracked
investment activity in its early days:
We heard anecdotes, but we also tried to automate it a bit. We’d ping the
founders when they got a lot of intros, to say, “Hey, you should add these folks as
your investors.” Alternatively, we’d see the investor later add themselves, and
then we’d see that they’d previously gotten an intro, so we could infer that the
investment was made as a result of an AngelList introduction.
Invest Online
In December 2012, AngelList launched a partnership with SecondMarket, an online marketplace
with broker dealer status. SecondMarket allowed investors to buy and sell illiquid assets online,
including limited partnership interests and private company stock. The partnership with
SecondMarket was a test of an investment vehicle—an LLC13, comprised of a group of investors
each individually contributing a small amount. The LLC pooled the capital the investors, and as
a single legal entity, made an investment in a startup.

Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 6 AngelList piloted Invest Online with 18 start-ups on its platform. To ensure the quality of the
companies in the pilot, each start-up had to have a lead investor willing to invest $100,000, a
sum that the company leadership considered to be the equivalent of a vote of confidence from a
community member with credibility. The minimum total investment by the LLC vehicle was
$200,000. Therefore, aside from the lead investor, there had to be at least an additional $100,000
of interest from other investors, who accepted the terms pre-negotiated by the lead. Only
accredited investors could participate in these transactions. In a press report, Ravikant
commented on the benefits of Invest Online for start-ups:
Instead of raising offline, you could get the bulk of your capital online without
hassle. And you could incorporate both small and large supporters in a round
without complication.
There were significant transaction costs and other frictions associated with the Invest Online
model, including creating the LLC and transferring money from all the investors into one
account. Additionally, a high level of coordination was needed to move a large group of
investors through the process. SecondMarket initially handled all of the back office operations.
AngelList estimated that it paid approximately $30,000 in legal and administrative fees per startup that fundraised using Invest Online
Over the next several months, AngelList automated each step of creating, marketing, and closing
an Invest Online transaction. By building its own back office and funds management
capabilities, AngelList was able to reduce the transaction costs by nearly 65 percent. These
included automating the tasks of bank account creation and the document signing.
Regulatory Relief
In response to the stock market crash of 1929, it had been illegal since the early 1930s for
American companies to fundraise publicly, known as engaging in “general solicitation.”
Companies raising funds through private offerings (i.e., not through an Initial Public Offering on
the stock market) were limited to word of mouth and other forms of private communications as
means of marketing their fundraising activity. These financial regulations had been crafted over
80 years previously with the aim of preventing companies from taking advantage of
unsophisticated investors, so called “widowers and orphans.” The ban on general solicitation put
many start-up fundraising-related activities, including those that took place in incubators and
various online crowd-funding platforms, in regulatory gray areas. Although AngelList did not
engage in crowd-funding and only worked with accredited investors,14 the regulatory
environment was nevertheless something of which the company had to be mindful.
In March 2013, AngelList received a “no action” letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), which served as assurance that Invest Online (later rebranded as Syndicates)
would not trigger enforcement action from the SEC. Additionally, the SEC confirmed that
AngelList could earn a performance-based fee (i.e., a carry) without broker-dealer status under 14 Accredited investors are sophisticated investors that have wealth or income levels above a certain threshold. The
U.S. government deems that only accredited investors can make certain types of investments. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:

performance-based and transaction-based compensation:
When AngelList receives a carry from investors, it is considered performancebased compensation and not transaction-based as in we don't make more money
necessarily just based on doing more volume, and we don't make money based on
exactly how much investors are investing. We make money if investors make
money based on the performance of the investment.
Further, in July 2013, the SEC voted to implement a section of the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups (JOBS) Act, which lifted the ban on general solicitation. With a great part of the
regulatory uncertainty lifted, AngelList moved forward with scaling Invest Online.
Fundraising
In September 2013, AngelList raised $24 million in financing. Industry press reported that the
valuation was approximately $150 million.15 Google Ventures and Atlas Ventures led the round,
but over 100 other investors participated as well. These included both several large venture
capital funds, including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Kleiner Perkins, as well as dozens of angel
investors. AngelList completed its own fundraising using Syndicates, which it had debuted in
the same month.
SYNDICATES
Syndicates allowed a lead investor to bring other investors into a pre-negotiated transaction with
a start-up. A Syndicate lead had a band of “backers”—other AngelList investors who made a
non-binding commitment to invest in deals that the lead set up. Syndicate leads earned a carry of
zero percent to 15 percent from backers for each transaction. AngelList would also earn a 5
percent carry from backers for facilitating the transaction.
For example, Ben Davenport, an early stage investor and software engineer at Facebook, led a
Syndicate to invest in Bitcoin16 companies. As of March 2014, Davenport’s backers had soft
committed $532,000 to Davenport’s investments. On his profile, Davenport stated that he
expected his Bitcoin Syndicate to invest in six deals per year. In each of these transactions,
Davenport expected he would contribute $30,000 while backers would contribute a minimum of
$5,000 each to make up the balance of the investment (the minimum total investment size set by
AngelList for Syndicates transactions was $200,000). Backers of each of Davenport’s deals
would pay him a 10 percent carry and AngelList a 5 percent carry. Davenport’s Syndicate page
included the following description of why investors should back him:

since mid-2011, and have been a seed investor in BitPay, Coinsetter, itBit and

investors called SVBitcoin, which I would also invite my syndicate members to
participate in. I believe in 2014 and beyond, there will be a new wave of
entrepreneurs attacking the problems in the space: usability, security, liquidity, as
well as building the next layers on top of the base protocol. My angel investments
are not exclusively in Bitcoin start-ups, but they will be the focus for this
syndicate.17
Another example was Karl Jacob, an angel investor who led another Syndicate on AngelList.
Jacob’s Syndicate profile stated, “I have proprietary deal flow, and I am often the first call an
entrepreneur makes to raise funds. In two recent deals I was the only angel asked to invest…I
will try to Syndicate all my deals.” As of April 2014, Jacob had eight backers whose backings
totaled $16,500. Jacob expected that he would lead 15 Syndicate deals per year, with a typical
investment from him of $50,000 and a minimum backer investment of $1,000. Backers paid
Jacob a 15 percent carry, and AngelList a 5 percent carry.18
As of April 2014, start-ups had raised over $28 million through 72 completed Syndicates deals.
And 42 active Syndicates had made at least one investment in a start-up. Fontana estimated that
the average Syndicate transaction was close to $240,000, and that the average backer invested
approximately $10,000 per transaction.
How Syndicates Worked
Currently, AngelList carefully screened each potential Syndicate deal to ensure it had a high
likelihood of closing. To assess a deal’s viability, AngelList considered factors including the
number of backers behind the Syndicate lead. AngelList also considered whether the lead had
negotiated an investment allocation with a start-up that had limited access or was even
oversubscribed. If so, the Syndicate lead would be providing some of high value to backers.
Once a deal was syndicated on AngelList, the lead’s backers automatically received a
“reservation” to invest in the start-up. Up to this point, backers could still choose not to
participate, while other investors on AngelList that were not backers could also join. AngelList
sometimes helped market the deal by featuring it on the Syndicates web page. Additionally,
other investors could also discover and join the deal if they were following an existing backer.
If the interest level exceeded the lead’s allocation, then the lead (and sometimes the start-up)
curated the list of final investors, with priority generally going to the Syndicate’s backers. The
process of filling up a Syndicate transaction varied significantly with some deals being
oversubscribed early on and others requiring up to six to eight weeks of marketing.
The finalized set of investors then joined AngelList’s online closing environment. An
investment vehicle was formed, and a bank account was started where investors wired their
money (AngelList never directly touched the money). Investors also completed legal and
administrative paperwork online. As of April 2014, this process could take several weeks,

was a competitive advantage for early stage investors—Syndicates that were dragging their feet
to close risked being displaced by another investor if the start-up became impatient. As such,
AngelList was working on shortening the time to close by automating as many steps as possible.
The platform was also considering moving towards having backers pre-fund accounts for their
Syndicates, in lieu of the current soft-commitment model.
Syndicate Leads
Syndicates allowed certain investors to put more money to work in companies that they had
identified and to earn a carry for providing other investors with access. Leads were also able to
invest in a larger universe of companies and were better positioned to negotiate with them, as a
result of being able to write larger checks. Many well-known and well-connected angel
investors quickly launched Syndicates on AngelList, as did lower-profile investors (such as those
that were employed at leading technology companies) who had a good pulse on start-ups that
were being formed within their networks. AngelList helped these investors gain greater reach by
featuring their Syndicates.
Additionally, some early stage and venture capital investment funds, as well as incubators, also
started Syndicates. These included Foundry Group, Social Leverage LLC, and 500 start-ups.19
Also, general partners of several venture funds also started Syndicates under their own name.
Brad Feld, managing director at Foundry Group commented in a blog post:
After joking that every VC [venture capitalist] in the U.S. was at this moment
discussing AngelList and how it might, or might not, impact them, we decided to
do something. Rather than talk, we decided to participate. After discussing a few
different ways to engage, we decided to form FG Angels, through which we’ll be
an active funder on AngelList.20
AngelList believed that funds and incubators were starting Syndicates because identifying and
vetting start-ups was a resource-intensive process and Syndicates allowed them to leverage their
brands to put more capital to work. Fontana predicted that some early stage funds would
effectively transfer their seed investment programs onto AngelList.
Syndicate Investors
Investors reaped several benefits by investing through Syndicates. Backers were able to access
in-demand start-ups and leverage the due diligence conducted by the lead investor. Syndicates
also had no management fees and often a lower total carry compared to early stage investment
funds, which typically charged a 1 to 2 percent annual management fee in addition to a 20
percent carry. With minimum investments from backers starting at $1,000, AngelList also
enabled more individuals to become early stage investors. Additionally, existing investors could
also diversify their investment budget over a larger set of companies.

investing in deals discovered socially on AngelList, Mark Suster, a venture capital investor,
commented, “social proof can be helpful. But it can also be destructive. It certainly shouldn’t be
a proxy for good judgment.”21
Hunter Walk, who managed a seed stage venture fund, wrote a blog post titled “AngelList
Syndicates Will Also Pit Angel Against Angel.” Walk predicted that since Syndicate leads
commanded larger check sizes, there would be fewer spots for angels investing in smaller
amounts in any given transaction, which would increase competition between angels going
forward.22
Start-ups with Syndicated Investors
Syndicates had several near-term benefits for start-ups, but also possibly some long-term
drawbacks that were difficult to predict because of the short track record of the investment
model. Syndicates allowed a start-up to raise money from a large group of investors but only
interface with the lead investor. Investments were completed through a hassle-free online
interface. Start-ups with a small amount of space left in their fundraising round could also have
multiple investors participate through a Syndicate, which was particularly valuable when a
vertical-focused group, such as the Bitcoin Syndicate, could bring many experts within one
vehicle. These specialized Syndicates were quickly becoming must-have investors for start-ups
in some verticals.
With the ability to invest larger amounts, angel investors could better compete with venture
capital funds in larger financing rounds, allowing companies to be funded by angel investors for
longer periods of their life. This was significant because angel investors had a reputation of
being more “start-up” friendly than venture capital funds. One reason for the perception was that
some venture capital funds managed large pools of capital from institutional investors and were
not incentivized to provide portfolio companies with attention and support unless they had the
potential to be home-runs that could move the needle on the fund’s returns. Angel investors
typically invested their personal capital and were perceived to want to work with start-ups out of
a balance of personal interest and financial gains.
However, pundits also warned of potential negative consequences for start-ups that take
investments from Syndicates. Semil Shah, a technology columnist and investor, wrote on his
blog that, “founders will need to stay vigilant about the benefits/risks of having their leads
syndicate to retail level.”23 Shah questioned the ability of certain types of syndicates, especially
those formed by large and disparate groups of investors, to provide start-ups with support and
bridge financing during difficult times. AngelList pointed out that the vast majority of Syndicate

Maiden Lane
In March 2014, industry press reported that a firm named Maiden Lane (the street in San
Francisco where AngelList’s office was then located) had raised a $25 million fund to invest in
AngelList Syndicates. Laws, AngelList’s COO, would be a partner of Maiden Lane and
Ravikant would be on the fund’s investment committee.24
Maiden Lane was a fund backed by institutional investors and was designed to allow them to
access early stage companies without the fees associated with typical seed funds. Instead,
Maiden Lane’s limited partners would make investments through AngelList’s Syndicate leads,
which Ravikant believed were the best-positioned and best-trained people to identify and
evaluate early stage investments. Maiden Lane would have no management fee. Further, while
the fund would earn a carry from its investors, the carry would be distributed to the Syndicate
leads. Ravikant elaborated:
Maiden Lane will create a new breed of micro-venture capitalists [syndicate
leads] who don’t charge management fees and who lead with their own capital.
Institutional investors can track and trace them every step of the way, and an
investor can fire and hire a lead with one click on their dashboard. And on the
other side the Syndicate leads are now managers who can start or stop investing at
any time. They can raise their carry if they are successful, they can pull in more
funds every single day. They don’t have to be locked in to the status quo
fundraising cycle and fund structure. Maiden Lane and AngelList create a
dynamic, smooth, liquid market for venture capital at the early stages where today
no market exists.
Maiden Lane was Ravikant’s vision for the future of early stage investing. Under existing
industry standards, institutional investors often paid several layers of management and
performance-fees to access early stage companies. If successful, Maiden Lane-like investment
vehicles would allow investors to pay only one performance-based fee to Syndicate leads.
Self-Syndication
In April 2014, AngelList launched self-syndication—a variation on Syndicates where start-ups
can create Syndicate on their own. Self-syndication required a start-up to have a $100,000
commitment from a high-quality investor. However, self-syndicated start-ups had no lead
investor and backers of a self-syndicated start-up paid 10 percent carry to AngelList (see Exhibit
5). 24 Dan Primack, “Maiden Lane launches to back AngelList syndicates,” Fortune, March 13, 2014,

Meanwhile, AngelList was also working on monetizing the talent introductions it had been
making between candidates and companies since August 2012. Talent began as a byproduct of
the fundraising platform when start-ups that failed to fundraise or otherwise fizzled began to
approach the AngelList team for ideas on their next steps. AngelList recognized that many of
the founders from these failed start-ups were highly employable developers that were needed by
other start-ups that were successful and hungry for more talent. Kyan Pardiwalla, an AngelList
engineer, took on the project of building a product to connect the talent from start-ups that didn’t
make it with start-ups that did.
AngelList Talent was composed of profiles of companies and available jobs and profiles of
candidates. AngelList made matches between companies and candidates by having both sides
evaluate each other using a yes/no interface. Candidate could browse jobs on the site.
AngelList’s site described the different ways candidates could respond to job postings:
When you press “Yes, I'm Interested” the startup is notified. If they click “Yes”
on your profile too, we do an email introduction…add a note to the startup with a
few words on why you'd be a great fit.
When you press “No, Archive” the startup is not notified and they never see your
profile. You can press ☆ to add the startup to your Starred list and return to it
later.
Startups can see how many times you've clicked “Yes” in the last 30 days.
Pardiwalla designed AngelList Talent to maximize the opportunity for matches to occur, and to
eliminate what he termed “recruiter spam” which was typical of existing talent platforms.
Pardiwalla commented:
I was pretty personally dissatisfied how recruiting in the industry was happening
and how many unwanted communications I received from recruiters. I thought it
was just not the best way the world could work. For example, on most online
services, I am just one of a large pile of résumés that recruiters who have paid
$1,000 to $2,000 a month have access to. All they do is search for the term
“Ruby” in those resumes and maybe I did a Ruby project at some point in the past
and now I get all this spam for the rest of my life. So it's not really the best way
for recruiting to work.
AngelList asked candidates to fill out profiles with the aim of accurately and succinctly
summarizing “what a person was all about.” The profile collected and structured information
such as education and employment history and also links to projects that candidates had
completed (see Exhibit 6). Further, candidates were asked to provide a “Headline” about
themselves as well as description of their most impressive accomplishment. Additionally,
companies could see how many times a candidate had said “Yes” to a job posting within the last
30 days, which let them know the candidate’s level of selectivity. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:

Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 13 Companies provided information on the product, founders, funding, and level of traction. They
also wrote an answer to the prompt “Why us” and included the salary and equity range for each
job posted. AngelList also identified and put in a special section jobs that were from candidates’
personal networks.
AngelList also added privacy controls, which were designed to make candidates feel comfortable
about creating a talent profile without drawing the attention of their existing employers,
investors, and coworkers. Candidates could label themselves as “Actively Looking,” “Just
Browsing,” or even “Secret.” If a candidate created a secret profile, only start-ups that s/he had
said “Yes” to could view the profile.
Monetizing AngelList Talent
Initially, AngelList provided talent introductions for free. The product had been designed to
“make the intro and get out of the way.” However, by December 2013, AngelList was making
almost 3,000 introductions on a weekly basis, and the platform was generating very positive user
feedback from the technology community. One company that had successfully recruited through
AngelList wrote the following glowing review on the question-and-answer community website
Quora:
AngelList Talent is the best kept secret in hiring—although probably not for long.
We found our server-side architect, our RF [radio frequency] engineer, and our
hopefully-soon-to-be UX [user experience] lead via AngelList…The quality of
the talent has been really high and most importantly everyone we've interacted
with has had very realistic expectations about what a role in a start-up implies,
which has been refreshing. Part of it is due to the quality of companies and people
on AL [AngelList], but IMO [in my opinion] it is also due to the lack of
anonymity and lack of any contrived gamification/points/ratings systems on the
site.25
Another user commented:
My own theory is AL is different because it doesn't focus on what a start-up "will
do," but rather focuses on what a start-up "is doing". For example, screen shots,
demonstrations, lists of team members, founders, advisors, & investors. I'd take a
1 page AL profile over a 20 page business plan every day of the week.
AngelList decided to test charging companies for hires through AngelList introductions. Market
research showed that recruiters typically charged companies approximately 30 percent of the first
year’s salaries per hire that they enabled, or approximately $40,000 per hire and up to $70,000
for a very senior level hire. 25 “What do people think about AngelList Talent?,” Quora, http://www.quora.com/AngelList/What-do-peoplethink-about-AngelList-Talent (June 7, 2014). This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 14 AngelList experimented with a pricing model where companies could choose to pay either 10
percent of the first year salary or 0.25 percent of equity. The equity payment had been designed
to help small start-ups that did not have very much cash to spend on recruiting fees. However,
very small start-ups were confused by paying with equity, but also thought the cash fee was too
high. AngelList subsequently lowered the fee to $2,000 per full-time hire, and free for
contractors and part-time hires.
AngelList believed the right price was somewhere between $2,000 to $10,000 per hire, and were
continuing to test different pricing strategies. The company was also working to “close the loop”
on hires: tracking when companies hired someone as a result of an AngelList introduction and
collecting its fee. While AngelList kept track of introductions to hires by analyzing profile tags,
it currently only charged companies that confirmed by e-mail in an honor-based system.
The company was also looking forward to growing its talent profiles to functions and roles
beyond its current demographics, which were skewed towards developers and designers. For
example, AngelList would like to see more profiles for sales and marketing and business
candidates. Helping cofounders identify and connect with each other, too, was a goal.
LOOKING FORWARD
Ravikant was proud of how AngelList had helped numerous start-ups raise money and make key
hires over the previous several years. In the process, AngelList products had also increased the
access investors had to deals and enabled the most successful investors build their own
investment businesses.
Ravikant was also excited by the potential of AngelList to further transform the landscape of
early stage investing. Syndicates had many growth opportunities, including entering new
verticals such as real estate and entertainment, penetrating geographies outside Silicon Valley,
and covering later stage financing rounds. AngelList was also working hard to persuade
institutional investors to adopt this new investment channel, which could save them several
layers of fees. Already, there was some traction, as demonstrated by the Maiden Lane fund.
However, Ravikant also kept in mind several risks and uncertainties that AngelList would need
to weather. These included the regulatory risk that would likely always be an overhang.
Although AngelList had received a “no action” letter from the SEC which had provided a
reasonable amount of comfort, Ravikant was nevertheless aware that he was operating in a
highly regulated industry.
There was execution risk as well. To scale Syndicates, AngelList needed to accelerate the speed
with which deals could be completed on the platform. Ravikant had already noticed some
venture capital investors trying to displace Syndicates in transactions that were taking too long to
close. These investors tried to persuade startups who were in the process of a Syndicates
transaction on AngelList to take money for other sources instead. To that end, the company was
trying to move towards a pre-funded account approach, which would ensure that funds moved
quickly once a Syndicate lead decided to invest. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 15 AngelList was also vulnerable to the timing of the end of the current cycle of economic growth.
When that time came, there would be a pullback in investors’ appetites for new investments. As
such, the best time for AngelList to gain traction with institutional investors would be while the
cycle was still in its upward phase. Could Ravikant and his team execute on the scaling of
Syndicates within this window? The pullback would also be a test of how investors on the
platform would behave in AngelList’s first trough. Laws believed that AngelList investors were
better capitalized than the industry on average and would weather the downturn relatively well.
The sentiment of the community towards AngelList as a social platform, though it had been
positive to date, was also unpredictable. Laws commented:
We are riding a social wave that we don’t have control over. We don’t have the
numbers to know what the market we’re growing into is and so I don’t even know
when we start to top out. It’s all a social phenomenon that we’re a part of and you
always have this little thought, “what if it stops?” in the back of your mind. If it
was another type of business, I can turn up the marketing spend and get more
growth. Our levers here are amorphous—we are serving the community better to
keep the growth going.
For the previous several years, AngelList had undergone a period of significant growth and of
innovation in products. However, it was still possible that the platform could lose its popularity
if powerful investors turned against it. Naysayers had cropped up once in a while, but so far
none had managed to sway the community away from the platform.
Despite the risks and uncertainties, however, Ravikant was excited as he looked towards
AngelList’s future. He wondered how early stage investing would continue to transform over
the next 10 to 20 years, and what AngelList’s role would be in that process. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:

Excerpts from AngelList’s Help Section
What is AngelList?
AngelList is a platform for startups to meet investors, candidates and incubators. It was started in
Jan 2010 by Babak Nivi and Naval Ravikant, who also write Venture Hacks.
How are the investors on AngelList verified?
All the investors have stated that they are accredited. The vast majority of the investors have also
made several angel investments.
You should verify that every investor you raise money from is accredited, whether or not you use
AngelList. And you should treat each investor you meet on AngelList as if you just met them on
the street. We give you information about each investor and display the source of that
information, but we don't claim that they're good people.
How do I contact investors?
You can message anyone who follows you or your startup. You can also message anyone who
requests an intro to your startup.
Next, you can ask people on your team to forward your messages to their followers. And the
AngelList team may also give you permission to message certain people.
Finally, you can message anyone who messages you first.
How do I prevent investors from stealing my idea?
If you're obviously fund-able (e.g. you previously started a company that made lots of money for
its investors), don't add a lot of information to your profile. If you're not obviously fund-able,
consider the risk of sharing your idea to be a cost of doing business. If you're not willing to take
this risk, don't use AngelList. Also keep in mind that it is rare for someone to care enough about
your idea to “steal” it. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:

Exhibit 3
Excerpts from AngelList’s Syndicates Help Section
What is a syndicate?
A syndicate allows investors to co-invest with other notable investors. People who back a
notable investor's syndicate commit to invest in their future deals, and agree to pay them carry.
What are the benefits of syndicates?
Backers get access to dealflow, leads get carry and startups get access to capital.
Backers get access to the lead's dealflow and benefit from her experience in picking and
managing investments. Backers can invest much less than the startup's minimum for a direct
investment.
Leads get carry and leverage on their personal investments. They get to invest 5-10x their typical
investment amount, which gives them access to more deals, allows them to lead more deals and
provides access to startups with higher minimum commitments. Their larger investment amounts
may also bring major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to their backers' networks so they
can provide additional value to their investments.
Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of an investor who is
committing 5-10x their typical investment. They get access to the backers' networks without
putting each one on the cap table. And they can collect many small investments without a lot of
hassle.
How do syndicates work?
Here's an example.
Sara, a notable angel, decides to lead a syndicate. Investors ‘back’ her syndicate by agreeing to
invest $200K in each of her future deals and pay her a 15% carry.
The next time Sara decides to invest in a startup, she asks the company for a $250K allocation.
She personally invests $50K in the startup and offers an opportunity to invest up to $200K to her
backers.
Can investors who don't back a lead still invest in that lead's deals?
Yes. Non-backers can make reservations in syndicated deals, very much like making a
reservation in a company that is accepting online investments.
Non-backers invest in the same fund as the backers and the syndicate lead. Non-backers also pay
the same carry as the backers.
When a deal is oversubscribed, backer reservations generally have priority over non-backer
reservations.
What do syndicates cost?
Backers pay 5-20% carry, per deal, to the syndicate lead, and 5% to AngelList.
Startups pay nothing as long as the syndicate fund closes above $150,000. Otherwise, either the
lead or the company pays a one-time fee that covers the legal and administrative costs of closing
the fund and managing it for its lifetime. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 19 What's the legal structure for a syndicate?
Syndicate investors don't invest directly in the company but a special purpose vehicle LLC that is
created for each specific investment. The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and
advised by the lead and AngelList Advisors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AngelList.
AngelList Advisors and the lead receive the carried interest as Special Members of the syndicate.
The lead is required to advise the fund, tell the fund how they voted (or would vote) their shares
and if they buy or sell shares. The fund will generally follow unless there's a good reason not to
(e.g., conflict of interest).
What is carry?
Carry is a percentage of the profit of a fund, if any.
In syndicates, a special purpose fund is created for each syndicated deal. If that deal returns a
profit to the backers, the lead receives a carry.
This is different from venture capital funds which make several investments out of a single fund.
In a VC fund, the profitable investments must compensate for the unprofitable ones for the
general partners to receive a carry. The GPs may also have to return a minimum profit to their
limited partners for the GPs receive carry—this is known as a hurdle rate.
Since syndicate leads don't have to compensate for their unprofitable investments or return a
minimum profit to receive carry, they can charge a lower carry than traditional VC funds.
Who can see a syndicated deal?
The syndicate lead can choose whether information about the deal will be made available to
specific backers only, to the general AngelList investor community, or (with the company’s
permission) to the general public of even logged out AngelList users and the press.
Regardless of who sees it, the lead, along with the founders, will ultimately pick which investors
can participate.
Leads: How do I create a syndicate?
To create a syndicate, click the Syndicate tab. You'll need to fill in some basic information for
backers, including how many deals you expect to syndicate each year, and your normal
investment size.
To syndicate a deal, hit the "Syndicate a Deal" button in the lower right of the Manage Syndicate
page. The minimum deal size (your allocation in the round) is $200K.
Leads: What am I committing to?
Syndicate leads commit to providing a written investment thesis for each of their investments
and disclosing potential conflicts of interest such as warrants, advisory shares or an investment in
a previous round. They are also required to make a significant investment in each of their
syndicated deals, and to review and screen potential investors in each deal. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 20 Leads will need to sign a side letter making them an advisor of our fund manager, Assure Fund
Management, and register as an exempt reporting advisor with FINRA.
Leads are not required to syndicate every deal they invest in.
Leads should be prepared to field inquiries from backers about their investments, even though
backers have limited information rights.
Leads: Who can back my syndicate?
Any accredited investor can apply to back a syndicate. Leads can then accept or reject them.
Leads can also remove a backer at any time.
Leads should consider accepting only experienced investors, people they trust and people they
want to work with. Experienced investors will be less likely to stop backing a syndicate or opt
out of a specific deal. Inexperienced backers may also have unrealistic expectations about the
returns they will realize on their investments.
Leads: What happens when the syndicate's allocation is smaller than the total backing?
Each backer will be reduced pro rata.
Here's an example: Sara has a syndicate with 10 backers. Each of them back her for $10K, for a
total of $100K in backing. She personally invests $20K in a startup and asks for an additional
$100K for her backers. However, the startup is only able to allocate an additional $50K for her
backers. Because her total backing is larger than the additional allocation, each of her backers
would invest $5K instead of their usual $10K.
If a backer's reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the backer will
invest the minimum investment.
If the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will exercise judgment to
reduce backers' investment amounts for that deal—the lead will likely favor backers who have
expertise in the startup's markets and have large backing amounts.
Leads: Can my VC fund form a syndicate?
Yes. Individuals and VC funds can both form syndicates.
If a fund has its own LPs, the lead should check if their LP agreement allows them to form a
syndicate. If it does, any carry the lead collects from a syndicate can be distributed to the fund's
GPs, LPs or split between them.
Backers: What am I committing to when I back someone?
Backers agree to invest in their lead's syndicated deals, on the same terms as the lead. They also
pay the lead a carry.
Backers can stop backing a syndicate at any time—of course, all of the backer's existing
investments in the lead's deals remain intact when they stop backing.
Backers can also opt out of specific deals. Backers that consistently opt out of a syndicate's deals
may be removed by the lead. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 21 Backers: I've been accepted to a syndicate—what's next?
The next time your lead syndicates a deal, backers will be notified and given the opportunity to
opt out of converting their backing into a reservation. The syndicate lead will also provide their
investment rationale for the deal and disclose conflicts of interest. Later, backers will go through
a closing process and wire funds.
Backers: When do I get my profits?
When an exit opportunity arises, the lead will advise the fund when to sell the syndicates' shares.
If there are any profits, they are then distributed to the syndicate.
For example, if the company IPOs, the lead will decide when to sell the shares. If the company is
sold for cash, the lead will distribute any profits to the syndicate. There are many other situations
that are not considered here—in any case, the lead advises the fund when to sell.
The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by restrictions with the company and can only
sell shares in certain situations.
Backers: What is transparency?
Transparency allows syndicate leads to indicate whether they are syndicating all of their
investments (of $100K or more). Leads are not required to syndicate all of their investments and
their transparency is not a legally-binding agreement. They may also change their transparency
setting at any point in time.
Syndicates that are not sharing all of their investments may suffer from adverse selection, i.e.
leads may keep their best investments for themselves.
Backers: Can I change my investment amount in a particular deal?
Backers can increase or reduce their investment in a particular deal or opt out of a deal entirely.
The lead may also reduce a backer's investment in a particular deal if the syndicate's allocation is
oversubscribed.
Backers that consistently lower their investment amounts or frequently opt out of deals may be
removed by the syndicate lead.
Backers: Do I co-invest every time one of my leads invests in a company?
You co-invest only when a lead syndicates a deal—some leads don't syndicate all of their
investments.
Backers: What information rights do I receive?
Overall, the information that backers receive will not be as detailed as direct investors. On the
other hand, most companies will not accept small direct investments. If a backer is interested in
making a direct investment, she should get an introduction to the startup.
An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to backers when they
invest in a syndicated deal: This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:
MGMT 264: 001 Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial Management - Han (Spring 2016), University of Pennsylvania.
Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 22 1. Documents related to the fund's formation such as its operating agreement, PPM and
subscription agreement
2. Terms of the investment as well as templates of the documents that the fund signs, such as the
underlying investment documents (not including the company's schedule of investors)
3. Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is very high-level information
that is similar to what VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information
about the company's status with customers or financing. It will generally not include any
figures.
4. Any information investors need for their taxes (like K-1s) is distributed annually
Backers: What's a reservation?
Reservations are non-binding indications that an investor wants to invest in a company. When
one of your leads syndicates a deal, your backing is converted into a reservation in the company.
When there are enough reservations, investors will be invited to close.
Although reservations are non-binding commitments, backers who regularly opt out of deals or
do not follow through on their reservations may be removed from syndicates.
Backers: How is backing a syndicate different than investing in a VC fund?
Backing a lead and investing in a VC fund are complementary—syndicates are not intended to
replace VC funds. However, there are differences:
1. Backers get to pick a particular investor instead of an entire fund
2. Backers do not have a 10-year lockup on their funds
3. Backers can stop backing at any time
4. Leads typically personally invest more per deal than GPs Backers: Can investors outside the U.S. back syndicates?
Yes. Having a Tax Identification Number (TIN) is helpful but not required. Investors outside (or
inside) the U.S. should also get good tax advice when investing in startups.
Startups: Can my company be syndicated?
Your company must be a US-based C Corporation (preferably Delaware, California, or NY) and
have a syndicate lead.
Startups: Do I have to deal with a million new investors?
No. The lead and backers invest in a fund which then invests in the startup. Only the fund is
listed on the startup's cap table—the individual investors in the fund are not.
The fund is advised by the lead who signs documents and makes decisions for the fund. This document is authorized for use by Neha Budhraja, from 12/21/2015 to 5/15/2016, in the course:

Any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. AngelList: Changing the Landscape of Investing E520 p. 23 The overhead is equivalent to adding a single large investor to the round.
Startups: Do backers count towards my company's shareholder limit?
Probably. The lead and backers invest in a fund which then invests in the startup. The fund only
adds one new investor to the cap table. But the fund will likely be interpreted as a pass-through
entity for the purposes of counting shareholders.
Fortunately, the JOBS Act just lifted the shareholder limit for a company to stay private from
499 to 1,999.
Startups: How do I communicate with investors in my syndicate?
You can communicate with investors in your syndicate once the deal is closed by clicking the
"For Investors" tab on your startup profile and posting an update. You can add files, traction
information and rich text. Investors in your syndicate will receive a notification when you post
here.
Are syndicates legal?
AngelList has obtained No-Action Relief from the SEC, meaning that the SEC will not take
enforcement action against users of syndicates.

Is it legal to use AngelList to raise money?



Yes. Using AngelList to raise money is legal. It doesn't impose any more legal burdens on a startup than raising money offline. In fact, hundreds of startups have used AngelList to raise money. For more details, see the legal opinion that using AngelList is not a general solicitation and that AngelList is not a broker-dealer.

How do I use AngelList to raise money if my startup doesn't get featured?



First, fill in all of the sections of your startup profile with concise, compelling information. Browse around AngelList, especially noting the featured startups, to find good profiles and learn from them.Make sure you add all of your founders, employees, advisors, investors and so on. Your team members' followers get a feed update whenever a team member confirms a role.Make sure you add the $ amounts for all investors in your current round. $ amounts for specific investors are displayed only to the startup's contact person and that individual investor.Second, be proactive. Use search filters to find investors tagged with your startup's markets, in your location and that have invested in companies similar to yours. Use AngelList like a social network; follow people and companies, comment on posts and like others' updates.

If my company has pivoted, what should I do with my startup profile?



If you think your startup followers will want to know about the post-pivot startup, edit your existing profile. If not, start a new profile. For example, if the product and team are staying the same and you're just going after a different market, keep the profile. But if you're changing your product and market, and you've lost half of your co-founders, start a new profile. The case where you're keeping the team but changing the product and market is trickier — use your judgment. In either case, be sure to list the funding history of the company on the profile.

How can I delete a startup profile I created?



If your profile hasn't been published yet or is still in "Draft mode", you can delete it by going to "Edit" and choosing "Delete Startup Profile".  Similarly, if you are the only person connected to your startup, you can delete it in the same way.Each profile on AngelList can be connected to other founders, employees, advisors and investors. Removing one profile can remove important data from other profiles. We can't completely delete profiles from the site if they are connected to other users or profiles, but we will convert the profile to a "Community Profile" and remove some of the information you added when you created it.

How do I prevent investors from stealing my idea?



If you're obviously fund-able (e.g. you previously started a company that made lots of money for its investors), you might want to consider adding less information to your profile. If you're not obviously fund-able, consider the risk of sharing your idea to be a cost of doing business. If you're not willing to take this risk, don't use AngelList. Also, keep in mind that it is rare for someone to care enough about your idea to “steal” it.

What does Current and Previous Investors mean?



Current Investors are investors that are investing on the same terms as this round, whether right now or have in the past. Previous Investors are the others, i.e. those that invested on different terms to those currently offered.An investor does not have to have sent money or signed docs to be listed as Current, they just have to be committed to invest in the round and confirm the tagging.

No recruiters or contingency posts. Don't post jobs, apply to jobs, or contact candidates on behalf of other companies.Be fair and accurate. Jobs must list real compensation for currently open positions at active companies—nothing contingent on future funding.  No concealing company information. Candidates must accurately represent their work history. We may remove your profile or request more information if we can't verify the information you've entered.Be professional. Treat candidates and companies with respect.Violators will be permanently banned. More details are in our Terms of Service.

Candidates & Employers: What is a match and what do I do next?



AngelList is a double opt in. A company says "Yes" to a candidate or vice versa and then the other party is sent a notification. The other party then has the option to respond. If they're interested and click "Yes" again, then a match is made. The company/candidate will be found under the Matches tab and an introduction email is sent to both parties to facilitate communication between them.Once that happens, either party can reply to the email and it will go to the candidate or the recruiter from the company.

Public Fundraising





If I raise on AngelList is it public / general solicitation?



No. Almost all deals on AngelList are private to accredited investors only. This means that they fall under the 506(b) regime and are not public fundraising under Reg A or general solicitation under 506(c). However, companies can elect to raise under general solicitation if they wish.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








What is public fundraising?



Public fundraising allows startups tell the general public they're raising money—on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, TV, advertisements, etc. The legal term for public fundraising is ‘general solicitation’.Whether startups raise money publicly or not, they can only accept money from accredited investors. Startups that raise publicly also have the legal burden of verifying that their investors are accredited. If a startup that raised publicly closes their round on AngelList (via syndicates), AngelList will handle all 506c investor verification. 

Link to this
·
Updated Sep 17, 2015








Does AngelList support public fundraising?



Adding your startup or funding round to AngelList doesn't affect whether you are raising publicly or privately. Fundraising activity on AngelList is only visible to logged in, accredited investors.If you announce your raise publicly (for example, by social media or to your company's newsletter), you will need to collect evidence from all investors to verify their accredited investor status.If you close the round on AngelList (via syndicates), AngelList will provide accreditation verification for all investors in your round, free of charge. If you close your round offline, your investors can still get verified for free by AngelList, and can provide our verification letter to you or your company counsel at closing to satisfy the SEC's requirements.

·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








Should I fundraise publicly?



Good question. Public fundraising can be useful for companies with a customer base of accredited investors (e.g. service for physicians) or for companies with a large social media reach. However, startups should be aware that enabling public fundraising will make it easier for press to disclose details about their fundraising efforts. Also, verifying that all investors are accredited takes time and effort, and may discourage some investors from participating in the deal.

Link to this
·
Updated Sep 17, 2015








What if I don't want to fundraise publicly?



By default, startup fundraising information is just available to investors. This prevents the general public from seeing fundraising information.To avoid triggering the requirements of general solicitation, don't promote your raise publicly, and ask your employees, investors and advisors to refrain from public discussion also.

Can I raise money from unaccredited investors to crowdfund my startup?

Can non-U.S. companies raise money publicly?

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








What regulations do I need to follow if I fundraise publicly?



When you raise money publicly, you must have a higher standard for accreditation verification: you must take ‘reasonable steps’ to verify that your investors are  accredited. For example, your investor could provide an income tax form. It is not enough for your investors to merely swear that they are accredited. Fortunately, AngelList will do the work of collecting the evidence that your investors meet this higher standard.If you choose not to fundraise publicly, you can meet a lower standard of having a ‘reasonable belief’ that your investors are accredited. Historically, investors have sworn they are accredited in this case—although the SEC has stated that may not be enough.Also see What kind of statements can I make about publicly fundraising companies?.

How should the press write about startups raising funds on AngelList?



If you are covering a startup that is fundraising on AngelList, you should avoid writing about financing details for companies that are not publicly raising money – also known as general solicitation. If you do write about them – even by mistake – it can cause them legal problems due to SEC regulations. Here's how to steer clear of trouble.It is okay to write about company fundraising details on AngelList if:
The company name and details are visible on Invest Online while you are logged out of AngelListThe company's AngelList profile page shows a green "Public" tag, like this company, under the Fundraising sectionThe company can be found in this filtered Companies listAll of the above are visible without being signed in to an AngelList account – in fact, this is how you should browse, since all you will be able to see is publicly available info.If they're not meeting any of the conditions above, don't discuss or publicize their fundraising details. Only a small percentage of companies on AngelList have chosen to fundraise publicly. Unfortunately, doing so causes them to bear a lot of extra expense (and potentially lose investors) due to the need to collect a lot more information from potential investors. Publishing information about private companies would "break the seal" – automatically making them operate under the SEC’s 506c rule, which covers general solicitation.Also: if you attempt to pose as an investor in order to get access to info about companies that are raising privately, we will permanently ban you from AngelList.

Accreditation Reports





What is an accredited investor?



Accredited investors meet standards defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which allow them to invest in certain private securities offerings. Most startups raising money do so from accredited investors only.The SEC web site contains the full definition. In general, any of the following would meet the standard:• Individuals with annual income over $200K (individually) or $300K (with spouse) over the last 2 years and an expectation of the same this year• Individuals with net assets over $1 million, excluding the primary residence (unless more is owed on the mortgage than the residence is worth)• An institution with over $5 million in assets, such as a venture fund or a trust• An entity made up entirely of accredited investors

·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








Why do I need to show that I'm an accredited investor?



As of September 2013, the SEC requires companies that publicly discuss their financing to take reasonable steps to verify that investors are accredited. Simply stating that you are accredited, as investors did prior to September 2013, is not considered enough.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








Why is a credit report necessary?



If you claim that you are an accredited investor because you have over $1 million in net assets, then the company you are investing in is required to verify your debts as well. AngelList requests this credit report and includes only total debts (excluding mortgages) in your Accreditation Report.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








What do I need to provide to prove that I am an accredited investor?



If you are accredited based on income, you will need to provide documentation of income for the past 2 years. This can be in the form of tax returns, W2s or other official documents. This is usually the fastest way to get accredited.If you are accredited based on assets, you can provide recent brokerage statements clearly showing your name, the date and the value of your account(s). We will also pull your credit report and deduct any non-mortgage debts shown from the value of your assets to arrive at net assets.You can also provide a recent letter from a reviewer like a CPA, attorney, investment advisor or investment broker. Our accreditation verification process will allow you to trigger an email to your reviewer using acceptable language.

How long does an Accreditation Report remain valid?



You must swear you are still accredited each time you generate a link to share the report.However, the proof only needs to be updated periodically. How often depends on what the investment entity is (individual, firm, trust) and what you use to prove your status: income or assets.• Income proof can be used until April 15th of the year following its verification• Asset proof can be used for 3 months• All other cases, such as proof of a trust's accreditation through the accreditation of its entire individual membership, are currently limited to 3 monthsThese durations drive the green-colored "valid until" date you will see on every Accreditation Report. Once expired, updated proof will have to be presented to set a new validity date, but the Accreditation Report will remain publicly viewable.

Does an Accreditation Report constitute "reasonable steps to verify" accredited status?



We have worked very hard to match the evidence we collect to the standards contained in the SEC's regulations, but we do not make any guarantees.Lawyers will make their own determination based on the company and as not all circumstances are identical. So far, companies represented by Cooley, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Gunderson Dettmer, and many other firms have accepted investments based on this evidence.

Syndicates





What is a syndicate?



A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry.Here's an example: Sara, a notable angel investor, decides to lead a syndicate. The syndicate investors agree to invest $200K total in each of her future deals and pay her 15% carry.When Sara makes her next investment, she offers to invest $250K in the company. She personally invests $50K and offers the remaining $200K to her syndicate.If the investment is successful, the syndicate investors first receive their $200K, after which every dollar of the syndicate’s profit is split 80% to the syndicate investors, 15% to Sara and 5% to AngelList Advisors.  AngelList Advisors is a venture capital exempt reporting advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a subsidiary of AngelList.View syndicates »

What are the benefits of syndicates?



Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments.

How much do syndicates cost?



Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList Advisors.Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each deal—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList or AngelList Advisors does not profit from these fees.The lead and AngelList Advisors do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

What is the legal structure of a syndicate?



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically to invest in the company.  The fund is formed as a series LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors.The lead usually does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders.

What is carry?



Carry is a share of the profit of an investment that is paid to the managers of the investment. It is short for ‘carried interest’.In a VC fund, the limited partners of the fund pay carry to the general partners if the entire fund is profitable. This is called fund carry or net carry.In syndicates, investors pay carry to the lead for any profitable investment. This is called deal carry. Syndicates use deal carry so investors can opt out of any investment or stop investing anytime.Learn more about carry and the economics of

Syndicates receive pro rata rights if the lead negotiates them with the startup.  If a syndicate has pro rata rights, syndicate investors in the initial round may have the opportunity to invest their pro rata allocation in subsequent financings. Any remaining allocation may be offered to other investors or funds.  The pro rata may not be offered to syndicate investors if the lead does not participate, if it is unlikely that a reasonable amount of the pro rata will be filled, or for other reasons. Pro rata rights vary in strength and enforceability. Pro rata rights may be waivable by a majority of investors in the round or waived as a condition to a new financing round.

Leads: What is minimum I have to invest in each deal?



The minimum investment for a lead who is investing her own money is generally 2.5% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors. The minimum investment for a lead who is investing out of a fund raised from limited partners is generally 20% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors.This minimum only applies to capital raised from individuals. Syndicates can raise an unlimited amount of capital from institutional investors such as platform funds.For example, if a lead puts $5K of her own money in a startup, she can raise an additional $195K from individual investors in her syndicate. She can also raise an unlimited amount of capital from a platform fund like CSC Upshot.The minimum investment may be reduced if a notable investor is making a significant investment in the round. It may also be reduced in pro ratas and other special situations. Investors in the syndicate will be notified if the minimum is reduced.Investors can also view the lead's investment amount in any deal and opt out of the deal, for any reason.Learn more

Leads: What happens if my allocation in a deal is smaller than my syndicate?



Each investor’s commitment will be reduced pro rata if your allocation is smaller than the total commitments from syndicate investors. Here's an example. Sara has a syndicate with 10 accepted investors. Each investor has committed $10K to the syndicate, for a total of $100K. Sara personally invests $20K in the deal and asks for an additional $100K for her syndicate. However, the startup is only able to allocate $50K to the syndicate. So each of her syndicate investors will invest $5K instead of the $10K they requested.If an investor‘s reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the investor will invest the minimum investment. In this case, if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will use her judgment to reduce investors’ amounts for that deal. The lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the company‘s markets or have large investment amounts.In some deals, a maximum may be placed on aggregate commitments by the platform funds.

Leads: Should I negotiate for pro rata rights?



Yes. Pro rata rights are important for AngelList and syndicate leads to invest additional capital in winning investments and generate larger returns.

Leads: What is the lead's carry in a pro rata?



The lead's carry in a pro rata is the same as the initial round, as long as her investment is greater than or equal to either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller.The lead's carry in a pro rata will be reduced by 5% if her investment is less than either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller. AngelList Advisors, the fund's investment adviser, will receive this additional carry in addition to its usual 5% carry. This is due to  the added work and risk, and since AngelList Advisors is less able to look to the lead’s decision when advising the fund.In both cases, if the lead does not provide access to the pro rata and provide relevant information, she will not earn any carry and AngelList will receive a total of 10% carry.

Leads: What should I name my syndicate?



Most leads use their full name for their syndicate because they expect investors to join the syndicate on the basis of their personal reputation.If you are investing on behalf of a firm or if you focus on a specific type of investment, you may wish to choose a different name for your syndicate.Investors should be able to clearly tell who is running the syndicate from the syndicate's name. The name should also not be generic or contain the word ‘syndicate’.“FG Angels” is a good name for a syndicate. “Angel” is not.“Hardware Investments by Vinod Khosla” is a good name for a syndicate. “The Hardware Syndicate” is not.

Leads: Limitations on syndicate investments in certain foreign companies (PFIC & CFC)




Investments in certain types of foreign companies ares subject to disadvantaged tax treatment and  ongoing compliance requirements. 
These rules are complicated, but if the investment is in a foreign holding company it may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)  and if the investment is in a foreign company that is majority owned by US taxpayers, it may be a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). 
As a result of the added tax and  compliance burdens, AngelList does not generally facilitate investment in either PFIC's or CFC's. When a syndicate makes an investment in a non-US company, the company will be asked to certify that it is neither a PFIC nor a CFC and agree to ongoing compliance requirements. 
 A lead should confirm the PFIC / CFC status with a foreign company early on to avoid wasted efforts. Any investment in a company that cannot certify to being a non-PFIC / CFC will either not be facilitated on AngelList or will require additional disclosures and approvals from AngelList.

Investors: Why isn't there a higher minimum investment for leads?



Raising the minimum investment would cause some leads to stop syndicating their investments. Instead, they would start or join venture capital funds, which typically have no minimums.The
partners of a VC fund typically provide 1-5% of the fund's capital, but
also take out 15-25% in management fees. In
effect, they don't make a contribution to the fund. The minimum for leads investing their own money in a syndicate is 2.5%. And the minimum for leads investing out of a fund is 20%. Except in rare cases, leads receive no management fees from the syndicate. So, for the vast
majority of leads, syndicates are already more expensive than venture capital
funds. Raising the minimum would cause some leads to stop syndicating their
investments. They would instead invest through a venture capital fund.

Raising the minimum would also cause some leads who are new to investing to stop altogether, because it is already a significant portion of their net worth. This would lead to less diversity of investment opportunities from new leads.Investors who are unhappy with a lead's contribution can always opt out of an investment. They can also invest in AngelList Funds, which make investment decisions on behalf of investors, for no additional cost or carry.Learn more about the economics of syndicates.

Investors: What are the tax consequences of investing in a syndicate?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members of a special-purpose fund formed to make the investment. That fund will purchase preferred shares, convertible debt or other instruments issued by the company.  Certain taxable events may result in income or losses flowing through the special-purpose fund to its investors.  Investors with taxable income or loss will receive K-1s.If the fund holds an equity interest in a portfolio company, there is a taxable event on exits or when the company is dissolved or files for bankruptcy. In rare instances, there may also be a taxable event if the fund receives a dividend or distribution.  If the fund purchases convertible debt, prior to conversion into equity, there may be a tax consequence for your portion of the interest on the debt or in connection with the cancellation of debt such as in a bankruptcy.

Investors: What are the tax consequences for non-U.S. investors in syndicates?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members in a special-purpose vehicle, structured as a US series LLC. Each syndicate will typically send out IRS Forms K-1 to all its members, both foreign and domestic, in any year in which it has taxable income or deductible expenses. We understand from informal consultation with tax counsel that, generally, income and distributions from AngelList syndicated deals to non-US investors without substantial US business involvement are exempt from US tax and withholding requirements, provided that such investors have submitted the appropriate FATCA Related Forms.

Investors: What is a management fee?



A management fee is a quarterly or annual fee added onto a deal, meant to compensate the lead for their time and expenses. Leads may charge management fees for hiring employees, maintaining an office, paying salaries, etc. This is similar to how venture capital firms operate. However, in the case of an AngelList syndicate, because investors can opt in or out on each deal, all economics (including management fees) are calculated on a deal-by-deal basis.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees work?



For each deal, the lifetime total management fee (ex. 3%) is collected upfront and drawn down by the lead over time (ex. 0.25% quarterly, for three years). If there's an exit before the entire management fee is drawn, undrawn capital is returned to investors. If there's a profitable exit, the lead must return the entire amount raised (including the management fee) before earning any carried interest.

Investors: How do management fees benefit investors?



Management fees allow leads to hire staff, maintain offices, and be competitive with venture capital firms that have fees at their disposal. Many of the world's top investors are VC General Partners. By introducing management fees, AngelList is better equipped to support this cohort of investors and attract them to share their deals online.Over time, many of the current syndicate leads will face financial pressure to start or join venture capital firms where they can earn fees to offset their costs. They may choose this instead of syndicating. Management fees help mitigate this financial pressure and retain leads on the AngelList platform.

Investors: How do I know which deals charge management fees?

Taxes: I'm foreign, do I need to file a return?



As an investor in the fund, we are required to send you a K-1 from the fund when it has a filing requirement. We also send the information to the IRS. Whether or not you need to file a US tax return depends on many factors. Since we are not tax advisors, we suggest that you contact a CPA or tax attorney who can give you personalized guidance.

Updated Mar 13








Taxes: Why does my K-1 show income/I never received this income?





OID Interest: Under current tax regulations, convertible notes are considered to be a type of OID (Original Issue Discount) instrument.  Internal Revenue Code section 1272 requires holders of OID instruments to recognize interest income every year despite no interest being actually paid out. This requirement remains in effect whether the note holder uses the cash or the accrual method of accounting.

Conversion: During the year, the convertible note held by a fund converted into shares of the portfolio company. At the time of conversion, rather than paying cash for the interest accrued, the company issued additional shares to the fund. Because the fund recognized this increase in value, the tax code considers this taxable income and requires that it be passed through to the fund's investors.

LLC Passthrough: Say Fund X invests into Company Z, which is a partnership/LLC. Under the tax code, partnerships/LLCs do not pay their own tax. The income or loss of the partnership/LLC is passed through to partners/members who recognize their portion of that income/loss on their own returns. Although Company Z had a profit for the year, they have not made any distributions, but have instead reinvested that profit back into the company. Despite not receiving any cash, investors are still required to include that income in their individual tax returns.

However, if additional time is required to file an accurate return, an extension of time to file may be granted. Once an extension has been filed, the deadline becomes September 15. By virtue of the unavailability of certain required information, this was the earliest we were able to issue the K-1s.

AngelList Funds are a convenient way for accredited investors to build a diversified portfolio of startups.  One up-front investment gets you exposure to each fund's target number of startups. AngelList Advisors (an AngelList entity) invests each fund's capital in select syndicated deals on AngelList. We return capital when any company in which the fund invests exits. This is not like a traditional VC fund with professional, compensated GPs; this is a no-fee fund of funds that broadly invests in syndicates on AngelList. This is suited to investors taking a diversified approach to investing rather than picking individual companies or syndicates.

Each fund will aim to invest at least $20K in a deal, but generally not more than 10% of the total amount syndicated in each deal to avoid concentration in any one deal and comply with securities laws.

In how many deals will each fund invest?

Are there management fees or costs?



AngelList
Funds do not charge any management fees.A small portion
of the capital will be used to cover the out-of-pocket costs of setting up and
administering each fund over its lifetime. Each individual investment also has
out-of-pocket costs (and in rare cases a management fee payable to a lead) that are covered pro rata by the
investors, which will include the fund.The total
out-of-pocket costs for each fund are estimated to be $50,000 or more.

Will carry be charged?



AngelList Funds do not charge a carry. However, each individual investment charges carry. A typical carry for an individual investment is 20%. 15% of that carry goes to the lead investor of the syndicate and 5% goes to AngelList.

Can I sell my stake and get out early? 



You may not sell your stake or otherwise transfer your interest outside of serious events like death or divorce. Startup investments are highly risky and illiquid.

·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








How long do funds last?



The investment period depends on the amount of deals and follow-ons done by the Fund, and the amount per deal. We currently estimate that it may take 2 or more years to invest $5M.Thereafter, the fund will continue to hold the investments until each position has been exited, liquidated or closed, and realized net profits, if any, have been distributed to investors. We estimate that this may take up to 8 years, or more.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








Can I opt out of individual investments? Can I invest more in an individual company?



You can't opt out of an individual investment. You can invest more in specific companies by clicking the Invest button on that company's profile, where available.

How will I find out what each fund invests in? 



We will disclose fund investments to fund investors after they are finalized.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








Will the funds exercise pro-rata rights? 



Funds may exercise pro-rata rights to make follow-on investments in deals where there is a VC firm leading the round, the valuation is higher than the previous round, the total amount raised is higher than the previous round and/or there are new investors in the company.

·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








What reporting will funds do?



Funds will disclose fund investments after they are finalized, and may provide qualitative updates to investors when available. Funds will not post audited financial statements. Funds will not mark valuations to market each year given the extreme difficulty of doing that in an accurate manner for early stage investments.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 12, 2015








Will fund investments appear on my profile?



No, just funds you invest in will appear in the Portfolio section of your profile because your investment is in the fund, not directly in the company.

Updated Aug 12, 2015








How will AngelList handle fund distributions?



We plan to distribute proceeds from any exits as we receive them but may bundle distributions together to reduce administrative costs.We plan to distribute any public company stock and cash received as it is received. We may distribute stock or cash on a quarterly basis if the volume of receipts is very high. We plan to hold private company stock until it is liquid.

Brad Feld: The 99 Investor Problem
 Tweet3 Share Share +1 Reddit Pin EmailShares 3

January 24, 2014 @ 10:18 am By Brad Feld 


Brad Feld is a venture capitalist with the Foundry Group in Boulder, Colorado. He invests in software and Internet companies around the United States. The following post was shared with permission.
When the JOBS Act was finalized, one of the rule changes that had a lot of fanfare around it was the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have. Prior to the JOBS Act, it was 500, after which point the company had to register and report to the SEC just like it was a public company (even if it hadn’t gone public.) This was a major issue for many fast growing companies that either went through strange contortions not to have 500 investors, or filed with the SEC to get no-action letters. There were plenty of nuances around this rule and I was in the middle of several situations that structured around it legally. Each time it was a lot of overhead for the company in question, none of which added anything to the system except fees to the lawyers.
Lifting the number of investors to 2000 seemed to make sense. In the situations I was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem. So that’s good.
But ever since we started working with AngelList on FG Angels, we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the 99 Investor Problem. We structure our investment in companies via an LLC that has all the individual FG Angels syndicate members in it. This simplifies life for the company as they only end up with 1 investor – the FG Angels syndicate LCC – rather than a bunch of individual investors. At this point we have 217 backers in our syndicate, so with us each company would end up having 218 separate investors if we didn’t use the LLC.
If everyone was on the cap table, the company would have to chase down 218 signatures for everything. Instead, using our approach, they have effectively two investors – our FG Angels syndicate (one investor) and Foundry Group (another investor). Two signatures. Much easier. We handle the Foundry Group signature. AngelList handles the syndicate signature.
Except it doesn’t work that way. The SEC limits an LLC to having 99 investors. So we can only have 99 of the 217 syndicate members participate. Now, there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” (QPs) – individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets – from the 99 investor count. Overall our QPs + the top 99 investors in our syndicate represent $321,000 based on committed amounts to FG Angels. If you include the balance of the 237 members, we end up at a syndicate of $439,000. The company then gets our commitment of $50,000 on top of that.
As a result of this 99 investor limitation, we have two disappointing problems. First, we have over 100 investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the 99 investor rule. Next, there is $118,000 per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get. Bad for the companies and bad for the investor.
We’ve spent lots of time over the past 60 days trying to solve the 99 investor problem. At this point, we’ve run into a dead end. We’ve tried multiple LLCs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity. We’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work. We’re certainly open to ideas at this point.
In the mean time, until we solve this, AngelList is making the following changes to their Syndicates product.
– Qualified Purchasers: AngelList will include all Qualified Purchasers (individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets) in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the SEC’s 99-investor limit. We will soon email your backers to determine if they are Qualified Purchasers (QPs) and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the QPs.
– Top 99 Backers: The next time you syndicate a deal, we will include all QPs and the top 99 non-QPs by commitment amount. You can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top 99. The top 99 backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts.
– Funds: We are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top 99 backers or QPs to participate in your syndicated deals.
– Notifying Backers: Finally, we will notify your backers of the SEC’s 99-investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts.
We are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the FG Angels activity. The 99 investor rule directly undermines this, and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in. It’s another example of the challenges of the JOBS Act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation.

Mr. Feld
Do you have any reccomendations for those of us working on intrastate exemptions on how to battle the 99 investor problem with in state legislation? Do you have any reccomendations of who else I could talk to about possible intrastate solutions here in Colorado.
