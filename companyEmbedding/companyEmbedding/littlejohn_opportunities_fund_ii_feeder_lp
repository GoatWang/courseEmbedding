Littlejohn & Co. Announces Final Close of $650 million Fund III
May 4, 2005

GREENWICH, CT, May 4, 2005 --
Littlejohn & Co., a private investment firm that applies an
operational approach to building middle market companies, today
announced that it has completed the final closing of Littlejohn
Fund III, L.P. with capital commitments of $650 million. The firm
was targeting $600 million in limited partner commitments, but
placed a hard cap of $650 million on Fund III after finding itself
significantly oversubscribed.
Littlejohn Fund III is the firm's
largest fund to date, and together with two other funds raised
since inception in 1996, aggregates a total of approximately $1.4
billion of capital under management. Littlejohn will continue to
implement its operationally oriented investment approach as with
its two predecessor funds and target companies that are
underperforming their potential due to the lack of management
resources, capital or experiencing market changes.
"We are extremely pleased with the
overwhelming success of our fundraising effort to have exceeded our
expectations," said Angus Littlejohn, Chairman and CEO of
Littlejohn & Co. "We are gratified by the market's response and
to have completed a very quick fund raising process largely based
on the strength of our existing associations. Our Fund has the
representation of investors from around the world who see value in
our ability to develop businesses through operational enhancements
and our team remains focused on the opportunities where we can add
value."
Investors in existing and past
Littlejohn funds have included some of the leading public and
corporate pension funds, endowments, and domestic and foreign
insurance companies and fund of funds. The firm's marketing of Fund
III was limited to existing Fund II investors as well as investors
with which it had longstanding communications. Littlejohn did not
use a placement agent in the marketing of Fund III. Littlejohn
closed on its inaugural fund, the Littlejohn Direct Investment
Program, in 1997 with $205 million in commitments. The second,
Littlejohn Fund II, LP was closed in 2000 with committed capital of
$530 million from limited partners.
"We made tremendous progress last
year in enhancing the operations of our portfolio investments,"
said Michael Klein, President of Littlejohn. "We have been
successful at building stand alone companies from corporate spin
offs and believe that there are additional investment opportunities
for us as restructuring continues both in the U.S. and Europe."
In addition to Angus Littlejohn and
Michael Klein, the Littlejohn team includes two other partners;
Edmund Feeley and Brian Ramsay, as well as eight additional
investment professionals. Among the firm's more recent investments
is the acquisition of the Aeronautics business of General dynamics
by Littlejohn's portfolio company Wyle Laboratories.
About Littlejohn & Co LLC
Founded in 1996, Littlejohn &
Co., LLC is a private equity firm that makes control equity
investments in mid-sized companies that can benefit from its
operational and strategic approach. The firm is based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. Littlejohn can be reached at 203-552-3500.

Credit Opportunities  /  Special Situations






Credit Opportunities

OverviewStrategyApproachInvestment CharacteristicsFund Info









Overview


The Credit Opportunities strategy focuses on long-term investing in the stressed and distressed debt of Lower Middle Market companies.Key components of the strategy include:
















Capitalizing on the inherent inefficiencies in the lower middle and distressed debt markets
Sourcing underfollowed opportunities within our circle of expertise




Leveraging our team's extensive experience and longstanding relationships
Investing in the debt securities at a significant discount




Providing capital and resources to improve the balance sheet

Creating value by providing operational expertise and resources














Strategy


The Credit Opportunities strategy seeks to generate long-term value and equity-like returns through opportunistic investments in the stressed and distressed debt securities of U.S. Lower Middle Market companies.


Courage seeks to construct a diversified portfolio of investments at discounted enterprise values (3.5x to 5.5x EBITDA) versus typical private equity sponsor transaction multiples (7x to 11x EBITDA).  Through its strategy of purchasing discounted debt in the secondary market, Courage seeks to generate equity-like returns with downside protection.Courage seeks to support senior management in developing and executing a business plan designed to maximize enterprise value. Courage may sit on company boards and deploy its operating partners when appropriate.








Approach
Downside Protection & Capital Preservation


The strategy employs a deep-value approach to investing with a long-term investment horizon and an emphasis on downside protection. Courage focuses on the less competitive, more inefficient Lower Middle Market segment.
The strategy provides current income and  downside protection consistent with credit investing yet offers significant upside potential typical of private equity strategies.The team’s substantial financial, restructuring, operational and industry expertise, coupled with its ability to source unique opportunities has enabled Courage to generate attractive investment returns through multiple market cycles.
