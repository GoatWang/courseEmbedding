Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) Cut to “Sell” at Zacks Investment Research


					Posted by Joanna Charbonneau on Jul 20th, 2017 // No Comments




Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a report issued on Thursday. 
According to Zacks, “Coty’s shares have underperformed the Cosmetics & Toiletries industry in the last one year. We note that the consumer beauty segment have been witnessing sluggish results since past many quarters. Though the acquisitions of the P&G Beauty Business, Younique and the Hypermarcas Brands drove consumer beauty segment’s sales by more than 100% in the third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, organically, sales have declined 6%, primarily reflecting a negative price and mix impact. Declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the U.S. and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the U.S. are expected to continue to negatively impact business. While the company has a strong portfolio of brands and keeps innovating products to boost its sales, increasing competitive pressure, currency headwinds and changing consumer preferences have been the major deterrents for the company.”
