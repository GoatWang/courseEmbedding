Coursey, Gary B.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Dakota:













Does Coursey, Gary B carry a valid contracting license?



North Dakota requires contractors to be licensed for any residential construction work of $2000 and up. 
Coursey, Gary B currently holds license 2196 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Dakota?



North Dakota does not require contractors to take an exam before obtaining a license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Coursey, Gary B



In North Dakota, licensed contractors must carry an active workers' compensation policy as well as general liability insurance. Request a current certificate of insurance for both general liability and workers' compensation before any work begins. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Dakota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
