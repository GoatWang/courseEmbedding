Early life and education[edit]
James L. Gallogly was born January 1, 1953 in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, one of ten children of Tom and Margery Gallogly. He attended high school at Wasson High School in Colorado Springs.[6]
He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1977. He completed the Advanced Executive Program at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in 1998.[3]

He was appointed vice president of plastics (1996),[7] vice president of olefins and polyolefins (1998) and later senior vice president of chemicals and plastics (1999).[8]
Gallogly has held executive positions with ConocoPhillips, ChevronPhillips and Phillips Petroleum. Phillips Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. combined to form Chevron Phillips Chemical as a joint venture in June 2000. Gallogly became the inaugural president and chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips Chemical, one of the world's top producers of olefins and polyolefins, remaining there until 2006.[1]
In 2002, Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum merged to form ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, Texas.[9] In 2006, Gallogly joined ConocoPhillips as executive vice president of refining, marketing and transportation and later as executive vice president of exploration and production.[1]
Gallogly became the chief executive officer of LyondellBasell in Houston, Texas in 2009, succeeding Volker Trautz as part of a reorganization following U.S. bankruptcy court proceedings. Gallogly guided the company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and successfully repositioned it as one of the world's largest refining companies and makers of polymers and petrochemicals.[1][2][10]
Gallogly formally retired as CEO of LyondellBasell in January 2015.[4] As of February 5, 2015, he was appointed as a director of DuPont[5]

DuPont Appoints Edward D. Breen and James L. Gallogly to Board of Directors 

	2.5.15







Current DuPont Directors Curtis J. Crawford and Richard H. Brown to Serve Important Roles on Board of Chemours

WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. 5, 2015 – DuPont (NYSE: DD) today announced that it has appointed Edward D. Breen and James L. Gallogly as independent Directors to its Board, effective immediately.

The appointments of Mr. Breen and Mr. Gallogly have been made in anticipation of two current DuPont directors, Curtis J. Crawford and Richard H. Brown, transitioning off of the DuPont Board to serve initially as consultants to The Chemours Company (“Chemours”), and then as directors of Chemours upon completion of its separation from DuPont. Upon separation, Mr. Brown will serve as non-executive chairman of Chemours. 










DuPont Chair and Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman said, “We thank Curt and Dick for their years of important contributions to DuPont’s Board.  They have brought valuable business insight and deep leadership and board experience that have helped contribute to the ongoing transformation of DuPont.  Both Curt and Dick have been great colleagues and strong forces for progress.  We know they will serve the Chemours Board with distinction, bringing that same drive and focus to help the management of Chemours attain their goals.”
“Ed and Jim will bring their deep expertise and business acumen to an already highly distinguished DuPont Board as we continue the transformation of the company to deliver strong, sustainable growth and shareholder value,” said Kullman. “Both Ed and Jim are well-known for their outstanding records of performance and we are looking forward to adding their perspectives and experience to the change initiatives under way to deliver the next great era of innovation-driven growth at DuPont.”
Mr. Breen led the revival of Tyco and over the course of his tenure, oversaw the repayment of over $20 billion in debt and delivered 703 percent total return to shareholders, significantly outperforming the 215 percent total return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Mr. Gallogly took over the reins of LyondellBasell shortly after the company filed for Chapter 11 protection. Through a focus on operational excellence and highly effective cost management, Mr. Gallogly guided the company out of bankruptcy within a year and upon relisting, delivered a 593 percent total return to shareholders, before announcing his retirement, relative to the 82 percent total return of the S&P 500 over the same period.
Mr. Breen said, “DuPont is a company with strong corporate governance practices and a world-class Board comprised of proven leaders across global industries. I am excited about joining this Board, which has demonstrated active oversight of a strategy that is delivering results and positioning the company for future success. I look forward to bringing my experience to DuPont and am confident in the company’s prospects for continued success and value creation.”
Mr. Gallogly added, “I am honored to join the Board of Directors of DuPont, an iconic American company with a 200-year history of science and innovation. This is a critical and exciting time at DuPont, as the company continues to transform its portfolio and execute its comprehensive realignment. I look forward to working with my fellow directors and the management team to oversee the execution of these initiatives and to drive growth and generate value for all of the Company’s shareholders.”
About Edward D. Breen
Mr. Breen (age 58) currently serves as chairman of the Board of Directors of Tyco International plc (“Tyco”). As chairman and CEO from July 2002 until September 2012, Mr. Breen oversaw the design and implementation of the comprehensive action plan to transform Tyco into the strong market leader it is today, reviving the company from near bankruptcy and rebuilding the company’s brand and credibility.

LyondellBasell Names Jim Gallogly as CEO













LyondellBasell Names Jim Gallogly as CEO
May 14, 2009









HOUSTON, May 14 /PRNewswire/ -- LyondellBasell Industries today announced that its Supervisory Board has named James L. (Jim) Gallogly chief executive officer, effective immediately. Gallogly will succeed Volker Trautz who has announced his retirement from the company. The terms of the appointment are subject to the approval of the U.S. bankruptcy court overseeing LyondellBasell's reorganization plan.
"Jim is a highly respected executive in the polymers, chemicals and fuels industries and experienced in successfully navigating the cyclical challenges of these businesses," said Len Blavatnik, Chairman of LyondellBasell's Supervisory Board. "His impressive record in the industry, combined with years of international experience, makes him the right person to head LyondellBasell and to fully realize the company's potential," Blavatnik said.
"I am pleased to welcome Jim to LyondellBasell," said Trautz. "I have known him for many years, and I am confident that he will successfully guide the company as it reaffirms its leadership position in the chemical industry."
Gallogly commented: "LyondellBasell has an extremely capable management team and a sound strategy for advancing the company in the years to come. My role will be to harness the initiatives that are currently in motion, and manage the business and operations as we successfully transition out of Chapter 11 near year end.
"LyondellBasell boasts a heritage of innovation and excellence and a global footprint that makes it one of the elite participants in the chemicals and polymers markets. I believe in LyondellBasell's long-term potential, and I have the highest admiration for the people at all levels of the company who have executed well in recent months under extremely challenging conditions. I look forward to working with the leadership team to deliver value to our customers, employees, creditors and investors," Gallogly said.
Gallogly already has met with a number of the company's stakeholders and shared his vision for the company. Earlier this year, LyondellBasell voluntarily filed to reorganize its U.S. operations and certain European holding companies in order to restructure the company's debts and reposition operations for future growth.
Gallogly comes to LyondellBasell from ConocoPhillips where he served as executive vice president of exploration & production, and before that as executive vice president of refining, marketing and transportation. From 2000 to 2006, he was president and chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, one of the world's top producers of olefins and polyolefins. Gallogly began his career with Phillips Petroleum Company in 1980, serving in a variety of legal, finance and operational roles including two assignments in Stavanger, Norway. He also served as vice president of plastics and later senior vice president of chemicals.
Gallogly serves on the board of directors of the American Petroleum Institute. He previously served on the boards of the American Chemistry Council, the American Plastics Council and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.
He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Colorado in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1977. He completed the Advanced Executive Program at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in 1998.
Gallogly was born in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. He currently resides in Houston.

HOUSTON and LONDON, Sept. 29, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- LyondellBasell (NYSE:   LYB) announced today that Chief Executive Officer James L. Gallogly will retire from the company in early 2015.  Gallogly will continue to serve as CEO and chairman of the LyondellBasell management board in the interim to ensure an orderly transition pending the selection of his replacement.  The LyondellBasell supervisory board of directors has formed a committee to choose Gallogly's successor.   
In May 2014, shareholders approved the expansion of the company's management board, chaired by Gallogly, to include Craig B. Glidden, executive vice president and chief legal officer, Karyn F. Ovelmen, executive vice president and  chief financial officer, Bhavesh (Bob) V. Patel, executive vice president – Olefins & Polyolefins - EAI and Technology,  Timothy D. Roberts, executive vice president – Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas, and Patrick D. Quarles, senior vice president – Intermediates and Derivatives. The management board members were elected to four-year terms to ensure continued strong leadership and executive continuity at the company. "The entire management board has demonstrated exceptional business leadership and I am confident the transition will be seamless," Gallogly said. 
"Under Jim's leadership, LyondellBasell successfully emerged from bankruptcy in record time and today is an industry leader with a very strong balance sheet and strategically positioned manufacturing facilities," said Robert G. Gwin, chairman of the LyondellBasell supervisory board.  "The supervisory board is grateful to Jim for his exceptional contributions to the company.  As the company moves forward, we will build on the solid foundation Jim created by continuing to focus on safety, cost control, taking maximum advantage of market opportunities and by investing in technology-driven growth," he added.  
"There is never a perfect time to leave a company with as much promise as LyondellBasell, but this is the right time for me," Gallogly said. "Having achieved the goals that I set for myself professionally and for the company, I feel it's time to move on to the next chapter, putting a priority on my family and philanthropic efforts. The company is at a point where the successful strategies and strong leadership team we have in place are poised to take full advantage of the favorable industry conditions that are expected for the foreseeable future.  I truly believe the company's best days lie ahead."
