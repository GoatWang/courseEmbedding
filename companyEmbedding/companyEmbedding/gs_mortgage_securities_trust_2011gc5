      Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2011-GC5
    





October 05, 2012 11:23 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of Goldman Sachs Commercial 
      Mortgage Capital, L.P., series 2011-GC5 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates as follows:
    

      --$73.6 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$476.5 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$86.4 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$568.2 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$1.385 billion class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$181 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95.9 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69.8 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74.1 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28.3 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23.9 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      The affirmations are due to stable pool performance. There have been no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans since issuance. Fitch identified 
      one (1.43%) Loan of Concern, which experienced a decline in property 
      cash flows and a low debt service coverage ratio.
    

      As of the September 2012 distribution date, the pool's certificate 
      balance has paid down 0.96% to $1.728 billion from $1.745 billion.
    

      The largest loan of the pool (11.36%) is secured by 478,028 square feet 
      of in-line and major tenant retail space within a 1.1 million square 
      foot (sf) regional mall in Tucson, AZ. The property is anchored by 
      Sears, Dillard's, Macy's (non-collateral) and Century Theaters 
      (collateral). As of second-quarter 2012, the occupancy and debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) was similar to that from issuance at 93% and 
      1.45x. The former Borders Books & Music (5.6%) space, vacant since 
      year-end 2011, has been recently leased to Total Wine & More. The Total 
      Wine & More lease commenced on Aug. 1, 2012 and is pursuant to a 15-year 
      term.
    

      Additional information on Fitch's criteria is available in the Dec. 21, 
      2011 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for U.S. Fixed-Rate CMBS 
      Transactions', which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      under the following headers:
    

      Structured Finance >> CMBS >> Criteria Reports
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

Approximately $1.1 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, March 31, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has 
affirmed the ratings on eleven classes in GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
2011-GC5, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2011-GC5 as follows:




Cl. A-2 Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously 
on Apr 21, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)

Cl. X-B Certificate, Affirmed Ba3 (sf); previously

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on nine P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes, Classes X-A* and X-B*, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.9% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.6% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.0% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.9% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.


Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014 and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only Securities methodology published in October 
2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of GSMS 2011-GC5. Please see "Moody's 
Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 13, 
compared to 15 at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, and property type. Moody's also further 
adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated 
with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 10, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 32.3% to 
$1.18 billion from $1.7 billion at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 50 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 15.4% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 60.7% 
of the pool. Two loans, constituting 5.8% of 
the pool, have investment-grade structured credit assessments. 
Five loans, constituting 10.6% of the pool, 
have defeased and are secured by US government securities.




Six loans, constituting 6.5% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




There are no loans that have been liquidated from the pool with a loss. 
One loan, constituting 1.2% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. The specially serviced loan is 
the Hills Loan ($14.25 million -- 1.2% 
of the pool), which is secured by a complex of office/flex buildings 
located in North Richland Hills, Texas. The loan transferred 
to special servicing on April 2013 due to imminent default. The 
subjects largest tenant, ATI Enterprises (44% of the GLA), 
defaulted and vacated the site without notice in February of 2013. 
The property became REO in July 2013. As per the September 2016 
rent roll the property was 87.8% leased, compared 
to 54% leased as of December 2015. In November 2016, 
LNR Partners LLC replaced Torchlight Loan Services as the Special Servicer 
for the loan.




Moody's has assumed a high default probability for three poorly 
performing loans, constituting 5% of the pool, and 
has estimated an aggregate loss of $17.8 million (a 30% 
expected loss based on a 66% probability default) from these troubled 
loans.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 88% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 88% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 81.4%, 
compared to 79.8% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 14.8% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.13%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.65X and 1.25X, 
respectively, compared to 1.71X and 1.28X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Museum Square 
Loan ($58.4 million -- 4.9% of the pool), 
which is secured by a 553,000 square foot (SF) class B+ office 
building located in the Miracle Mile submarket of Los Angeles, California. 
As per the January 2017 rent roll the property was 90% leased, 
the same as of January 2016. Moody's structured credit assessment 
and stressed DSCR are aa3 (sca.pd) and 1.81X, respectively, 
compared to a1 (sca.pd) and 1.75X at the last review.




The second loan with a structured credit assessment is the Alhambra Renaissance 
Center Loan ($9.7 million -- 0.8% of 
the pool), which is secured by a Regal Cinema anchored center located 
in Alhambra, California, approximately 10 miles northeast 
of Los Angeles. The Regal Cinema occupies 87.5% of 
the NRA, with a lease due to expire in November 2017. Due 
to the single tenant concentration, Moody's valuation reflects a 
lit/dark analysis. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed 
DSCR are baa3 (sca.pd) and 1.36X, respectively, 
compared to a2 (sca.pd) and 1.77X at the last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 37.6% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Park Place Mall Loan ($182 
million -- 15.4% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 478,000 square foot (SF) interest of a 1.06 million 
square feet (SF) dominant super-regional mall in Tucson, 
Arizona. Sears, Dillard's and Macy's anchor the mall and 
own their own spaces. The largest collateral tenant is an 18-screen 
movie theatre. As per the September 2016 rent roll the total mall 
and in-line occupancy was 98.6% and 96.7%, 
compared to 97.9% and 93.7% as of December 
2015. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 85.5% and 
1.08X, respectively, compared to 85.9% 
and 1.07X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the 1551 Broadway Loan ($180 million 
-- 15.2% of the pool), which is secured by a 
26,000 square foot (SF) single tenant retail property and a 15,000 
square foot (SF) LED sign located in the Bow Tie area of Manhattan's Times 
Square district. The property and LED sign are leased to AE Outfitters, 
Inc. a fully owned subsidiary of American Eagle Outfitters, 
Inc. through February 2024. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 87.7% and 0.95X, respectively, the 
same as at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan ($82.9 
million -- 7% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 743,000 square foot (SF) interest in a 1.41 million 
square foot (SF) super-regional mall in Beaumont, Texas. 
Sears, Dillard's, JC Penney's and Macy's anchor the mall and 
own their own spaces. The Macy's at this property which occupies 
13% of the NRA with a lease expiration of 2023, was on the 
official store closure list and subsequently closed this month. 
As per the September 2016 rent roll total mall collateral was 94.6% 
leased (includes Macy's), compared to 96.7% 
As of September 2015. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 75.3% 
and 1.4X, respectively, compared to 70.5% 
and 1.46X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.








Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The securities offered by this structural and collateral term sheet (this “Term Sheet”) are described in greater detail in the prospectus included as part of our registration statement (SEC File No. 333-171508) (the “Base Prospectus”) and a separate free writing prospectus to be dated September 19, 2011 (the “Free Writing Prospectus” and, collectively with the Base Prospectus, the “Free Writing Prospectus”).  The Base Prospectus and the Free Writing Prospectus contain material information that is not contained in this Term Sheet (including without limitation a detailed discussion of risks associated with an investment in the securities, under “Risk Factors” in
each of the Base Prospectus and the Free Writing Prospectus).  The Base Prospectus and the Free Writing Prospectus are available upon request from Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., RBS Securities Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Term Sheet have the respective meanings assigned to those terms in the Free Writing Prospectus or, if not defined in the Free Writing Prospectus, in the Base Prospectus.  This Term Sheet is subject to change.
 
The Securities May Not Be a Suitable Investment for You
 
The securities offered by this Term Sheet are not suitable investments for all investors. In particular, you should not purchase any class of securities unless you understand and are able to bear the prepayment, credit, liquidity and market risks associated with that class of securities. For those reasons and for the reasons set forth in the “Risk Factors” to each of the Base Prospectus and the Free Writing Prospectus, the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the offered securities are subject to material variability from period to period and give rise to the potential for significant loss over the life of those securities. The interaction of these factors and their effects are impossible to predict and are likely to change from time to time. As a result, an investment in the offered securities involves substantial risks and uncertainties and should be considered
only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate due diligence on the mortgage loans and the securities. Potential investors are advised and encouraged to review the Free Writing Prospectus in full and to consult with their legal, tax, accounting and other advisors prior to making any investment in the offered securities described in this Term Sheet.
 
This Term Sheet is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be illegal.  The information contained in this Term Sheet may not pertain to any securities that will actually be sold.  The information contained in this Term Sheet may be based on assumptions regarding market conditions and other matters as reflected in this Term Sheet.  We make no representations regarding the reasonableness of such assumptions or the likelihood that any of such assumptions will coincide with actual market conditions or events, and this Term Sheet should not be relied upon for such purposes.  We and our affiliates, officers, directors, partners and employees, including persons involved in the preparation or issuance of this Term Sheet may, from time to time, have long or short positions in, and buy or sell, the securities mentioned
in this Term Sheet or derivatives thereof (including options).  Information contained in this Term Sheet is current as of the date appearing on this Term Sheet only.  Information in this Term Sheet regarding the securities and the mortgage loans backing any securities discussed in this Term Sheet supersedes all prior information regarding such securities and mortgage loans. None of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., RBS Securities Inc. or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC provides accounting, tax or legal advice.
 


The securities offered by these materials are being offered when, as and if issued. In particular, you are advised that the offered securities, and the asset pool backing them, are subject to modification or revision (including, among other things, the possibility that one or more classes of securities may be split, combined or eliminated), at any time prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus. As a result, you may commit to purchase securities that have characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of the offered securities may not be issued that have the characteristics described in these materials. Our obligation to sell securities to you is conditioned on the offered securities and the underlying transaction having the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will
notify you, and neither the issuer nor any of the underwriters will have any obligation to you to deliver all or any portion of the securities which you have committed to purchase, and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

Ratings shown arethose of Fitch, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC. Certain nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that were not hired by the depositor may use information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to rate the certificates. There can be no assurance as to what ratings a non-hired nationally recognized statistical rating organization would assign. See “Risk Factors—Other Rating Agencies May Have Assigned Different Ratings to the Certificates, and Ratings of the Certificates Reflect Only the Views of the Applicable Rating Agencies as of the Dates Such Ratings Were Issued; Ratings May Affect ERISA Eligibility; Ratings May Be Downgraded ” in the Free Writing Prospectus. Fitch, Inc. and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have informed us that the “sf”
designation in the ratings represents an identifier of structured finance product ratings and was implemented by Fitch, Inc. and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for ratings of structured finance products as of August 2010. For additional information about this identifier, prospective investors can go to www.fitchratings.com and www.moodys.com.

Approximate, subject to a variance of plus or minus 5%.







(3)


Approximate as of the closing date.







(4)


Assuming no prepayments and based on the Modeling Assumptions set forth under “Yield, Prepayment and Maturity Considerations” in the Free Writing Prospectus.







(5)


The credit support percentages set forth for the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates are represented in the aggregate.







(6)


For any distribution date, the pass-through rates on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class G certificates will each be equal to one of (i) a fixed per annum rate, (ii) the weighted average of the net interest rates on the mortgage loans (in each case, adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) as of their respective due dates in the month preceding the month in which the related distribution date occurs, (iii) a rate equal to the lesser of a specified pass-through rate and the rate specified in clause (ii), or (iv) the rate specified in clause (ii) less a specified percentage.







(7)


The Class X-A and Class X-B certificates will not have principal amounts and will not be entitled to receive distributions of principal. Interest will accrue on the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates at their respective pass-through rates based upon their respective notional amounts. The notional amount of the Class X-A certificates will be equal to the aggregate principal amounts of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-S certificates from time to time. The notional amount of the Class X-B certificates will be equal to the aggregate principal amounts of the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class G certificates from time to time.







(8)


The pass-through rate on the Class X-A certificates will generally be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the weighted average of the net interest rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), over (ii) the weighted average of the pass-through rates of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-S certificates as described in the Free Writing Prospectus. The pass-through rate on the Class X-B certificates will generally be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the weighted average of the net interest rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), over (ii) the weighted average of the pass-through rates of the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class G certificates as described in the Free Writing Prospectus.







(9)


The Class R certificates will not have a certificate principal amount, notional amount, pass-through rate, rating or rated final distribution date. The Class R certificates represent the residual interests in two separate REMICs, as further described in the Free Writing Prospectus. The Class R certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal or interest.







(10)


The Class S certificates will not have a principal amount, notional amount, pass-through rate, rating or rated final distribution date. The Class S certificates will only be entitled to distributions of excess interest accrued on mortgage loans with anticipated repayment dates.

The Copper Beech Portfolio mortgage loan and a related B-note (the “Companion Loan” and together with the Copper Beech Portfolio mortgage loan, the “Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan”) are both secured by the same mortgage instruments on the same mortgaged properties.  All information presented in this Term Sheet with respect to that mortgage loan is calculated without regard to the related Companion Loan, unless otherwise indicated. With the inclusion of the related Companion Loan, the Cut-off Date Principal Balance per Unit, the DSCR based on Underwritten NOI / NCF, the Debt Yield Based on Underwritten     NOI / NCF, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio and the Maturity Date LTV Ratio of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan are $121,788, 1.42x / 1.37x, 9.6% / 9.3%, 74.0% and 69.0%, respectively.







(2)  


Unless otherwise indicated, mortgage loans with anticipated repayment dates are considered as if they mature on the related anticipated repayment date.







(3)  


Excludes mortgage loans that are interest only for the entire term.







(4)  


Unless otherwise indicated, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio is calculated utilizing the “as-is” appraised value.  With respect to the mortgaged property identified as Copper Beech Portfolio – CBTC 29 San Marcos, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for the Copper Beech Portfolio mortgage loan was calculated using the related “as stabilized” appraised value for the CBTC 29 San Marcos property.  The Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for the Copper Beech Portfolio mortgage loan using the related “as-is” appraised value for the CBTC 29 San Marcos property is 70.1%.  With respect to the mortgaged properties identified as Rivercrest Realty Portfolio 2 – Ridgeview Plaza and Rivercrest Realty Portfolio 2 – East River Plaza, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for the Rivercrest Realty Portfolio 2 mortgage loan was calculated using the related “as stabilized” appraised value for the Ridgeview Plaza and East River Plaza properties.  The Cut-off
Date LTV Ratio for the Rivercrest Realty Portfolio 2 mortgage loan using the related “as-is” appraised value for the Ridgeview Plaza and East River Plaza properties is 75.0%.







(5)  


Unless otherwise indicated, with respect to the Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores Phase I and Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores Phase II mortgage loans, which are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio, the Maturity Date LTV Ratio, the Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio, the Debt Yield on Underwritten NOI and the Debt Yield on Underwritten NCF of the mortgage loans are presented in the aggregate.







(6)  


Unless otherwise indicated, the Maturity Date LTV Ratio is calculated utilizing the “as-is” appraised value.  With respect to the Hyatt Regency Boston mortgage loan, the Ashland Town Center mortgage loan, the Courtyard and Residence Inn – Franklin mortgage loan, the Hilton Suites Lexington Green mortgage loan, the Holiday Inn Express Anchorage mortgage loan, the Courtyard and Residence Inn – Southaven mortgage loan, the Southpark Office Building mortgage loan, the Embassy Suites – Tempe mortgage loan and the Hampton Inn – Colorado Springs South mortgage loan, the respective Maturity Date LTV Ratios were each calculated using the related “as stabilized” appraised value. The Maturity Date LTV Ratio using the related “as-is” appraised value for each of these mortgage loans is 58.0%, 52.3%, 64.1%, 69.3%, 53.2%, 61.0%, 52.6%, 52.0% and 60.7%.  See “Description of the Mortgage Pool – Certain
Calculations and Definitions” in the Free Writing Prospectus for a description of Maturity Date LTV Ratio.







(7)  


Unless otherwise indicated, the Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio is calculated by taking the Underwritten Net Cash Flow from the related mortgaged property or mortgaged properties and dividing by the annual debt service for such mortgage loan, as adjusted by using the first 12 amortizing payments due instead of the actual interest-only payment, in the case of mortgage loans in a partial interest–only period.  With respect to the Trinity Square Crossed Portfolio mortgage loan the Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.27x reflects a master lease at the Trinity Square Crossed Portfolio - Trinity Square Retail Center mortgaged property between the borrower and the indirect parent of the borrower for approximately 1,775 SF, which represents approximately 6.7% of the total leaseable space. The Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio without taking the master lease into account is 1.22x.  See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool – Certain Calculations and Definitions  in the Free Writing Prospectus for a description of Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio.







(8)  


Unless otherwise indicated, the Debt Yield on Underwritten NOI is the related mortgaged property’s Underwritten NOI divided by the Cut-off Date Balance of the mortgage loan.

STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW



 




Distributions


On each distribution date, funds available for distribution from the mortgage loans, net of specified trust expenses and excess interest collected on mortgage loans with anticipated repayment dates, will be distributed in the following amounts and order of priority (in each case to the extent of remaining available funds):
 
1.     Class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, X-A and X-B certificates: To interest on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class X-A and Class X-B certificates, pro rata, in each case in accordance with their respective interest entitlements.
 
2.     Class A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 certificates: (i) to principal on the Class A-1 certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero, all funds allocable to principal attributable to all mortgage loans, then (ii) to principal on the Class A-2 certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero, all funds available for distribution of principal remaining after the distributions to Class A-1 in clause (i) above, then (iii) to principal on the Class A-3 certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero, all funds available for distribution of principal remaining after the distributions to Class A-2 in clause (ii) above, then (iv) to principal on the Class A-4 certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero, all funds available for distribution of principal remaining after the distributions to Class A-3 in clause (iii) above.  If the
certificate principal amounts of each and every class of certificates other than the Class A-1,  Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of mortgage loan losses to those certificates, funds available for distributions of principal will be distributed to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates, pro rata, based on their respective certificate principal amounts.
 
3.     Class A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 certificates: To reimburse Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates, pro rata, for any previously unreimbursed losses on the mortgage loans allocable to principal that were previously borne by those classes, together with interest at their respective pass-through rates.
 
4.     Class A-S certificates:  (a) first, to interest on Class A-S certificates in the amount of their interest entitlement; (b) next, to the extent of funds allocated to principal remaining after distributions in respect of principal to each class with a higher priority (in this case, the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates), to principal on Class A-S certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero; and (c) next, to reimburse Class A-S certificates for any previously unreimbursed losses on the mortgage loans allocable to principal that were previously borne by that class, together with interest at their respective pass-through rate.
 
5.     Class B certificates:  (a) first, to interest on Class B certificates in the amount of their interest entitlement; (b) next, to the extent of funds allocated to principal remaining after distributions in respect of principal to each class with a higher priority (in this case, the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-S certificates), to principal on Class B certificates until their certificate principal amount is reduced to zero; and (c) next, to reimburse Class B certificates for any previously unreimbursed losses on the mortgage loans allocable to principal that were previously borne by that class, together with interest at their respective pass-through rate.
 
6.     After Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S and Class B certificates are paid all amounts to which they are entitled, the remaining funds available for distribution will be used to pay interest and principal and to reimburse any previously unreimbursed losses to the Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, and Class G certificates sequentially in that order in a manner analogous to the Class B certificates, until the certificate principal amount of each such class is reduced to zero.

The certificate principal amounts of the Class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-S, B, C, D, E, F and G certificates (the “Sequential Pay Certificates”) will each be reduced without distribution on any Distribution Date as a write-off to the extent of any loss realized on the mortgage loans allocated to the applicable such class on such Distribution Date. Any such write-offs will be applied to such classes of certificates in the following order, in each case until the related certificate principal amount is reduced to zero:  first, to the Class G certificates; second, to the Class F certificates; third, to the Class E certificates; fourth, to the Class D certificates; fifth, to the Class C certificates; sixth, to the Class B certificates; seventh, to the Class A-S certificates; and, finally pro rata, to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates, based on their then current
respective certificate principal amounts.  The notional amount of the Class X-A certificates will be reduced to reflect reductions in the certificate principal amounts of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-S certificates resulting from allocations of losses realized on the mortgage loans. The notional amount of the Class X-B certificates will be reduced to reflect reductions in the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class G certificates resulting from allocations of losses realized on the mortgage loans.

STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW (continued)



 




Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges
 


On each Distribution Date, any yield maintenance charge collected on the mortgage loans during the one-month period ending on the related Determination Date is required to be distributed to certificateholders as follows: (1) pro rata, between (x) the group (the “YM Group A”) of Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S and Class X-A certificates, and (y) the group (the “YM Group B” and collectively with the YM Group A, the “YM Groups”) of Class B, Class C, Class D and Class X-B certificates, based upon the aggregate of principal distributed to the Classes of Sequential Pay Certificates in each YM Group on such Distribution Date, and (2) as among the classes of certificates in each YM Group, in the following manner:  (A) the holders of each Class of Sequential Pay Certificates in such YM Group will be entitled to receive on each Distribution
Date the portion of such yield maintenance charge in an amount equal to the product of (x) a fraction whose numerator is the amount of principal distributed to such class on such Distribution Date and whose denominator is the total amount of principal distributed to all of the Sequential Pay Certificates in that YM Group on such Distribution Date, (y) the Base Interest Fraction for the related principal prepayment and such class of certificates, and (z) the aggregate portion of such yield maintenance charge allocated to such YM Group, and (B) any portion of such yield maintenance charge allocated to such YM Group, and remaining after such distributions to the applicable Sequential Pay Certificates, will be distributed to the Class X-A or Class X-B certificates, as applicable, in such YM Group.  If there is more than one class of Sequential Pay Certificates in any YM Group entitled to distributions of principal on any particular Distribution Date on which
yield maintenance charges are allocable to such YM Group, the aggregate amount of such yield maintenance charges will be allocated among all such Classes of Sequential Pay Certificates up to, and on a pro rata basis in accordance with, their respective entitlements in those yield maintenance charges in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph.
 
No prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges will be distributed to holders of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class R or Class S certificates.  Instead, after the certificate principal amounts or notional amount, as applicable, of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S, Class X-A, Class B, Class C, and Class D certificates have been reduced to zero, all prepayment premiums and yield maintenance charges with respect to mortgage loans will be distributed to holders of the Class X-B certificates.  For a description of prepayment premiums and yield maintenance charges required on the mortgage loans, see Annex A to the Free Writing Prospectus.  See also “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans—Enforceability of Certain Provisions” in the Base Prospectus. Prepayment premiums and yield maintenance charges will be distributed on any Distribution Date only to the extent they are
received in respect of the mortgage loans as of the related Determination Date.
 
The “Base Interest Fraction” with respect to any principal prepayment on any mortgage loan and with respect to any class of Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class D certificates is a fraction (a) whose numerator is the amount, if any, by which (i) the pass-through rate on such class of certificates exceeds (ii) the discount rate used in accordance with the related loan documents in calculating the yield maintenance charge with respect to such principal prepayment and (b) whose denominator is the amount, if any, by which the (i) mortgage loan rate on such mortgage loan exceeds (ii) the discount rate used in accordance with the related loan documents in calculating the yield maintenance charge with respect to such principal prepayment; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the Base Interest Fraction be greater than one.  If
such discount rate is greater than or equal to the lesser of (x) the mortgage loan rate on the prepaid mortgage loan and (y) the pass-through rate described in the preceding sentence, then the Base Interest Fraction shall equal zero; provided, however, if such discount rate is greater than the mortgage loan rate, but less than the pass-through rate, the fraction will be one.
 



Advances


The master servicer and, if it fails to do so, the trustee, will be obligated to make P&I advances and servicing advances, including paying delinquent property taxes, condominium assessments, insurance premiums and ground lease rents, but only to the extent that those advances are not deemed non-recoverable from collections on the related mortgage loan and, in the case of P&I advances, subject to reduction in connection with any appraisal reductions that may occur.
 



Appraisal Reductions


An appraisal reduction generally will be created in the amount, if any, by which the principal balance of a required appraisal loan (which is a mortgage loan or whole loan with respect to which certain defaults, modifications or insolvency events have occurred as further described in the Free Writing Prospectus) plus other amounts overdue or advanced in connection with such mortgage loan or whole loan, as applicable, exceeds 90% of the appraised value of the related mortgaged property plus certain escrows and reserves (including letters of credit) held with respect to the mortgage loan or whole loan, as applicable.  As a result of calculating an appraisal reduction amount for a given mortgage loan, the interest portion of any P&I advance for such mortgage loan will be reduced, which will have the effect of reducing the amount of interest available for distribution to the certificates (exclusive of the Class R certificates)
in reverse alphabetical order of the classes (except that interest payments on the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates would be affected on a pari passu basis and interest payments on the Class A-S certificates will be affected before interest payments on the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 certificates).  With respect to each mortgage loan that is part of a split loan structure, the appraisal reduction amount will be allocated to the related Companion Loan prior to being allocated to the related mortgage loan.

STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW (continued)



 




Appraisal Reductions (continued)


A mortgage loan or whole loan, as applicable, will cease to be a required appraisal loan when the same has ceased to be a specially serviced mortgage loan (if applicable), has been brought current for at least three consecutive months and no other circumstances exist that would cause such mortgage loan or whole loan to be a required appraisal loan.
 
At any time an Appraisal is ordered with respect to a property that would result in appraisal reductions that would result in a change of the controlling class or a control change with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, certain subordinate certificateholders or the Whole Loan Directing Holder, as applicable, will have a right to request a new appraisal as described in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 



Age of Appraisals


Appraisals (which can be an update of a prior appraisal) are required to be no older than 9 months for purposes of determining appraisal reductions, market value, and other calculations as described in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 



Sale of Defaulted Loans


There will be no “Fair Market Value Option”, instead defaulted loans will be sold in a process similar to the sale process for REO property subject to the Controlling Class Representative’s right of first refusal with respect to the sale of defaulted loans.
 



Cleanup Call


On any distribution date on which the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans remaining in the issuing entity is less than 1% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date, certain specified persons will have the option to purchase all of the remaining mortgage loans (and all property acquired through exercise of remedies in respect of any mortgage loan) at the price specified in the Free Writing Prospectus.  Exercise of the option will terminate the issuing entity and retire the then outstanding certificates.
 
If the certificate principal amounts or notional amount, as applicable, of the Class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-S, X-A, B, C and D certificates have been reduced to zero and if the master servicer has received from the remaining certificateholders the payment specified in the pooling and servicing agreement, the issuing entity could also be terminated in connection with an exchange of all the then-outstanding certificates, including the Class X-B certificates (but excluding the Class S and Class R certificates), for the mortgage loans remaining in the issuing entity, but all of the holders of those classes of outstanding certificates would have to voluntarily participate in the exchange.
 



Whole Loan


Solely with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio mortgage loan which is part of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, a split loan structure, the holder of the related Companion Loan (the “Whole Loan Directing Holder”) will have certain rights pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement until the holder of the Companion Loan is no longer the Whole Loan Directing Holder, including the right to approve or direct material servicing decisions, the right to replace the special servicer for the related whole loan, the right to cure defaults affecting the related mortgage loan and the right to purchase the related mortgage loan following a material default.
 



Controlling Class Representative


The “Controlling Class Representative” will be the controlling class certificateholder or representative designated by at least a majority of the voting rights of the controlling class.  The controlling class is the most subordinate class of the Class E, Class F and Class G certificates that has an aggregate certificate principal amount as reduced by principal payments, and as further reduced by realized losses (and appraisal reductions) allocated to such class, that is equal to or greater than 25% of the initial certificate principal amount of that class of certificates.  No other class of certificates will be eligible to act as the controlling class or appoint a Controlling Class Representative.
 
It is anticipated that Torchlight Investors, LLC, on behalf of one or more managed funds or accounts, will be the initial Controlling Class Representative.
 



Control/Consultation Rights


The Controlling Class Representative will be entitled to have consultation and approval rights with respect to certain major decisions (including with respect to assumptions, waivers, loan modifications and workouts) until no class of the Class E, Class F and Class G certificates has an aggregate certificate principal amount as reduced by principal payments, and as further reduced by realized losses (and appraisal reductions) allocated to such class, that is equal to or greater than 25% of the initial certificate amount of that class of certificates  (a “Control Termination Event”).
 
So long as a Control Termination Event does not exist, the Controlling Class Representative will be entitled to direct the special servicer to take, or refrain from taking, certain actions that would constitute major decisions with respect to a loan and will also have the right to notice and consent to certain material actions that would constitute major decisions that the servicer and the special servicer plan on taking with respect to a mortgage loan subject to the servicing standard and other restrictions as described in the Free Writing Prospectus.

STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW (continued)



 




Control/Consultation Rights (continued)


Following the occurrence and during the continuation of a Control Termination Event until such time no Class of the Class E, Class F and Class G certificates has an outstanding certificate principal amount, as reduced by any principal payments and realized losses, but without regard to the application of any appraisal reductions, that is equal to or greater 25% of the initial certificate principal amount of that class of certificates (a “Consultation Termination Event”), all of the rights of the Controlling Class Representative will terminate other than a right to consult with respect to the major decisions in which they previously had approval rights.  After the occurrence and during the continuation of a Control Termination Event, the operating advisor will be entitled to consult with the special servicer with respect to certain major decisions on behalf of the issuing entity and in the best interest
of, and for the benefit of, the certificateholders, as a collective whole, as if those certificateholders constituted a single lender.
 
Following the occurrence and during the continuation of a Consultation Termination Event, all rights of the Controlling Class Representative will terminate.  Also, the Controlling Class Representative will not have any rights with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan for so long as the holder of the Companion Loan is the Whole Loan Directing Holder.
 



Servicing Standard


In all circumstances, the special servicer is obligated to act in the best interests of the certificateholders and, in the case of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, the holder of the Companion Loan (as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and, if applicable, such holder of the Companion Loan constituted a single lender).  The special servicer is required to determine the effect on net present value of various courses of action (including workout or foreclosure), using the Calculation Rate as the discount rate, and pursue the course of action that it determines would maximize recovery on a net present value basis.
 
“Calculation Rate” means:
 
—    for principal and interest payments on a mortgage loan or from the sale of a defaulted loan, the highest of (i) the rate determined by the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, that approximates the market rate that would be obtainable by borrowers on similar debt of the borrowers as of such date of determination, (ii) the note rate and (iii) the yield on the most recently issued 10-year US treasuries; and
 
—    for all other cash flows, including property cash flow, the “discount rate” set forth in the most recent appraisal (or update of such appraisal).
 



Termination of Special Servicer


Prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event the special servicer may be replaced at any time by the Controlling Class Representative.
 
With respect to the pool of mortgage loans (other than with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan for as long as the holder of the Companion Loan is the Whole Loan Directing Holder), after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event, the holders of at least 25% of the voting rights of the certificates (other than the Class S and Class R certificates) may request a vote to replace the special servicer.  The subsequent vote may result in the termination and replacement of the special servicer if within 180 days of the initial request for that vote the holders of (a) at least 75% of the voting rights of the certificates (other than the Class S and Class R certificates), or (b) more than 50% of the voting rights of each class of Sequential Pay Certificates (but only those classes of Sequential Pay Certificates that, in each case, have an outstanding certificate principal amount, as reduced
or notionally reduced by realized losses and appraisal reductions, equal to or greater than 25% of the initial certificate principal amount of such class, as reduced by payments of principal), vote affirmatively to so replace.
 
At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Consultation Termination Event, if the operating advisor determines that the special servicer is not performing its duties as required under the pooling and servicing agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the servicing standard, the operating advisor may recommend the replacement of the special servicer (other than with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan for as long as the holder of the Companion Loan is the Whole Loan Directing Holder) resulting in a solicitation of a certificateholder vote.  The subsequent vote may result in the termination and replacement of the special servicer if within 180 days of the initial request for that vote the holders of more than 50% of the voting rights of each class of Sequential Pay Certificates (but only those classes of Sequential Pay Certificates that have, in each such case, an outstanding
certificate principal amount, as reduced or notionally reduced by realized losses and appraisal reductions, equal to or greater than 25% of the initial certificate principal amounts of such class of Certificates, as reduced by payments of principal), vote affirmatively to so replace.
 
In the case of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, however, only the Whole Loan Directing Holder may terminate the special servicer, without cause, until the holder of the Companion Loan is no longer the Whole Loan Directing Holder.

STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW (continued)



 




Servicing Fees


Modification and Extension Fees: All fees resulting from modifications, amendments, waivers or any other changes to the terms of the mortgage loan documents, as more fully described in the Free Writing Prospectus, will be used to offset expenses on the related mortgage loan (reimburse the trust for certain expenses previously incurred (other than special servicing fees, workout fees and liquidation fees) on the related mortgage loan but not yet reimbursed to the trust or servicers or to pay expenses (other than special servicing fees, workout fees and liquidation fees) on the related mortgage loan that are still outstanding).  Within any given 12 month period, all such fees will be capped at 1.0% for all mortgage loans, subject to a minimum fee cap of $25,000.  All such fees received by the special servicer as compensation on the related mortgage loan will offset all future workout and liquidation
fees earned on that mortgage loan for the next 12 months after receipt of the modification and/or extension fee.
 
Penalty Fees: All late fees and default interest will first be used to reimburse certain expenses previously incurred (other than special servicing fees, workout fees and liquidation fees) but not yet reimbursed to the trust, the master servicer or special servicer or to pay certain expenses (other than special servicing fees, workout fees and liquidation fees) that are still outstanding on all mortgage loans and any excess will be paid to the master servicer (for penalty fees accrued while a non-specially serviced loan) and the special servicer (for penalty fees accrued while specially serviced loan).  To the extent any amounts reimbursed out of penalty charges are subsequently recovered on the related mortgage loan, they will be paid to the master servicer or special servicer who would have been entitled to the related penalty charges used to reimburse such expense.
 
Liquidation / Workout Fees: Liquidation fees will be calculated at 1.0% for all mortgage loans subject to a minimum liquidation fee of $25,000.  Workout Fees will be calculated at 1.0% after such mortgage loan becomes a corrected mortgage loan (or such higher rate as would result in a workout fee of $25,000 when applied to each expected payment of principal and interest on the related mortgage loan from the date such mortgage loan becomes a corrected mortgage loan through and including the related maturity date) for all mortgage loans.
 



Operating Advisor


Prior to the occurrence of a Control Termination Event, the operating advisor will have access to any final asset status report and all information available with respect to the transaction on the certificate administrator’s website but will not have any approval or consultation rights.  After a Control Termination Event, the operating advisor will have consultation rights with respect to certain major decisions and will have additional monitoring responsibilities on behalf of the entire trust.
 
After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event, the operating advisor will be entitled to consult with the special servicer with respect to certain major decisions on behalf of the issuing entity and in the best interest of, and for the benefit of, the certificateholders, as a collective whole, as if those certificateholders constituted a single lender, but not consult with respect to major decisions with respect to the Whole Loan until the Companion Loan is no longer the Whole Loan Directing Holder.
 
The operating advisor will be subject to termination if at least 15% of the voting rights of Non-Reduced Certificates vote to terminate and replace the operating advisor and such vote is approved by more than 50% of the voting rights of Non-Reduced Certificates that exercise their right to vote, provided that at least 50% of the voting rights of Non-Reduced Certificates have exercised their right to vote.  The holders initiating such vote will be responsible for the fees and expenses in connection with the vote and replacement.
 



Deal Website


The certificate administrator will maintain a deal website including, but not limited to:
—    all special notices delivered
—    summaries of final asset status reports
—    all appraisals in connection with an appraisal reduction plus any subsequent appraisal updates
—    an “Investor Q&A Forum” and
—    a voluntary investor registry

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS (continued)



 




n


“Owned Tenant(s)”:  Tenants whose leased space at the related mortgaged property is owned by the related borrower and is part of the collateral for the related mortgage loan.



 




n


“Rating Agency Confirmation”:  With respect to any matter, confirmation in writing (which may be in electronic form) by Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, Fitch, Inc. or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. that a proposed action, failure to act or other event so specified will not, in and of itself, result in the downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the then current rating assigned by that rating agency to any class of certificates. However, such confirmation will be deemed received in certain circumstances as further described in the Free Writing Prospectus.  See “The Pooling and Servicing Agreement—Rating Agency Confirmations” in the Free Writing Prospectus.



 




n


“RevPAR”:  Means, with respect to any hospitality property, revenues per available room.



 




n


“SF”: Square feet.



 




n


“Soft Lockbox”:  Means the related borrower is required to deposit or cause the property manager to deposit all rents collected into a lockbox account. Hospitality properties are considered to have a soft lockbox if credit card receivables and cash or “over the counter” receipts are deposited into the lockbox account by the borrower or property manager.



 




n


“Springing Lockbox”:  Means a lockbox that is not currently in place, but the related loan documents require the imposition of a lockbox upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan documents or one or more specified trigger events.



 




n


“Total Occupancy”: With respect to any particular mortgaged property, as of a certain date, the percentage of net rentable square footage, rooms or units that are leased or rented (as applicable), for the aggregate leased space, rooms or units therein, including any space that is owned by the related borrower and is part of the collateral in addition to any space that is owned by the applicable tenant and not part of the collateral for the related mortgage loan. In some cases Total Occupancy was based on assumptions regarding occupancy, such as the assumption that a certain tenant at the mortgaged property that has executed a lease, but has not yet taken occupancy and / or has not yet commenced paying rent, will take occupancy on a future date generally expected to occur no later than 6 months after the Cut-off Date, assumptions regarding the renewal of particular leases and / or the re-leasing of certain space
at the related mortgaged property, or in some cases, the exclusion of dark tenants, tenants with material aged receivables, tenants that may have already given notice to vacate their space and bankrupt tenants that have not yet affirmed their lease.



 




n


“Underwritten Expenses”:  With respect to any mortgage loan or mortgaged property, an estimate of operating expenses, as determined by the related originator and generally derived from historical expenses at the mortgaged property(-ies), the borrower’s budget or appraiser’s estimate, in some cases adjusted for significant occupancy increases and a market-rate management fee.  We cannot assure you that the assumptions made with respect to any mortgaged property will, in fact, be consistent with that mortgaged property’s actual performance.



 




n


“Underwritten Net Cash Flow (NCF)”:  With respect to any mortgage loan or mortgaged property, cash flow available for debt service, generally equal to the Underwritten NOI decreased by an amount that the related originator has determined for tenant improvements and leasing commissions and / or replacement reserves for capital items.  Underwritten NCF does not reflect debt service or non-cash items such as depreciation or amortization.  In determining rental revenue for multifamily rental, manufactured housing community and self-storage properties, the related originator either reviewed rental revenue shown on the certified rolling 12-month operating statements or annualized the rental revenue and reimbursement of expenses shown on rent rolls or recent partial year operating statements with respect to the prior one- to 12-month periods.  The Underwritten Net Cash Flow for each mortgaged property is calculated
based on the basis of numerous assumptions and subjective judgments, which, if ultimately proved erroneous, could cause the actual operating income for the mortgaged property to differ materially from the Underwritten Net Cash Flow set forth in this Term Sheet.



 




n


“Underwritten Net Operating Income (NOI)”:  With respect to any mortgage loan or mortgaged property, Underwritten Revenues less Underwritten Expenses, as both are determined by the related originator, based in part upon borrower supplied information (including but not limited to a rent roll, leases, operating statements and budget) for a recent period which is generally the 12 months prior to the origination date or acquisition date of the mortgage loan (or whole loan, if applicable) adjusted for specific property, tenant and market considerations.  Historical operating statements may not be available for newly constructed mortgaged properties, mortgaged properties with triple net leases, mortgaged properties that have recently undergone substantial renovations and/or newly acquired mortgaged properties.  We cannot assure you that the information provided by any borrower is accurate or that the procedures used
by the applicable sponsor in determining the information presented in this Term Sheet were adequate.



 




n


“Underwritten Revenues”:  With respect to any mortgage loan or mortgaged property, an estimate of operating revenues, as determined by the related originator and generally derived from the rental revenue based on leases in place, leases that have been executed but the tenant is not yet paying rent and in certain cases contractual rent steps generally six months past the Cut-off Date, and in some cases adjusted downward to market rates, with vacancy rates equal to the mortgaged property’s historical rate, current rate, market rate or an assumed vacancy as determined by the related originator; plus any additional recurring revenue fees.  In some cases the related originator included revenue otherwise payable by a tenant but for the existence of an initial “free rent” period or a permitted rent abatement while the leased space is built out.  We cannot assure you that the assumptions
made with respect to any mortgaged property will, in fact, be consistent with that mortgaged property’s actual performance.

n


Escrows. At origination, the borrower deposited $2,710,345 into a reserve account to cover certain unfunded obligations at the Park Place Mall Property.  On each due date during the continuance of an event of default under the loan documents or a Park Place Trigger Period, the borrower is required to fund (i) a tax and insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax and insurance premiums over the then succeeding twelve month period, unless the borrower provides evidence that the required insurance is being provided under any blanket policy from GGPLP L.L.C. that has been paid in full, (ii) a tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve in the monthly amount of $33,729, subject to a maximum total escrowed amount of $404,748 and (iii) a capital expenditure reserve in the monthly amount of $13,146, subject to a maximum total escrowed amount
of $157,752.  In addition, the borrower is required to establish a reserve account for the deposit of casualty or condemnation loss proceeds exceeding $10,000,000.  During the continuance of a Park Place Trigger Period or while any permitted mezzanine debt is outstanding, the loan documents require that borrower fund a reserve in the amount of budgeted operating expenses for such month.



 
Furthermore, during the continuance of a Park Place Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all excess amounts on deposit in the lockbox account, after the payment of debt service and the funding of required monthly escrows for budgeted operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital expenditures, be reserved and held as additional collateral for the Park Place Mall Loan.  However, if no event of default is continuing, the borrower may obtain disbursements from the excess amounts for payment of capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions to the extent funds in the reserve accounts are insufficient.
 
A “Park Place Trigger Period” means any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as defined in the loan agreement) of the Park Place Mall Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is less than $15,197,853 and terminating as of the end of the second fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Park Place Mall Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is greater than or equal to $15,197,853.
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Park Place Mall Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled lockbox account or a blocked account.  The loan documents also require that all rents and other amounts (other than de minimis amounts collected at the Park Place Mall Property not exceeding $25,000 per year, amounts collected on behalf of charities and certain multi-property, parent-level sponsorship revenue) received by the borrower or the property manager be deposited into the cash lockbox account or a blocked account within three business days after receipt.  All amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on a daily basis.  On each business day that no event of default under the Park Place Mall Loan is continuing and no Park Place Trigger Period
is continuing, all funds in the cash management account in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an operating account pledged to lender but accessible by borrower.  During the continuance of a monetary event of default or certain other material events of default under the Park Place Mall Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the Park Place Mall Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of the Park Place Mall Property, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management. The Park Place Mall Property is currently self-managed by the borrower.  Under the loan documents, the Park Place Mall Property must remain (i) self-managed, (ii) managed by General Growth Management, Inc. or any affiliate of General Growth Properties, Inc. or (iii) managed by a management company approved by the lender and with respect to which the lender has received Rating Agency Confirmation.  Upon the

the terrorism and seismic components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is no larger than $100,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Park Place Mall Property are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

balance in the excess cash flow reserve account will be capped at $5,000,000 provided that no event of default is continuing and the only 1551 Broadway Trigger Period that exists is a Specified Tenant Operating Trigger Period.  Provided that no event of default or 1551 Broadway Trigger Period exists other than a Specified Tenant Operating Trigger Period, any excess cash flow available in the cash management account after the balance in the excess cash flow reserve account is at least $5,000,000 will be transferred to the borrower.

abatement of these materials and also recommended Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Programs for asbestos, mold and lead based paint. The borrower completed the asbestos abatement on June 20, 2011.

 




n


The Borrowers.  The borrowers are 4 Delaware limited liability companies, each a single-purpose, single-asset entity.  Legal counsel to the borrowers delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan.  The borrowers of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan are indirectly owned by a group of individual investors, with the largest single investors being John R. McWhirter and Jeanette D. McWhirter.  John and Jeanette McWhirter serve as the sponsor and non-recourse carve-out guarantors for the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan.  John McWhirter is the founder and Senior CEO of Copper Beech Townhome Communities.



 




n


Escrows.  At origination, the borrowers deposited $238,150 into a reserve account to fund the cost of radon testing and remediation at the Harrisonburg Property.  In addition, the borrowers deposited $8,625,000 into another reserve account to fund outstanding construction liabilities at the San Marcos Property. The borrowers also deposited $2,500,000 into a reserve account to be released pending receipt of survey and title for the IUP Property.  The borrowers have provided survey and final zoning reports for the IUP Property and the $2,500,000 reserve was subsequently released on June 6, 2011.  As of July 14, 2011, $8,434,754 has been released from the initial $8,625,000 San Marcos holdback. On each due date, the borrowers are required to fund a tax and insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the
amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax and insurance premiums over the then succeeding twelve month period.  Additionally, the borrowers are required to fund a capital expenditure reserve in the monthly amount of $38,150.



 
Furthermore, during the continuance of a Copper Beech Portfolio Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all revenues from the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties, after the payment of debt service, budgeted operating expenses and the funding of required monthly escrows for real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, be reserved and held as additional collateral for the Copper Beech Portfolio Loan.
 
A “Copper Beech Portfolio Trigger Period” means any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is less than $11,809,598 (as adjusted to account for property releases) and terminating as of the end of the second consecutive fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is greater than or equal to $11,809,598 (as adjusted to account for property releases).
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan requires a springing lockbox, which is to be established upon the commencement of a Copper Beech Portfolio Trigger Period or the occurrence of an event of default under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan.  The borrowers’ failure to establish the lockbox in accordance with the loan documents is a recourse event that is guaranteed by John R. McWhirter and Jeanette D. McWhirter.  The loan documents require that, during the continuance of a Copper Beech Portfolio Trigger Period or an event of default under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, all rents received by the borrowers or the property manager be deposited into a lender-controlled lockbox account or cash management account within one business day after receipt.  All amounts in the lockbox account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on a daily basis.  During the
continuance of an event of default under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management. The Copper Beech Portfolio Properties are currently self-managed by the borrowers.  Under the loan documents, the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties must remain self-managed or be managed by a management company approved by the lender and with respect to which the lender has received Rating Agency Confirmation.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default while the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties are self-managed, the lender has the right to require the borrowers to cease such self-management and to

engage a property manager selected by lender and with respect to which the lender has received Rating Agency Confirmation. At any time that the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties are managed by a management company, upon the occurrence of an event of default, a material default under the management agreement by the property manager, the filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to the property manager, the lender may require borrowers to replace the manager with an approved property manager selected by lender and with respect to which the lender has received Rating Agency Confirmation.

 




n


Release of Collateral.  Provided no event of default is then continuing under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, at any time on or after the first due date following the second anniversary of the securitization closing date, the borrowers may obtain the release of one or more of the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties from the liens of the loan documents, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the loan documents, including among others: (i) delivery of defeasance collateral sufficient to defease an amount equal to 125% of the allocated loan amount for each Copper Beech Portfolio Property being released, (ii) after giving effect to the release, the debt service coverage ratio (as calculated under the loan agreement) for the remaining Copper Beech Portfolio Properties for the twelve-month period preceding the end of the most recent fiscal quarter is no less than
the greater of (a) 1.44x and (b) the debt service coverage ratio immediately prior to the release and (iii) delivery of Rating Agency Confirmation.



 




n


Mezzanine or Subordinate Indebtedness. Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (“GSLP”), the related mortgage loan seller of the Copper Beech Portfolio Loan, or an affiliate thereof, will initially hold the junior note in the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan (the “Copper Beech Portfolio Companion Loan”), which Copper Beech Portfolio Companion Loan is subordinate in right of payment following a material default under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan.  The Copper Beech Portfolio Companion Loan has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $9,958,546 and accrues interest at a rate of 5.4500% per annum on an actual/360 basis.  GSLP may sell or transfer the Copper Beech Portfolio Companion Loan at any time in its sole discretion.  Certain terms and conditions of the co-lender agreement between the holders of the Copper Beech Portfolio Loan and the Copper
Beech Portfolio Companion Loan, including the rights of the holder of the Copper Beech Portfolio Companion Loan to approve and direct material servicing actions relating to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, replace the special servicer with respect to the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, cure defaults under the Copper Beech Portfolio Loan and the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan and purchase the Copper Beech Portfolio Loan after a material default under the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan, as well as the allocation of collections on the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan between such holders, are described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loan—The Copper Beech Portfolio Co-Lender Agreement” in the Free Writing Prospectus.



 




n


Terrorism Insurance.  So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance for foreign and domestic acts (as those terms are defined in TRIPRA or similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrowers are required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Copper Beech Portfolio Whole Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrowers will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at that time in respect of the casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the loan
documents (not including the terrorism, seismic and business interruption components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrowers are required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to have a deductible that is not in excess of $50,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrowers provide evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Copper Beech Portfolio Properties are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Appraisal.  According to the appraisal, the Hyatt Regency Boston Property had an “as is” appraised value of $151,000,000 as of an effective date of June 3, 2011. The Hyatt Regency Boston Property has an “as stabilized” appraised value of $177,000,000 as of an effective date of June 3, 2014 which assumes a stabilized occupancy of 82.0%.




 




n


Environmental Matters.  The Phase I report dated June 29, 2011, recommended that a mold prevention plan be prepared to prevent future mold issues at the Hyatt Regency Boston Property as areas of water intrusion were observed in the following areas: commercial kitchen ceiling tiles (the area affected by the moisture was approximately two square feet in size, in four areas); the telephone room ceiling tiles (the area affected by the moisture was approximately one square foot in size, in three locations); and the ejector pit sidewalk vault (the concrete ceiling area affected by the moisture resulting from water penetration through City of Boston owned brick pavers was approximately ten square feet in size in five locations). Per the Phase I, the sources of moisture at the kitchen and telephone room have been addressed, and the estimated cost to replace the damaged
finishes is $495 and the work can be performed as part of the property management's routine maintenance program. Per the environmental report, the water intrusion within the sewage ejector pit sidewalk vault occurs through the exterior pavement, and the brick paver pavement requires repairs to prevent additional water intrusion. Per the environmental report, the pavement is owned and maintained by the City of Boston. The environmental report recommends that the Hyatt Regency Boston Property management contact city officials to perform an inspection and provide a scope of work for repairs.

Escrows.  At origination, the borrower funded an escrow reserve in the amount of $1,715,000 in respect of a property improvement plan relating to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property (as described in “—Property Improvement Plan and Capital Plan” below).  On each due date, the borrower is required to fund: (i) a tax and insurance reserve (but no reserves for insurance premiums are required so long as the Hyatt Regency Boston Property is covered by a blanket policy, and no reserves for taxes are required so long as the property manager is reserving sufficient funds for the payment of taxes and actually paying taxes on or before the date they become due and payable); and (ii) a reserve for furniture, fixtures and equipment in an amount equal to 4% of the borrower’s monthly operating income for the period prior to December
31, 2011 and in an amount equal to 5% of the borrower’s monthly operating income thereafter (but no such reserve is required to the extent that the borrower funds a reserve in the same amount pursuant to the hotel management agreement and such reserve is subject to an account control agreement in favor of lender, pursuant to which lender has the right to control the disbursement of funds from such account upon termination of the hotel management agreement).  In addition, if borrower fails to complete the work under a capital plan applicable to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property before June 30, 2013, a reserve in respect of the capital plan work (as described in “—Property Improvement Plan and Capital Plan” below) is required to be funded from excess cash that would otherwise be distributed to borrower from the cash management account, until such reserve contains the greater of (a)
$1,000,000 and (b) an amount equal to $5,000,000 minus the amounts already expended by borrower in respect of the capital plan work.




 
Furthermore, during the continuance of a Hyatt Regency Boston Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all amounts on deposit in the cash management account, after the payment of debt service and the funding of required monthly escrows be reserved and held as additional collateral for the Hyatt Regency Boston Loan.
 
A “Hyatt Regency Boston Trigger Period” means any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is less than $8,036,012.20 and terminating as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is greater than or equal to $8,036,012.20. Additionally, a Hyatt Regency Boston Trigger Period will exist as of the date that borrower fails to complete any portion of the work under the property improvement plan applicable to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property by the deadline for such work set forth in the loan agreement until the date that the applicable portion of the work
under property improvement plan has been completed.
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  All credit card receivables, all cash revenues and all other money received by borrower, the operating lessee or the property manager with respect to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property are required to be deposited into an operating account established by the property manager pursuant to the hotel management agreement and subject to an account control agreement in favor of lender, pursuant to which lender has the right to control the disbursement of funds from such account upon termination of the hotel management agreement.  Subject to the terms of the hotel management agreement, the property manager is required to pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property and all other amounts required or permitted to be paid by the property manager in the performance of its duties and obligations with respect
to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property (including all management fees payable to the property manager) out of operating account or the FF&E account maintained by the property manager.  All amounts required to be paid by the property manager to borrower or operating lessee under the hotel management agreement must instead be remitted to a cash management account under the control of lender.  On each business day that no event of default under the Hyatt Regency Boston Loan or Hyatt Regency Boston Trigger Period is continuing, all funds in the cash management account in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an account owned and controlled by borrower.

Property Management.  The Hyatt Regency Boston Property is currently managed by Hyatt Corporation, a third-party property manager, pursuant to a hotel management agreement.  Under the loan documents, the Hyatt Regency Boston Property may be managed by Hyatt Corporation or any other management company approved by lender and with respect to which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.  During the continuance of a material default by the property manager under the hotel management agreement (after the expiration of any applicable notice and/or cure periods), or the filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event, lender has the right to require borrower to exercise any and all available remedies under the hotel management agreement, and if the exercise of such remedies results in the termination of the property manager, engage replacement property manager reasonably acceptable to lender.



 




n


Mezzanine or Subordinate Indebtedness.  Not permitted



 




n


Terrorism Insurance. So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrower is required to maintain terrorism insurance for foreign and domestic acts (as such terms are defined in TRIPRA or similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property (plus twelve months of business interruption coverage).  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower is required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Hyatt Regency Boston Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in such event the borrower will not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required
under the loan documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the borrower must purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount.  In either such case, terrorism insurance shall not have a deductible in excess of $50,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Hyatt Regency Boston Property are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.



 




n


Reversionary Deed Agreement.  The borrower’s fee interest in the Hyatt Regency Boston Property was acquired pursuant to a deed in which title to the Hyatt Regency Boston Property automatically reverts to the City of Boston in 2079.  The borrower's fee interest  in the Hyatt Regency Boston Property covers the surface of the parcel and the air rights above it, with the subterranean rights to the parking garage beneath the Hyatt Regency Boston Property owned by the City of Boston, subject to easements to the parking garage granted to borrower.  The City of Boston has no remedy or right under the deed that could accelerate its right of reverter or otherwise cause borrower’s interest in the Hyatt Regency Boston Property to otherwise be materially decreased, encumbered, impaired, modified, transferred or terminated; nonetheless, if for any reason borrower’s interest in the Hyatt Regency Boston
Property pursuant to the deed terminates prior to 2079, the City of Boston is required under the deed to take all necessary action to revert title to borrower.  Upon a foreclosure, the lender would succeed to borrower’s fee interest in the Hyatt Regency Boston Property and all of borrower rights and privileges under the deed.

Operating Lease.  An affiliate of the borrower, CHSP TRS Boston II LLC (“Operating Lessee”), leases the Hyatt Regency Boston Property from the borrower pursuant to a lease agreement dated March 18, 2010 (the “Operating Lease”), which Operating Lease is pledged to the lender as additional collateral for the Hyatt Regency Boston Loan under the mortgage. The Operating Lessee is the party to the hotel management agreement; however, amounts payable to the Operating Lessee by the property manager under the hotel management agreement are required to be deposited directly to the cash management account under the control of the lender as described in the Lockbox and Cash Management section above.  The Operating Lessee has joined in the execution of the loan agreement.  The lender
may terminate the Operating Lease in its sole discretion upon a foreclosure of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property.  Pursuant to a subordination and nondisturbance agreement, following a foreclosure on the Hyatt Regency Boston Property, the property manager has agreed to recognize any subsequent owner of the Hyatt Regency Boston Property as the “owner” under the hotel management agreement.



 




n

In addition, the loan documents require the completion of the following capital improvements prior to July 1, 2013: (i) the replacement of the carpets, lighting and vinyl wall coverings on all guestroom floor corridors at the Hyatt Regency Boston Property and (ii) with respect to each guestroom at the Hyatt Regency Boston Property where such replacements were not made in conjunction with the property improvement

The Mortgage Loan.  The mortgage loan (the “Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan”) is evidenced by a note in the original principal amount of $95,000,000 and is secured by a first mortgage encumbering Parkdale Mall, a regional mall and Parkdale Crossing, a strip center adjacent to Parkdale Mall located in Beaumont, Texas (the “Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property”).  The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan was originated by Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital, L.P. and was subsequently purchased by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company.  The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan was originated on March 3, 2011 and represents approximately 5.4% of the Initial Pool Balance.  The note evidencing the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan had an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $94,003,560 and has an interest
rate of 5.8500% per annum on a 30/360 basis.  The borrower utilized the proceeds of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan to refinance existing debt on the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property.



 
The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan had an initial term of 120 months and has a remaining term of 113 months.  The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan requires payments of principal and interest in an amount sufficient to fully amortize the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan over a 25-year amortization schedule.  The scheduled maturity date is the due date in March 2021.  Voluntary prepayment of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan is prohibited prior to December 6, 2020.  Defeasance with direct, non-callable AAA-rated obligations that are either the direct obligations of, or are fully guaranteed by the full faith and credit of, the United States of America is permitted at any time on or after the first due date following the second anniversary of the securitization closing date.

PARKDALE MALL & CROSSING




 




n


The Borrower.  The borrowers are Parkdale Mall CMBS, LLC and Parkdale Crossing CMBS, LLC, each a single-purpose, single-asset entity.  Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan.  The borrower of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan is indirectly owned by CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., who is also the non-recourse carveout guarantor under the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan.



 




n


Escrows. At origination, the borrower funded a reserve on the amount of $323,450 in respect of certain unfunded obligations at the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property.  On each due date, provided no event of default under the loan documents is occurring, the borrower is required to fund (i) a tax and insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax and insurance premiums over the then succeeding twelve month period, (ii) a tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve in the monthly amount of $48,316 and (iii) a capital expenditure reserve in the monthly amount of $14,518.



 
Furthermore, during the continuance of a Parkdale Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all amounts on deposit in the lockbox account, after the payment of debt service and the funding of required monthly escrows for budgeted operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital expenditures, be reserved and held as additional collateral for the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan.
 
A “Parkdale Trigger Period” means any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is less than $9,757,345.60 and terminating as of the end of the second fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property for the twelve-month period immediately preceding such fiscal quarter end is greater than or equal to $9,757,345.60.
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to lender-controlled lockbox accounts.  The loan documents also require that all rents received by the borrower or the property manager be deposited into the lockbox account or a blocked account within one business day after receipt.  So long as no event of default or Parkdale Trigger Period is then continuing, all amounts in the lockbox accounts are swept on a daily basis to an operating account accessible by borrower but pledged to lender.  During the continuance of an event of default or Parkdale Trigger Period, all amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-owned cash management account, rather than to the borrower.  During the continuance of an event of default under the Parkdale Mall
& Crossing Loan, the lender may prohibit borrower’s access to the funds contained in the operating account and apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management.  The Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property is currently managed by CBL & Associates Management, Inc., an affiliate of the borrower, pursuant to two management agreements.  Under the loan documents, the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property may not be managed by any other party, other than (i) any direct or indirect wholly-owned affiliate of CBL & Associates Management, Inc. or CBL & Associates Limited Partnership or (ii) another management company approved by the lender and with respect to which the Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a material default by the property manager under the management agreements beyond any applicable cure period or the filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to the property manager, the lender may require the borrower to replace
the property manager with a new property manager selected by the lender and with respect to which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.



 




n


Mezzanine or Subordinate Indebtedness.  No mezzanine financing is permitted, however, issuance of preferred equity in borrower is permitted subject to requirements set forth in the loan documents, including qualifications for the holder of any such preferred equity, subordination of such preferred equity to all payments required under the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan and Rating Agency Confirmation.

n


Release of Collateral.  The borrower may obtain the release of a certain vacant, non-income producing parcel identified in the loan agreement, in connection with the conveyance (or ground lease) of such parcels to one or more third parties, without the payment of a release price, subject to certain conditions set forth in the loan agreement, including among others: (i) no event of default continuing under the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan, (ii) a determination that certain REMIC requirements will be met and (iii) delivery of Rating Agency Confirmation.



 




n


Terrorism Insurance.  So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrower is required to maintain terrorism insurance for certified and non-certified acts (as those terms are defined in TRIPRA or similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower is required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrower will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at that time in respect of the casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under
the loan documents, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is no larger than $100,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Parkdale Mall & Crossing Property are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

The Borrower.  The borrower is Chino Hills Mall LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a single-purpose, single-asset entity.  Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Shoppes at Chino Hills Loan.  The borrower of the Shoppes at Chino Hills Loan is a Delaware limited liability company, (i) the members of which are two trusts in which the trustees are Manouchehr Moshayedi and Mehrdad Moshayedi, respectively, and (ii) the limited liability company managers of which are Manouchehr Moshayedi and Mehrdad Moshayedi.  Manouchehr and Mehrdad Moshayedi’s other real estate holdings include a 45,000 SF grocery anchored shopping center in Van Nuys, California, a 40 unit medical office building and drugstore in Monton, Canada, a 40 unit multifamily property in Oromocto New Brunswick, Canada and various other residential/condominium developments.  The
non-recourse carveout guarantors under the Shoppes at Chino Hills Loan are Manouchehr Moshayedi and Mehrdad Moshayedi.  The guarantors are currently the subject of an SEC investigation concerning their 2009 sale, in a secondary public offering, of stock in a public company they co-founded and in which they were officers.  The guarantors have indicated that they are cooperating with the investigation.  The guarantors are also defendants in two lawsuits related to the secondary public offering and other matters.  See “Risk Factors—Litigation Regarding the Mortgaged Properties or Borrowers May Impair Your Distributions” and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Litigation Considerations” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

The Borrower.  The borrower is 5757 Wilshire LLC, a single-purpose, single-asset entity.  Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Museum Square Loan.  The borrower of the Museum Square Loan is indirectly owned, in part, by Jerome H. Snyder and William Glikbarg, who are also the non-recourse carveout guarantors under the Museum Square Loan.



 




n


Escrows.  At origination, the borrower funded an escrow reserve in the amount of $238,797 in respect of certain tax expenses and $44,529 in respect of certain insurance premiums.  On each due date, the borrowers are required to fund a tax, insurance and assessments reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax, insurance premiums and fire safety assessments over the then succeeding twelve month period.  In addition, at origination, the borrower deposited $3,015,506 into a reserve account to cover certain unfunded obligations of the borrower in respect of certain tenant improvements and leasing commissions.  During the continuance of a Museum Square Trigger Period, the borrower is required to establish a tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve and fund that reserve either (a) in a monthly amount of $10,960 or (b) in an annual amount of $789,072
minus any funds on deposit in that reserve attributable to the then-current twelve month period.  During the continuance of a Museum Square Trigger Period, the borrower is required to establish a capital expenditures reserve and fund that reserve either (a) in a monthly amount of $65,756 or (b) in an annual amount of $131,520 minus any funds on deposit in that reserve attributable to the then-current twelve month period.  Upon termination of a Museum Square Trigger Period, provided no event of default is then continuing, amounts on deposit in the tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve and the capital expenditures reserve are required to be remitted to the borrower.  In addition, the borrower is required to establish a reserve account for the deposit of any casualty or condemnation loss proceeds.

MUSEUM SQUARE




 
A “Museum Square Trigger Period” means (a) any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the Museum Square Property for the prior twelve-month period is less than $6,710,053.70 and terminating as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Museum Square Property for the prior twelve-month period is equal to or greater than $6,710,053.70 or (b) any period commencing when the borrower fails to deliver certain financial reports to the lender as required under the loan agreement and terminating when such reports are so delivered.
 




n


Release of Collateral.  Provided no event of default is then continuing under the Museum Square Loan, from and after the four month anniversary of the origination date, the borrower may obtain the release of an unimproved outparcel from the lien of the loan documents, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including among others: (i) after giving effect to the release, the loan-to-value ratio (as calculated pursuant to the loan documents) for the remaining portions of the Museum Square Property is no greater than 50% and (iii) delivery of Rating Agency Confirmation.



 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Museum Square Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled cash management account or a blocked account.  The loan documents also require that all rents received by the borrower or the property manager be deposited into the cash management account or a blocked account within one business day after receipt.  All amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on a daily basis.  On each business day that no event of default under the Museum Square Loan is continuing, all funds in the cash management account in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an operating account designated and accessible by the borrower and pledged to the lender.  During
the continuance of an event of default under the Museum Square Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the Museum Square Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of the Museum Square Property, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management.  The Museum Square Property is currently managed by Museum Square Management Company, an affiliate of the borrower, pursuant to a management agreement.  Under the loan documents, the Museum Square Property may not be managed by any other party, except for a management company approved by the lender and with respect to which a Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.  The lender may require the borrower to replace the property manager if there is a material default by the property manager under the management agreement, the filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to the property manager or if an event of default under the Museum Square Loan has occurred and is continuing.



 




n


Mezzanine or Subordinate Indebtedness.  Not permitted.



 




n


Terrorism Insurance. So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrower is required to maintain terrorism insurance for certified acts and non-certified acts (as such terms are defined in TRIPRA or such similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Museum Square Property, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower is required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Museum Square Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrower will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under
the loan documents (not including the terrorism and earthquake components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is approved by the lender and is no larger than $50,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Museum Square Property are separately allocated under such blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Escrows. At origination, the borrowers deposited $46,677 into a reserve account to cover certain deferred maintenance conditions at the Cole Portfolio Properties.  In addition, at origination, the borrower deposited $27,500 into a reserve account to cover certain unfunded obligations of the borrower in respect of certain leasing commissions.  On each due date, the borrowers are required to fund a tax and insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax and insurance premiums over the then succeeding twelve month period, unless the borrowers provide evidence of payment of the related taxes and/or premiums.  In addition, the borrower is required to establish a reserve account for the deposit of casualty or condemnation loss proceeds exceeding the lesser of $200,000 or 10% of the applicable allocated loan amount.



 
Furthermore, during the continuance of an event of default or a Cole Portfolio Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all amounts on deposit in the lockbox account, after the payment of debt service and the funding of required monthly escrows for real estate taxes and insurance be reserved and held as additional collateral for the Cole Portfolio Loan.
 
A “Cole Portfolio Trigger Period” means, on or prior to the anticipated repayment date, any 12-month period as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income (as defined in the loan agreement) of the Cole Portfolio Properties for the prior twelve-month period is less than or equal to $5,652,500 and terminating as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the net operating income of the Cole Portfolio Properties for the prior twelve-month period is greater than $5,652,500.
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Cole Portfolio Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrowers to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender controlled cash management account or a blocked account.  The loan documents also require that all rents received by the borrowers or the property manager be deposited into the lender controlled cash management account or a blocked account within two business days after receipt.  All amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on a daily basis.  On each business day that no event of default under the Cole Portfolio Loan is continuing, no Cole Portfolio Trigger Period is continuing and the anticipated repayment date has not occurred, all funds in the lender-controlled cash management account in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required
reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an account designated by the borrowers.  During the continuance of an event of default under the Cole Portfolio Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the lender controlled lockbox account to the obligations of the borrowers under the Cole Portfolio Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of the Cole Portfolio Properties, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management.  The Cole Portfolio Properties are currently managed by Cole Realty Advisors, Inc., an affiliate of the borrowers, pursuant to a management agreement.  Under the loan documents, the Cole Portfolio Properties may not be managed by any other party, except for a management company approved by the lender and with respect to which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing, a material default relating to any of the Cole Portfolio Properties by the property manager or the filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to the property manager, the lender may require the borrowers to replace the property manager with respect to the applicable Cole Portfolio Properties or the lender may request that the existing property manager enter into a new management agreement that relates to the applicable Cole Portfolio Properties.



 




n


Hyperamortization Summary.  The Cole Portfolio loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date of May 6, 2021 and a final maturity date of May 6, 2041.  In the event that the Cole Portfolio Loan is not paid off on or before the anticipated repayment date, the interest rate will automatically increase to the greater of (i) the initial interest rate plus 300 basis points and (ii) the swap rate as of the anticipated repayment date plus 300 basis points (the “Adjusted Interest Rate”); but in no event may the Adjusted Interest Rate exceed the initial interest rate plus 500 basis points.  After the anticipated repayment date, interest will be due and payable at the initial interest rate and additional interest attributable to the Adjusted Interest Rate will be deferred and added to the outstanding principal balance as of each due date.  Additionally,
after the Anticipated Repayment Date, all excess

cash will be used to hyperamortize the Cole Portfolio Loan. If the borrowers do not repay the Cole Portfolio Loan in full on the anticipated repayment date, the estimated balance of the Cole Portfolio Loan upon the final maturity date would be approximately $18,398,243 with an interest rate of 5.9230%, 20-year loan term and 20-year amortization term, assuming the Adjusted Interest Rate is the initial interest rate plus 300 basis points (8.9230%) and no excess cash flow is used to paydown the outstanding principal balance. The final maturity loan-to-value ratio based on the estimated final maturity balance of $18,398,243 and the appraised value of $86,675,000 is 21.2%.
 





n


Release of Collateral.  Provided no event of default is then continuing under the Cole Portfolio Loan, at any time on or after the first due date following the second anniversary of the securitization closing date, the borrowers may obtain the release of one or more of the Cole Portfolio Properties from the liens of the loan documents, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including among others: (i) delivery of defeasance collateral sufficient to defease an amount equal to (a) 120% of the allocated loan amount for each Cole Portfolio Property being released in the case of each CVS property, the Volusia Square property, and the Shoppes at Port Arthur property and (b) 115% of the allocated loan amount for each Cole Portfolio Property being released in the case of each other Cole Portfolio Property, (ii) after giving effect to the release, the debt service coverage ratio (as
calculated under the loan agreement) for the remaining Cole Portfolio Properties for the twelve-month period preceding the end of the most recent fiscal quarter is equal to or greater than the greater of (a) 2.37x and (b) the debt service coverage ratio immediately prior to the release and (iii) delivery of Rating Agency Confirmation.



 




n


Mezzanine or Subordinate Indebtedness.  Not permitted.



 




n


Terrorism Insurance.  So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance for certified and non-certified acts (as those terms are defined in TRIPRA or such similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Cole Portfolio Properties, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrowers are required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Cole Portfolio Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrowers will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at that time in respect of the casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the loan documents
(not including the terrorism components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrowers are required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is acceptable to the lender and is no larger than $50,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrowers provide evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Cole Portfolio Properties are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Appraisal.  According to the appraisal, the Ashland Town Center Property had an “as-is” appraised value of $66,000,000 as of an effective date of April 6, 2011. The appraiser also indicated an “as stabilized” appraised value of $70,000,000 as of an effective date of May 1, 2012 which assumes the lease up of vacant junior anchor space.

Environmental Matters.  The Phase I report dated April 12, 2011 recommended a Phase II Environmental Assessment to evaluate areas of the site for diesel range contamination. The Phase II concluded that soil and groundwater in one boring were impacted above Kentucky cleanup standards for storage tanks and surface releases. Based on discussion with the Kentucky Superfund program, since this contamination is related to historic use, it is not specifically required to be reported. However, it is recommended that regulatory closure for the contamination be obtained through a managed closure, which would entail applying an environmental covenant to the property to restrict potential exposure to the contamination. The environmental consultant estimates costs associated with the required delineation of the contamination and pursuit of the managed site closure including
deed restriction would be in the range of $30,000-$40,000 and could be completed within one year. At origination, the borrower deposited $40,000 into a reserve account to cover additional testing to

Lockbox and Cash Management.  The Ashland Town Center Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled cash management account or a blocked account.  The loan documents also require that the borrower cause all cash revenues relating to the Ashland Town Center Property and all other money received by the borrower or the property manager with respect to the Ashland Town Center Property to be deposited into the cash management account or blocked account by the end of the first business day following receipt.  All amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on each business day.  On each business day that no event of default under the Ashland Town Center Loan is continuing and no Ashland Town Center Trigger Period is continuing, all funds in the cash
management accounts in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an account designated by the borrower.  During the continuance of an event of default under the Ashland Town Center Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the Ashland Town Center Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of Ashland Town Center Property, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management.  The Ashland Town Center Property is currently managed by Glimcher Properties Limited Partnership, as manager, and Glimcher Development Corporation, as services provider, each of which are affiliates of the borrower, pursuant to a management agreement.  Under the loan documents, the Ashland Town Center Property may not be managed by any other party, other than a management company approved by the lender and with respect to which Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.  The lender may require the borrower to replace the property manager if there is a material default by the property manager under the management agreement after the expiration of any applicable cure period, if an event of default under the Ashland Town Center Loan has occurred and is continuing or upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the occurrence of a similar event with respect to the property
manager.

Terrorism Insurance.  So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrower is required to maintain terrorism insurance for foreign and domestic acts (as those terms are defined in TRIPRA or similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Ashland Town Center Property, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower is required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Ashland Town Center Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrower will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at that time in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the loan documents (not
including the terrorism and earthquake components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is approved by the lender and is no larger than $100,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the Ashland Town Center Property are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

The Borrower.  The borrower is Appletree Realty Holdings, LLC, a single-purpose, single-asset entity.  Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the AppleTree Business Park Loan.  AmCap, Incorporated is the non-recourse carveout guarantor under the AppleTree Business Park Loan.  Additionally, Jay A. Kaiser is also a guarantor with respect to certain of the non-recourse carveouts.



 




n


Escrows.  On each due date, the borrower is required to fund a tax and insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount the lender estimates will be necessary to pay tax and insurance premiums over the then succeeding twelve month period, other than taxes paid by certain tenants and unless, in the case of the insurance premiums, the borrower provides evidence that the required insurance is being provided under a blanket policy and premiums for the policy year have been paid in full in advance.  In addition, at origination, the borrower deposited (i) $1,500,000 into a reserve account in respect of certain tenant improvements and leasing commissions, (ii) $750,000 into a lease renewal reserve account in respect of the smaller lease space occupied by the IRS (GSA), (iii) $500,000 into a lease renewal reserve account in respect of the lease space occupied by Catholic Health Care System and (iv) $92,730
into a reserve account for certain deferred maintenance conditions.



 
In addition, on each due date, the borrower is required to fund (i) a capital expenditure reserve in the monthly amount of $13,967 and (ii) a tenant improvements and leasing commissions reserve in the monthly amount of (x) $1,500,000 minus the then-existing balance of the reserve, divided by (y) the number of months for which the existing IRS (GSA) lease is renewed or for the term of any new lease entered for the larger lease space occupied by the IRS (GSA), subject to a maximum total escrowed amount of $1,500,000.  Further, the borrower is required to deposit any termination fee it receives in connection with the termination of a lease into the tenant improvements and leasing commissions account up to an amount equal to $25.00 psf times the rentable SF subject to the termination.  In addition, the borrower is required to establish a reserve account for the deposit of casualty or condemnation loss proceeds.

Furthermore, during the continuance of a AppleTree Business Park Trigger Period, the loan documents require that all amounts on deposit in the cash management account, after the payment of debt service and budgeted operating expenses and the funding of required monthly escrows for real estate taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and tenant improvements and leasing commissions, be reserved and held as additional collateral for the AppleTree Business Park Loan.
 
An “AppleTree Business Park Trigger Period” means (i) any period commencing as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which the debt service coverage ratio (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the AppleTree Business Park Property for the prior twelve-month period is less than 1.20x and terminating as of the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters in which the debt service coverage ratio (as calculated under the loan agreement) of the AppleTree Business Park Property for the prior twelve-month period is greater than 1.20x or (ii) any period commencing when the borrower fails to deliver certain financial reports to the lender as required under the loan agreement and terminating when such reports are so delivered.
 




n


Lockbox and Cash Management.  The AppleTree Business Park Loan requires a hard lockbox, which is already in place.  The loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled cash management account or a blocked account.  The loan documents also require that the borrower cause all cash revenues relating to the AppleTree Business Park Property and all other money received by the borrower or the property manager with respect to the AppleTree Business Park Property to be deposited into the cash management account or blocked account by the end of the first business day following receipt.  All amounts in any blocked account are swept to the lender-controlled cash management account on each business day.  On each business day that no event of default under the AppleTree Business Park Loan is continuing and no AppleTree Business Park Trigger Period is continuing,
all funds in the cash management accounts in excess of the amount required to pay debt service and fund required reserves on the next due date will be remitted to an account maintained by the borrower in respect of operating expenses for the AppleTree Business Park Property.  During the continuance of an event of default under the AppleTree Business Park Loan, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under the AppleTree Business Park Loan and/or toward the payment of expenses of AppleTree Business Park Property, in such order of priority as the lender may determine.



 




n


Property Management.  The AppleTree Business Park Property is currently managed by AmCap, Incorporated, an affiliate of the borrower, pursuant to a management agreement.  Under the loan documents, the AppleTree Business Park Property may not be managed by any other party, other than a management company reasonably approved by the lender and with respect to which a Rating Agency Confirmation has been received.  The lender may require the borrower to replace the property manager if there is a material default by the property manager under the management agreement after the expiration of any applicable cure period, if an event of default under the AppleTree Business Park Loan has occurred and is continuing or upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the occurrence of a similar event with respect to the property manager.



 




n


Hyperamortization Summary. The AppleTree Business Park Loan has an initial scheduled maturity date of July 6, 2021.  The borrower is permitted to extend the initial scheduled maturity date for one year upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to $50,000.  In the event that the borrower exercises its option to extend the initial scheduled maturity date, the interest rate will automatically increase to the greater of (i) the initial interest rate plus 200 basis points and (ii) the swap rate as of the initial scheduled maturity date plus 410 basis points (the “Adjusted Interest Rate”).  After the initial scheduled maturity date, interest will be due and payable at the initial interest rate and additional interest attributable to the Adjusted Interest Rate will be deferred and added to the
outstanding principal balance (although the deferred interest may not bear interest) as of each due date.  Additionally, after the initial scheduled maturity date, all excess cash will be used to hyperamortize the AppleTree Business Park Loan. Provided that the borrowers do not repay the AppleTree Business Park Loan in full on the scheduled initial maturity date, the estimated balance of the AppleTree Business Park Loan upon the extended maturity date would be approximately $31,694,886 with an interest rate of 5.6660%, 1-year loan term and 20-year amortization term, assuming the Adjusted Interest Rate is the initial interest rate plus 200 basis points (7.6660%) and no excess cash flow is used to paydown the outstanding

Terrorism Insurance.  So long as TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is in effect, the borrower is required to maintain terrorism insurance for certified and non-certified acts (as those terms are defined in TRIPRA or similar or subsequent statute) in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the AppleTree Business Park Property, plus twelve months of business interruption coverage.  If TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the borrower is required to carry terrorism insurance throughout the term of the AppleTree Business Park Loan as required by the preceding sentence, but in that event the borrower will not be required to spend more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at that time in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the loan
documents (not including the terrorism and earthquake components of that insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds that amount, the borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to that amount.  The terrorism insurance is required to contain a deductible that is approved by the lender and is no larger than $50,000.  The required terrorism insurance may be included in a blanket policy, provided that the borrower provides evidence satisfactory to the lender that the insurance premiums for the AppleTree Business Park Property are separately allocated under the blanket policy and that certain other requirements are satisfied.  See “Risk Factors—Terrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Easy Spirit and Gap pay only percentage rent, although a minimum base rent is specified in their leases, and Nine West and Timberland pay percentage rent with no minimum rent (Timberland switches to fixed rent in October 2011 - $31.00 psf).  For underwriting purposes, the current rent for these four tenants ($525,573) is included in base rent and the above $219,860 reflects only the overage rent being paid by tenants that have exceeded the sales break points specified in their leases.

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS



 
Investors should review the Free Writing Prospectus and the Base Prospectus, including the description of risk factors contained in the Free Writing Prospectus and the Base Prospectus, prior to making a decision to invest in the certificates offered by this Term Sheet.  The Free Writing Prospectus and the Base Prospectus will include more complete descriptions of the risks described below as well as additional risks relating to, among other things, risks related to specific mortgage loans and specific property types.  Any decision to invest in the offered certificates should be made after reviewing the Free Writing Prospectus and the Base Prospectus, conducting such investigations as the investor deems necessary and consulting the investor’s own legal, accounting and tax advisors in order to make an independent determination of the suitability and consequences of an investment in the offered certificates.  Capitalized terms
used but not defined in this Term Sheet shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Free Writing Prospectus or, if not defined therein, in the Base Prospectus.
 




n


The Volatile Economy, Credit Crisis and Downturn in the Real Estate Market Have Adversely Affected and May Continue to Adversely Affect the Value of CMBS



 




—


In recent years, the real estate and securitization markets, including the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), as well as global financial markets and the economy generally, have experienced significant dislocations, illiquidity and volatility.  We cannot assure you that a dislocation in the CMBS market will not re-occur or become more severe.



 




n


The Offered Certificates May Not Be A Suitable Investment for You



 




—


The offered certificates are not suitable investments for all investors.  In particular, you should not purchase any class of offered certificates unless you understand and are able to bear the risk that the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the offered certificates are subject to material variability from period to period and give rise to the potential for significant loss over the life of the offered certificates.



 




—


An investment in the offered certificates should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate due diligence on the mortgage loans and the offered certificates.



 




n


The Offered Certificates Are Limited Obligations



 




—


The offered certificates, when issued, will represent beneficial interests in the issuing entity.  The offered certificates will not represent an interest in, or obligation of, the sponsors, the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor, the certificate administrator, the trustee, the underwriters, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other person.



 




—


The primary assets of the issuing entity will be the notes evidencing the mortgage loans, and the primary security and source of payment for the mortgage loans will be the mortgaged properties and the other collateral described in the Free Writing Prospectus.  Payments on the offered certificates are expected to be derived from payments made by the borrowers on the mortgage loans.



 




n


Mortgage Loans Are Nonrecourse and Are Not Insured or Guaranteed



 




—


The mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by any person or entity, governmental or otherwise.



 




—


Investors should treat each mortgage loan as a nonrecourse loan.  If a default occurs, recourse generally may be had only against the specific properties and other assets that have been pledged to secure the loan.  Consequently, payment prior to maturity is dependent primarily on the sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property.  Payment at maturity is primarily dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to refinance the mortgaged property.



 




n


The Certificates May Have Limited Liquidity and the Market Value of the Certificates May Decline



 




—


Your certificates will not be listed on any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association, and there is currently no secondary market for your certificates.  While we have been advised by the underwriters that one or more of them, or one or more of their affiliates, currently intend to make a market in the offered certificates, none of the underwriters has any obligation to do so, any market-making may be discontinued at any time, and we cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the offered certificates will develop.



 




—


The market value of the offered certificates will also be influenced by the supply of and demand for CMBS generally. The supply of CMBS will depend on, among other things, the amount of commercial and multifamily mortgage loans, whether newly originated or held in the portfolios that are available for securitization.



 




n


Legal and Regulatory Provisions Affecting Investors Could Adversely Affect the Liquidity of the Offered Certificates



 




—


Except as regards their status under the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended, we make no representation as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the offered certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions.  We note that regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire CMBS, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the offered certificates who are not subject to those provisions to resell their certificates in the secondary market.

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS (continued)



 




—


Member States of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) are in the process of implementing new Article 122a of the Banking Consolidation Directive (Directive 2006/48/EC, as amended) (“Article 122a”), which applies to new securitizations issued on or after December 31, 2010 and in certain circumstances, to securitizations issued prior to that date. Among other provisions, Article 122a restricts investments by an EEA regulated credit institution (and in some cases, consolidated group entities) in securitizations that fail to comply with certain requirements concerning retention by the originator, sponsor or original lender of the securitized assets of a portion of the securitization’s credit risk.  Additionally, Article 122a imposes a severe capital charge on a securitization’s securities acquired by an EEA regulated credit institution if that
securitization fails to meet the requirements of Article 122a.  None of the originators, the sponsors, the depositor or the issuing entity have taken, or intend to take, any steps to comply with the requirements of Article 122a.  The fact that the offered certificates have not been structured to comply with Article 122a is likely to limit the ability of an EEA-regulated credit institution to purchase offered certificates, which in turn may adversely affect the liquidity of the offered certificates in the secondary market.  This could adversely affect your ability to transfer offered certificates or the price you may receive upon your sale of offered certificates.



 




—


The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the United States requires that federal banking regulators amend their regulations such that capital charges imposed on banking institutions are determined to a lesser extent on the ratings of their investments.  When such regulations are adopted, investments in CMBS by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own CMBS, or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of CMBS for regulatory capital purposes.



 




—


The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products.  These changes, or any future changes, may affect the accounting for entities such as the issuing entity, could under certain circumstances require an investor or its owner generally to consolidate the assets of the issuing entity in its financial statements and record third parties’ investments in the trust fund as liabilities of that investor or owner or could otherwise adversely affect the manner in which the investor or its owner must report an investment in CMBS for financial reporting purposes.



 




—


For purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended, no class of offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities”.



 




n


Commercial, Multifamily and Manufactured Housing Community Lending is Dependent Upon Net Operating Income



 




—


The repayment of the mortgage loans in the pool will be dependent upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents.  However, net operating income can be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on a mortgage loan at any given time.  The performance and/or value of a particular income-producing real property will depend on a number of variables, including but not limited to property type, geographic location, competition and sponsorship.



 




n


Risks Resulting from Various Concentrations



 




—


The performance of the pool of mortgage loans may be adversely impacted as a result of (i) mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s aggregate principal balance, (ii) a concentration of mortgage loans secured by the same mortgaged property types, (iii) a concentration of mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties located in a particular geographic area, (iv) a concentration of mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties with the same tenant(s) and (v) a concentration of mortgage loans with the same borrower or related borrowers.  The effect of loan pool losses will be more severe if the losses relate to mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s aggregate principal balance.  Likewise, mortgaged properties in which a single tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if that tenant’s
business operations are negatively impacted or if such tenant fails to renew its lease.



 




—


A concentration of related borrowers, mortgaged property types, tenant occupancy or mortgaged properties in similar geographic regions can pose increased risks because a decline in the financial condition of the corporate family of the related borrowers, in a particular industry or business or in a particular geographic area would have a disproportionately large impact on the pool of mortgage loans.



 




n


Borrower May Be Unable To Repay Remaining Principal Balance on Maturity Date or Anticipated Repayment Date



 




—


Mortgage loans with substantial remaining principal balances at their stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date involve greater risk than fully-amortizing mortgage loans.  This is because the borrower may be unable to repay the loan at that time.  A borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable, typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment.



 




n


The Timing of Prepayments and Repurchases May Change Your Anticipated Yield



 




—


We are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experiences of commercial mortgage loans, including both voluntary prepayments, if permitted, and involuntary prepayments, such as prepayments resulting from casualty or condemnation, defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or purchases by a companion loan holder or mezzanine lender pursuant to a purchase option or sales of defaulted mortgage loans.



 




—


Any changes in the weighted average lives of your certificates may adversely affect your yield.



 




—


Each sponsor is the sole warranting party in respect of the mortgage loans sold by such sponsor to the Depositor and the sole party with repurchase/substitution obligations in connection with a material breach of representation and warranty or a material document deficiency. We cannot provide assurances that the applicable sponsor will have the financial ability to repurchase or substitute any mortgage loan sold by it in connection with either a material breach of the applicable sponsor’s representations and warranties or any material document defects.



 


The securities offered by these materials are being offered when, as and if issued.

129





  


 




SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS (continued)



 




n


Litigation Regarding the Mortgaged Properties or Borrowers May Impair Your Distributions



 




—


There may be pending or threatened legal proceedings against the borrowers and the managers of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates arising out of their ordinary business.  Any such litigation may materially impair distributions to certificateholders if borrowers must use property income to pay judgments or litigation costs.  We cannot assure you that any litigation or any settlement of any litigation will not have a material adverse effect on your investment.



 




n


Appraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value of Each Property



 




—


Appraisals were obtained with respect to each of the mortgaged properties at or about the time of origination of the applicable mortgage loan  by the related originator, or at or around the time of the acquisition of the mortgage loan by the related sponsor.  In general, appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present or future value.



 




—


Prospective investors should consider that the information set forth in this Term Sheet regarding appraised values or loan-to-value ratios may not accurately reflect past, present or future market values of the mortgaged properties.  Additionally, with respect to the appraisals setting forth assumptions as to the "as stabilized" values prospective investors should consider that those assumptions may not be accurate and that the "as stabilized" values may not be the values of the related mortgaged properties at maturity.



 




n


Adverse Environmental Conditions at or Near Mortgaged Properties May Result in Losses



 




—


The issuing entity could become liable for a material adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property. Any such potential liability could reduce or delay payments on the offered certificates.



 




—


Although an environmental report was prepared for each mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan in connection with origination, it is possible that the environmental reports and/or supplemental “Phase II” sampling did not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware.  Also, the environmental condition of the mortgaged properties in the future could be affected by the activities of tenants or by third parties unrelated to the borrowers.



 




n


Availability of Earthquake, Flood and Other Insurance



 




—


Although the mortgaged properties are required to be insured, or self-insured by a sole tenant, against certain risks, there is a possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which may result from risks not covered by insurance.



 




—


Even if terrorism insurance is required by the loan documents for a mortgage loan, that requirement may be subject to a cap on the cost of the premium for terrorism insurance that a borrower is required to pay or a commercially reasonable standard on the availability of the insurance.



 




—


We cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts.



 




n


Risks Relating to a Bankruptcy of an Originator, a Sponsor or the Depositor, or a Receivership or Conservatorship of Goldman Sachs Bank USA



 




—


In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of an originator, a sponsor or the Depositor, or a receivership or conservatorship of Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“GS Bank”), it is possible that the issuing entity’s right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans could be challenged. If such challenge is successful, payments on the offered certificates would be reduced or delayed. Even if the challenge is not successful, payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim.



 




—


The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") has adopted a rule, substantially revised and effective January 1, 2011, establishing a safe harbor (the "FDIC Safe Harbor") from its repudiation powers for securitizations meeting the requirements of the rule (12 C.F.R. § 360.6).  The transfers of the applicable mortgage loans by Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (“GSLP”), as an originator, to Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (“GSMC”), as a sponsor, and by GSMC to the depositor, will not qualify for the FDIC Safe Harbor.  However, those transfers are not transfers by a bank, and in any event, even if the FDIC Safe Harbor were applicable to those transfers, the FDIC Safe Harbor is non-exclusive. Additionally, an opinion of counsel will be rendered on the Closing Date to the effect that the
transfers of the applicable mortgage loans by GSLP to GSMC, and by GSMC to the Depositor, would each generally be respected as a sale in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of GSLP or GSMC, as applicable, and therefore beyond the FDIC’s repudiation powers if GS Bank became subject to a receivership or conservatorship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the FDIC, a creditor, bankruptcy trustee or another interested party, including an entity transferring a mortgage loan, as debtor-in-possession, could still attempt to assert that the transfer of a mortgage loan was not a sale. If such party’s challenge is successful, payments on the offered certificates would be reduced or delayed.  Even if the challenge is not successful, payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim.



 




n


Potential Conflicts of Interest of the Sponsors, Underwriters, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Controlling Class Representative and the Whole Loan Directing Holder



 




—


The sponsors, the underwriters, the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor, the Controlling Class Representative, the Whole Loan Directing Holder or any of their respective affiliates may have interests when dealing with the mortgage loans that are in conflict with those of holders of the offered certificates, especially if the sponsors, the underwriters, the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor, the Controlling Class Representative, the Whole Loan Directing Holder or any of their respective affiliates holds certificates or companion loans, or has financial interests in or other financial dealings with a borrower or an affiliate of the borrower.  Each of these relationships may create a conflict of interest and should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered certificates.



 


The securities offered by these materials are being offered when, as and if issued. In particular, you are advised that the offered securities, and the asset pool backing them, are subject to modification or revision (including, among other things, the possibility that one or more classes of securities may be split, combined or eliminated), at any time prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus.

130





  


 




SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS (continued)



 




n


Potential Conflicts of Interest in the Selection of the Underlying Mortgage Loans



 




—


The anticipated initial investor in certain of the subordinate certificates (the “B-Piece Buyer”) was given the opportunity by the sponsors to perform due diligence on the mortgage loans originally identified by the sponsors for inclusion in the issuing entity, and to request the removal, re-sizing or change in the expected repayment dates or other features of some or all of the mortgage loans.  The mortgage pool as originally proposed by the sponsors was adjusted based on some of these requests. Actions of the B-Piece Buyer may be adverse to those of purchasers of classes of offered certificates.



 




n


Interests and Incentives of the Originators, the Sponsors and Their Affiliates May Not Be Aligned With Your Interests



 




—


The originators, the sponsors and their affiliates (including certain of the underwriters) expect to derive ancillary benefits from this offering of offered certificates and their respective incentives may not be aligned with those of purchasers of the offered certificates.  The sponsors originated or purchased the mortgage loans in order to securitize the mortgage loans by means of a transaction such as the offering of the offered certificates.  The sponsors will sell the applicable mortgage loans to the depositor (an affiliate of GSMC, one of the sponsors, and Goldman, Sachs & Co., one of the underwriters) on the Closing Date in exchange for cash, derived from the sale of certificates to investors, and/or in exchange for certificates.  A completed offering would reduce the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans.  The originators made the mortgage loans with a view toward securitizing them and distributing the exposure by
means of a transaction such as this offering of offered certificates.  The offering of offered certificates will effectively transfer the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans to purchasers of the offered certificates.



 




—


The originators are the mezzanine lenders under their respective mezzanine loans.  On the closing date GSLP will be the lender on the companion loan.  The originators may retain the mezzanine loans or the companion loan, as applicable. These transactions may cause the originators and their affiliates or their clients or counterparties who purchase the mezzanine loans or the companion loan, as applicable, to have economic interests and incentives that do not align with, and that may be directly contrary to, those of an investor in the certificates.  In addition, these transactions or actions taken to maintain, adjust or unwind any positions in the future, may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the market for the certificates (if any), including adversely affecting the value of the certificates, particularly in illiquid markets.  The originators, the sponsors and their affiliates will have no obligation to take,
refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to the mezzanine loans or the companion loan, as applicable, based on the potential effect on an investor in the offered certificates, and may receive substantial returns from these transactions.



 




—


The originators, the sponsors and their affiliates expect to receive various benefits, including compensation, commissions, payments, rebates, remuneration and business opportunities in connection with or as a result of this offering of offered certificates and their interests in the mortgage loans.



 




—


Each of the foregoing relationships should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered certificates.



 




n


Interests and Incentives of the Underwriter Entities May Not Be Aligned With Your Interests



 




—


The activities and interests of the underwriters and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Underwriter Entities”) will not align with, and may in fact be directly contrary to, those of the certificateholders.  The Underwriter Entities are part of global investment banking, securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers.



 




—


The Underwriter Entities’ activities include, among other things, executing large block trades and taking long and short positions directly and indirectly, through derivative instruments or otherwise.  The securities and instruments in which the Underwriter Entities take positions, or expect to take positions, include loans similar to the mortgage loans, securities and instruments similar to the offered certificates and other securities and instruments.  Market making is an activity where the Underwriter Entities buy and sell on behalf of customers, or for their own account, to satisfy the expected demand of customers.  By its nature, market making involves facilitating transactions among market participants that have differing views of securities and instruments.  As a result, you should expect that the Underwriter Entities will take positions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of investors in the
offered certificates.

If the Underwriter Entities becomes a holder of any of the certificates, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that they take in their capacity as a certificateholder, including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other holders of the same class or other classes of the certificates.



 




—


In addition, the Underwriter Entities will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the certificates or the actions of the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator or the operating advisor and will have no authority to advise the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator or the operating advisor or to direct their actions.



 




—


Each of the foregoing relationships should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered certificates.



 




n


Other Rating Agencies May Assign Different Ratings to the Certificates



 




—


Other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates. If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you that they will not be different from those ratings assigned by Fitch, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC.  The issuance of unsolicited ratings by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization on one or more classes of the offered certificates that are different from the ratings assigned by Fitch, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC may adversely impact the liquidity and market value of those offered certificates.



 


The securities offered by these materials are being offered when, as and if issued. In particular, you are advised that the offered securities, and the asset pool backing them, are subject to modification or revision (including, among other things, the possibility that one or more classes of securities may be split, combined or eliminated), at any time prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus. As a result, you may commit to purchase securities that have characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of the offered securities may not be issued that have the characteristics described in these materials. Our obligation to sell securities to you is conditioned on the offered securities and the underlying transaction having the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will
notify you, and neither the issuer nor any of the underwriters will have any obligation to you to deliver all or any portion of the securities which you have committed to purchase, and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

The depositor has filed a registration statement (including the prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (SEC File No. 333-171508) for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the depositor has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the depositor, the issuing entity and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS (continued)



 




n


Tax Considerations



 




—


The offered certificates, other than the class R certificates, will be treated as regular interests in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (a "REMIC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



 




—


The class R certificates will be treated as "noneconomic residual interests" in two REMICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Investors in class R certificates will be required to include the taxable income or loss of each REMIC in determining their federal taxable income.



 




—


Special tax considerations may apply to certain types of investors.  Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding tax implications of investment.



 




—


State and local income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding federal law. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the various state and local tax consequences of an investment in the certificates.

	PART I  DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION




	Item 1. Distribution and Pool Performance Information.



	On December 12, 2014, a distribution was made to holders of the certificates issued by GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-GC5.


	The distribution report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-D.


	No assets securitized by GS Mortgage Securities Corporation II (the Depositor) and held by GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-GC5 were the subject
	of a demand to repurchase for breach of the representations and warranties contained in the underlying transaction documents during the distribution period from November 14, 2014 to December 12, 2014.


	The Depositor most recently filed a Form ABS-15G on February 14, 2014. The CIK number of the Depositor is 0001004158. There is no new activity to report
	at this time.


	Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (GSMC), one of the sponsors, most recently filed a Form ABS-15G on November 14, 2014. The
	CIK number of GSMC is 0001541502. There is no new activity to report at this time.


	Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp. (CGMRC), one of the
	sponsors, most recently filed a Form ABS-15G on February 14, 2014. The CIK number of CGMRC is 0001541001. There is no new activity to report at this time.



	PART II  OTHER INFORMATION




	Item 2. Legal
	Proceedings.



	Disclosure from Citibank, N.A., as Certificate Administrator:


	Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is acting as Certificate Administrator of this CMBS transaction. In the ordinary course of business, Citibank is
	involved in a number of legal proceedings, including in connection with its role as trustee of certain RMBS transactions. One such proceeding was a civil action filed against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on
	June 18, 2014 by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for alleged violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty
	and negligence based on Citibanks alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action. On the same day, a smaller subset of similar
	plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank serves as trustee filed a new civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court.


	There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Citibank
	denies liability and intends to vigorously defend against the litigation. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigation nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibanks ability to
	perform its duties as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this CMBS transaction.



	Item 3. Sales of Securities
	and Use of Proceeds.



	None
