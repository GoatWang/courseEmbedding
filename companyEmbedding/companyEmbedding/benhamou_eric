About UsBenhamou Global Ventures (BGV) is an early-stage venture capital firm based in Silicon Valley. Like the talented entrepreneurs we work with we share a passion and commitment for building valuable companies; and especially those that drive the digital transformation of enterprises. 
We place particular emphasis on cloud technologies; virtual and software defined networking; productivity-based applications; cyber security, mobility and the Internet of Things. These companies will already have a product or proof of concept validated  by a few customers and seek the expertise of the BGV team to fine tune and scale their marketing and sales plans. Targeted opportunities will tend to exploit three fundamental disruptive shifts:
1.“Extending” the enterprise to a new mobile perimeter of users and “Things”2.“Virtualizing” infrastructure and applications through cloud architectures 
3.“Defending” core assets against cyber threats of all types
 We are a team of people that combine many years of investment experience with successful senior operating roles in major global companies. This has enabled us to establish a powerful network of technical advisors, executives and functional experts who will actively engage with our portfolio companies. Together we are able to offer our entrepreneurs substantial expertise, resources and strong connections. 
“We are often the first and most active institutional investor. Our goal is to partner with our CEO’s to provide the support and advice they need, in order to build game changing companies”

A multi-disciplinary and collaborative team that is always trying to help, connect, and find quorum to push the company forwardJulio Casales, CEO/Founder SurvelaIn evaluating investment partners we selected BGV during a oversubscribed financing round, one where the company was courted by multiple VC firms. The entire BGV partnership team has outstanding operating backgrounds and understands the complexities of scaling companies from start-up to billion dollar businesses. It was important for me that Eric, Anik, and Eric were always available and reinforced their commitment to provide operational and strategic value.  I am a firm believer in BGV’s overall philosophy in adding the value actually requested by the entrepreneur instead of becoming a lead balloon for the executive team to manage (unlike other venture firms who tout their value add).  For me this translated to a patient and ideal investment partner on all frontsGarret Gafke, CEO Identity MindBGV is a new breed of venture capital , it is the brainchild of serial entrepreneurs and experienced operating individuals that have built and operated great companies.

The regulatory focus of the new administration can best be divided into two categories: regulations that address the economy and regulations that address security. In the first bucket are regulations and policies that affect what businesses pay from a tax perspective,

Optimal Stopping Algorithms And Venture Investing

                                                                                                        Eric Benhamou BGV Founder and General Partner shares his perspective on how “optimal stopping” computer algorithms may inform venture capital investment decisions. What does “optimal stopping” have to do with venture capital investing? More than you may think at first blush. “Optimal stopping” refers to the classical computer science problem of deciding when to stop

The early stage venture capital industry has been enjoying some very healthy returns over the past several years. Limited partners were primarily large financial institutions such as endowment, pension funds, insurance companies in the

The 25 Coolest Tech Companies in Israel – 14: Secret Double Octopus

                                                                                                        Israel continues to produce an impressive number of highly successful tech companies for a country with a population of just 9 million people. The Middle Eastern country is sometimes referred to as “Startup Nation” thanks to the sheer number of entrepreneurs building businesses there, particularly in cities like Tel Aviv. Multinational tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft

The Fallacy Of Unicorn Hunting

                                                                                                        Eric Benhamou BGV Founder and General Partner shares his perspective on the fallacy of Unicorn hunting. These days, it is hard to escape the Unicorn fetish phenomenon in the world of Venture Capital. No self respecting VC blog would be complete without a few postings on the subject. This one captures the perspective shared by

Product[edit]
The product is addressing the needs for more transparency on financial products. Pricing Partners has developed an online platform (entitled Price-it) that provides independent valuation on OTC derivatives. The computations are based on scientific methods with mathematical probabilistic models (models extending the Black-Scholes model).[2]
History[edit]
After a PhD in financial mathematics at the London School of Economics, and years of research in the fixed income exotics trading desk at Goldman Sachs, Eric Benhamou, a mathematician, returned to France to head a quantitative research group at Natixis. In 2005, he created Pricing Partners to offer independent valuation models with its primary customer Natixis.[3]
In 2007, Pricing Partners decided to build the first French platform for independent valuation of derivatives, in a project supported by the French cluster Finance Innovation to promote the Paris market place and compete with the City of London.[4]
In 2008, Pricing Partners unveiled a new version of its software that ran on a computing grid to reduce dramatically the computing time.[5]
In 2009, Microsoft France identified Pricing Partners as one of the promising startups to develop software in finance with the use of the latest Microsoft technology. Pricing Partners was accepted in the IDEES program.[6] The same year, Axa Hedging Services selects Pricing Partners to value part of its fixed income positions.[7]
In 2010, Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking taps Pricing Partners to provide independent valuation on its structured products.[8]
In 2011, this company received the award for the best pricing and analytics solution for structured products in all asset classes. This award was given by Structured Products Magazine.[9] The same year, ICBC, the largest bank worldwide, signed with Pricing Partners.[10]
In 2012, Pricing Partners receive a new distinction ranking by the Structured Products magazine in the category of structured products valuation software. The same year, Pricing Partners started commercializing an independent valuation solution for proprietary and algorithmic indexes and tapped Natixis.[11]
In 2013, Pricing Partners continues to be named to the Structured Products magazine ranking in the structured products valuation software.[12] In June 2013, the company is acquired by the Thomson Reuters group.[13] Finally, in December, Pricing Partners is named the Most Innovative Specialist Vendor of the year by Risk Magazine[14]
