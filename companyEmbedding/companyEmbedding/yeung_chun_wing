			Everything Wing Chun® grew organically out of the Wing Chun Archive site as a way to provide you with the best selection of quality Wing Chun products and as a means to fund multiple on-line projects for the betterment of the art of Wing Chun kung-fu...
		




			Mr. Cantrell started training Wing Chun in 1999 and for 2 years collected all the information that he could on the art, amassing somewhere between 300-400 books and videos on the subject (this was pretty much everything ever made up to that point - the collection later grew to well over 1000 unique titles). The Wing Chun Archive (WCA) was founded in September of 2001 as a personal listing of these books and videos for other collectors to compare by. Due to the high number of emails from collectors looking for the rare items mentioned, he started the Wing Chun Archive store to help collectors grow their collection. This allowed for the expansion of the site to include the now famous listing of sifus and schools.
		

			Over the next few years he kept adding more and more products to the selection until in May of 2005 Everything Wing Chun (EWC) was created to take the place of the store on the WCA site. When it opened it was already the largest Wing Chun store in the world, with over 250 unique products and growing. The goal was to have a web store focused only on Wing Chun and offering as many quality products as possible related to the art. It was a Wing Chun first.
		

			Over the next 10 years EWC was constantly trying to make this store better for our customers and trying gather all the good Wing Chun (Ving Tsun, Wing Tsun, etc) products that we can under one roof for you (recently the Everything Wing Chun site currently listed over 1800 separate Wing Chun products from 70 different teachers/authors). While we are not technically a non-profit organization, the proceeds from sales on this site are used to promote and develop Wing Chun. Our latest sites (eWingChun.com and WingChunUniversity.com) bring you an incredible resource site as well as a truly great videos to learn the entire Wing Chun system online.
		

"I sincerely hope you enjoy all our sites and come back often.  We will 
always do our best to serve you and we are always open to suggestions.  Please email me () if you need anything."  



Train Hard,

Wing Chun History & Lineage:  Robert Yeung









 


History & Lineage
Robert Yeung
  
  








Master 
Robert Yeung was born in Kowloon in 1938.  His first martial arts 
experience began when he was 16 years old:  The teenaged Yeung joined a Japanese Judo school 
in Kowloon.  Yeung found grappling to his liking and stayed with the school for 
four years, rising to the rank of senior brown belt.  Master Yeung recalled that 
there were not many Kung Fu schools around.  The Chinese Kung Fu schools that he 
visited lacked the discipline and the regimental training found in traditional 
Japanese Judo training.  "I recommend Judo training for teenagers before they 
learn kung fu."

  

Master Yeung joined the police auxiliary at the age of 21.  He also attended 
drafting school while working part-time.  Master Yeung's childhood friend, Shak 
Chun Wah, stopped by one day to pass on the word about a system of Kung Fu named 
Wing Chun.  The Wing Chun system was practical and useful in street situations 
typically found in Hong Kong.  As both young men shared their knowledge, Robert Yeung got his first experience with Wing Chun.  Shak moved swiftly inside Yeung's 
arms, delivered several punches, shifted his stance, and trapped one arm over 
the other arm with a downward pressing palm maneuver.  The two friends talked at 
length about the unique arm trapping and leg jamming techniques within the Wing 
Chun system.  Shortly after this meeting, Shak took Yeung to see Master Wong 
Long.  At the age of 24, Robert Yeung began training in Wing Chun Kung Fu under 
Si-Gung Wong Long.

  
Learning quickly, Robert Yeung became Wong Long's close assistant and 
sparring partner.  Robert Yeung rigorously trained with Wong Long for just over 
four years.  To expand his Wing Chun horizon of knowledge, Robert Yeung sought 
instruction from Wong Chok.  During the next two years, Wong Chok imparted to 
Robert Yeung the two coveted Wing Chun weapons.  Wong Chok also expanded Yeung's 
knowledge of using Wing Chun's tactical footwork traps and jams to uproot and 
gain advantage over an opponent.  Yeung established himself as a skilled and 
aggressive fighter.  His unyielding and forward charging ability earned him the 
Wing Chun name Yeung Biu.  ("Biu" is a special Chinese name for Tiger.)
  
Master Wong Chok took Robert Yeung to meet the now aged Yip Man.  With Wong Chok's introduction and recommendation, Yip Man gave his approval for Robert 
Yeung to open his own school and teach students.  Robert Yeung stayed in Hong 
Kong for another two years before meeting his wife and moving to Hawaii, U.S.A. 
in 1971.  He recalled the many hardships that he had to endure in a new country 
as an immigrant.  Despite the rough transition, Yeung officially opened his first 
Wing Chun school in Hawaii in 1973.  As his following grew, Yeung's school moved 
from Rex Ravell's gym in Honolulu to the Armed Forces YMCA.  The Armed Forces 
YMCA became the home of Wing Chun in Hawaii for the next 12 years, from 1974 to 
1986 when the building was sold.  Master Yeung's school relocated to the Chinese 
Cultural Plaza, Chinatown, in 1987.  Today, Master Yeung's Wing Chun Kung Fu 
school is still open.  His Wing Chun school in Hawaii is one of the oldest 
traditional schools operating outside of Hong Kong.
  
Master Yeung has retired from work to spend more 
time at his Chinatown Wing Chun school in Honolulu.  His two children (a girl 
and a boy) are now grown.  Master Yeung enjoys teaching and plans to travel 
more during his retirement from work.  He states that there are many promising 
young students in his school today.  "If they can diligently pursue their Wing 
Chun training, they will become our next generation of Wing Chun teachers."
  
During the past 24 years of Master Yeung's teaching in Hawaii, hundreds of Wing Chun practitioners have come through his program.  Dozens of Master Yeung's students have finished the Mook Jong 
(Wooden Man) techniques.  Of the many graduates of Master Yeung, eleven have established their own schools while 
many others are teaching small groups around the United States and 
internationally.  Although Master Yeung never mentioned his success, it can 
be said that he was one of the most 
successful Wing Chun teachers in the United States.  This website is dedicated to 
Master Yeung, his many graduates, and his numerous followers. Master Yeung 
passed away Sepetember 3, 2009. He is very much missed.
