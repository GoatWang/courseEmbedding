ISBA Announces Third Quarter 2016 Earnings
10-27-2016
Jae A. Evans, Chief Executive Officer of Isabella Bank Corporation (OTCQX:ISBA), announced the Corporation’s third quarter 2016 earnings results. The Corporation reported net income of $3.59 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. “The continued growth in our loan portfolio has led to another successful quarter,” stated Jae Evans, Chief Executive Officer for Isabella Bank Corporation. “Although the interest rate environment continues to be a challenge on our net interest margin, our growth strategies continue to deliver positive results.”
Net IncomeThe Corporation's third quarter 2016 net income of $3.59 million resulted in earnings per common share of $0.46, compared to $4.06 million and $0.52 for the third quarter 2015.  During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported net income of $10.02 million and $11.83 million, and earnings per common share of $1.28 and $1.52, respectively.  While interest income for the first nine months of 2016 increased $1.43 million in comparison to the same period in 2015, the decrease in net income and earnings per common share is due primarily to changes in the provision for loan losses.  During the first nine months of 2016, an increase in gross loans during the period of $138.87 million, offset by improvements in various credit quality indicators and increased net loan recoveries, resulted in recording a provision for loan losses in the amount of $185,000.  By contrast, during the first nine months of 2015, a reduction in gross loans during the period of $235,000, coupled with significant improvements in various credit quality indicators, resulted in a reversal of the provision for loan losses in the amount of $2.00 million. 
AssetsAs of September 30, 2016, total assets increased to $1.71 billion and assets under management grew to $2.41 billion - which includes loans sold and serviced, and assets managed by the Corporation's Investment and Trust Services Department of $699.61 million.
LoansThe Corporation's $138.87 million growth in the loan portfolio over the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was largely driven by an increase in the commercial loan portfolio of $106.47 million.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Corporation entered into a participation agreement to fund advances to mortgage originators which contributed $27.83 million of the growth in the commercial loan portfolio. Strategies the Corporation implemented during the second quarter of 2016 related to residential mortgage and consumer loans also contributed to the increased volume. Residential mortgage loans and consumer loans at the end of the third quarter 2016 were $260.12 million and $40.76 million, compared to $251.50 million and $34.70 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.
Net Interest IncomeDuring the first nine months of 2016, net interest income increased $974,000 in comparison to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of the loan growth described above which increased interest income by $1.44 million. The Corporation's net yield on interest earning assets remained historically low at 3.00% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  With no anticipated increases in short term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, significant improvements in the net yield on interest earning assets are not expected in the short term.  An increase in net interest income will occur only through continued strategic growth in loans, investments, and other income earning assets. 
DividendDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Corporation paid a $0.25 per common share cash dividend which represented a 4.17% increase over the per common share cash dividend for the third quarter of 2015. Based on the Corporation's closing stock price of $27.70 as of September 30, 2016, the annualized cash dividend yield was 3.50%.

ISBA Announces First Quarter 2016 Earnings
4-28-2016
Jae A. Evans, Chief Executive Officer of Isabella Bank Corporation (OTCQX:ISBA), announced the Corporation's first quarter 2016 earnings results.
The Corporation's first quarter 2016 net income was $3.02 million, with earnings per common share of $0.39. As of March 31, 2016, total assets increased to $1.68 billion and assets under management grew to $2.37 billion - which includes loans sold and serviced, and assets managed by the Corporation's Investment and Trust Services Department of $690.84 million. During the quarter, the Corporation paid a $0.24 per common share cash dividend which represented a 4.35% increase over the per common share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2015. Based on the Corporation's average stock price of $27.75 for the month of March 2016, the annualized cash dividend yield was 3.46%.
During the first three months of 2016, interest income increased by $328,000 in comparison to the same period in 2015. Net income for the same period of 2016 declined in comparison to 2015 as a result of growth in the loan portfolio which contributed to an increase in the provision for loan losses. For the three month period ended March 31, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $156,000. Net loans charged-off during the first three months of 2016 were $56,000 as compared to net loan recoveries of $226,000 in the first three months of 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, the Corporation began to see a significant improvement in loan credit quality indicators through low levels of loans classified as less than satisfactory in addition to those considered to be nonperforming. This improvement along with net recoveries and a reduction in gross loans, resulted in a reversal of provision for loan losses of $726,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2015.
The Corporation's total loan portfolio at March 31, 2016 increased by $19.80 million from December 31, 2015 which was largely driven by growth in the commercial loan portfolio. Growth in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios continues to be challenging. However, the Corporation is implementing new strategies and improving the overall process related to residential mortgage loans which is expected to lead to increased volume. In the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation will be streamlining delivery channels for direct and indirect loans in order to attract new customers and generate growth in the consumer loan portfolio.
The Corporation's net yield on interest earning assets remained historically low at 2.98% for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. With no anticipated increases in short term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, no significant improvements in the net yield on interest earning assets are expected in the short term. Growth in net interest income will increase only through continued growth in loans, investments, and other income earning assets. The Corporation is committed to increasing earnings and dedicated to providing long term sustainable growth to enable us to increase shareholder value.
The Corporation's dedication to its customers and their communities was recently recognized by the Michigan Bankers Association. Isabella Bank, the Corporation's banking subsidiary, was awarded the Michigan Bankers Association Financial Literacy Award for the fifth consecutive year.

ISBA Announces 2015 Earning
Jae A. Evans, Chief Executive Officer of Isabella Bank Corporation (OTCQX:ISBA), announced the Corporation's 2015 earnings today which included record net income and earnings per common share.
The Corporation's net income and earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $15.13 million and $1.95, compared to $13.72 million and $1.77 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Corporation paid a $0.24 per common share cash dividend which represented a 4.35% increase over the per common share cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash dividends per common share totaled $0.94 in 2015 and $0.89 in 2014, continuing the Corporation's 34 consecutive years of dividend growth. Based on the Corporation's average stock price of $27.32 for the month of December 2015, the annualized cash dividend yield was 3.44%.
During 2015, total assets grew by 7.65% to $1.67 billion and assets under management - which includes loans sold and serviced, and assets managed by the Corporation's Investment and Trust Services Department of $692.14 million - grew to $2.36 billion. Contributing to the Corporation's growth were increases in the commercial and agricultural loan portfolios of $26.30 million as well as $92.60 million in the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Balance sheet growth will continue to be the Corporation's focus to increase net interest income.
The growth in earnings during 2015 was primarily attributable to increased net interest income and improvements in credit quality. During 2015, the Corporation realized net loan recoveries of $71,000, compared to net loan charge-offs of $732,000 in 2014. Total loans past due as a percent of gross loans declined to 0.56% as of December 31, 2015 when compared to 1.09% as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, loans classified as less than satisfactory declined significantly during 2015. These factors resulted in a reduction in the level of the allowance for loan losses in both amount and as a percentage of gross loans. As a result, the reversal of provision for loan losses were $2.77 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
The Corporation recently participated in the OTCQX Banks Virtual Investor Conference, an event that features live webcast presentations by senior management of U.S. community banks that trade on the OTCQX Banks marketplace.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
