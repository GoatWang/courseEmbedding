					Full Description



Omnitek Engineering Corp. (Omnitek), incorporated on October 9, 2001, develops and sells diesel-to-natural gas engine conversion systems and complementary products, including natural gas engines that utilize the Company's technology. Omnitek products are available for stationary applications (generator sets), the global transportation industry, which includes light commercial vehicles, minibuses, heavy-duty trucks, municipal buses, as well as rail and marine applications. The technology can be used for compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) or Biogas (RNG). The Company has developed a system that can be used to convert diesel engines to be able to operate using natural gas. Omnitek offers approximately four primary product lines, which include a conversion kit for converting rich-burn natural gas engines to lean-burn; a conversion kit for converting diesel engines to run on natural gas; natural gas engines, and natural gas components. The Company operates an approximately 25,000 square feet of industrial space.The Company's diesel-to-natural gas engine conversion technology is the primary product offered by Omnitek. This product is packaged in kit form and is offered in approximately two basic variations, including one designed to work on engines with a turbocharger and the other designed to work on engines without a turbocharger. Both kits consist of over 20 individual components depending on the particular engine specifications. The Company's engine conversion system enables a fleet to overhaul/convert its diesel engines into natural gas engines during its normally scheduled engine overhaul.Omnitek sells the individual component replacement parts for the conversion kits. The high-pressure natural gas filter is its primary replacement part, which is also supplied to certain natural gas vehicle manufacturers as original equipment. Omnitek supplies natural gas engine management components to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket customers. The high-pressure natural gas filter is used by various original equipment (OE) vehicle manufacturers around the world. The Company's conversion technology is adapted to work with various different engine designs and configurations. Omnitek has distributors in over 12 countries, which market and distribute its products.The Company competes with Fuel Systems Solutions, Bosch, Keihin and Cummins.

Omnitek Engineering, Corp.
Omnitek Engineering, Corp. (OMTK) develops and sells proprietary diesel-to-natural 
                    gas engine conversion systems (DNG) and complementary products, including new natural gas engines that utilize the company�s technology -- 
                    providing global customers with innovative alternative energy and emissions control solutions that are sustainable and affordable.

					
The DNG system has established Omnitek as a leader in the industry. Omnitek offers a total-system approach and is dedicated to supplying alternative energy and emissions control solutions that 
                    are sustainable and affordable.
                    As long as the price of crude oil remains high and environmental concerns need to be addressed, 
                    the search for an alternative fuel becomes increasingly important. Natural 
					gas has emerged as a perfect solution. Readily available in many countries from indigenous sources, natural gas 
                    is inexpensive and clean burning.
					Diesel engines have been the backbone of the transportation and power generation industry. Valued for their power, fuel economy 
					and durability, diesel powered trucks, buses and generators are used worldwide, 
					however, the high cost of diesel fuel and environmental policies have forced trucking fleets to look for an affordable option to transition their fleets to natural gas. Omnitek has developed a system to convert  
					diesel engines to clean-burning natural gas engine at a fraction of the cost of a new 
					natural gas vehicle or engine. 
                    Prevailing economic factors, rising oil prices and energy security issues, make abundantly available and inexpensive natural gas the fuel for the future. 
With over 5,000 engines converted worldwide, the Omnitek 
					DNG conversion technology leads the way to a cleaner future.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
