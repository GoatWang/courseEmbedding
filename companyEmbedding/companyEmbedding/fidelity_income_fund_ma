			Fixed income investments generally pay a return on a fixed schedule, though the amount of the payments can vary. Individual bonds may be the best known type of fixed income security, but the category also includes bond funds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Structured products from Fidelity 
Fidelity currently offers "new issue" structured products that are either:

Market-linked (e.g., equity or currency indexes) certificates of deposit, which carry FDIC insurance protection on the invested principal, subject to FDIC coverage limits ($250,000 per account owner per institution); or
Senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, which are not FDIC-insured.

Features & Benefits




Risks




Examples




Types









How They Work













As with any new issue offering, prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure. Customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period. At issuance, customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted. However, submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation. If the offering is oversubscribed (more securities were requested than available for purchase), and you did not withdraw your order, you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested, or none at all. Further, if the offering is undersubscribed, the offering can be pulled.
Investments in structured products that are FDIC-insured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit, which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank. This underlying CD provides the FDIC protection on this investment. Non-FDIC-insured structured products have no CD issuance. With these investments, which are unsecured debt, customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer.
 Components of Fidelity’s structured products 
The structured products offered through Fidelity.com include the following components:
Payout profile
Fidelity currently offers only a point-to-point payout profile. A payout profile represents how a customer's cumulative return is measured. The return of the structured products available on Fidelity.com is measured based on two points: point A (initial or starting index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date) and point B (final index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document). The product will provide its investment return based on the following formula:
(final index level – starting index level)

starting index level
Certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a "cap" or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket (see below).
Participation rate
The potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate. If the participation rate of the structured product is less than 100%, the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket. For example, if the participation rate is 80%, the investor will receive only 80% of any positive return on the index or basket, assuming no other limits on return potential. The participation rate will vary by product, and factors such as index type, maturity, and caps affect the rate.
Cap
A cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket. In other words, if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap, investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return. For example, if a structured product allows for 100% participation in an index subject to a 50% cap, the investor cannot earn more than 50% on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that.
Costs and fees
Placement fees, structuring, development, and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products. Investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing.
Taxes
Structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. This means you'll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity. In addition, any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income. Please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details.













Features & Benefits













 Market participation 
Investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index. Principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index, but is subject to issuer credit and default risk.
 Access to alternative asset classes 
Investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access.













Risks













 Credit and default risk 
Structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer. Therefore, the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product. In summary, if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy, the investor may lose all or some of the investment. In the case of FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, deposit amounts exceeding applicable FDIC coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank. Other limitations on FDIC coverage may apply. Structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not FDIC-insured. In the event of issuer default on a non-FDIC-insured product, repayment of principal would be subject to the issuer's restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed.
 Limited FDIC protection 
For FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, FDIC coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only. Any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not FDIC-insured. If you hold more than the FDIC-insured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank, you will not receive the benefit of FDIC insurance for any balance in excess of FDIC limits. In this instance, amounts in excess of FDIC-insured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank.
 Liquidity risk 
Structured products are intended to be held until maturity. Due to a limited secondary market, it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity. Additionally, should a secondary market exist, investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss.
 Market or opportunity risk 
The potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket. The return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security.
 Derivatives risk 
The issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives and/or trading in one or more instruments, such as options, swaps, or futures. The costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market.
 Commodity price risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities, you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities. Trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile. The performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities.
 Currency and exchange rate risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket, you may be subject to foreign currency risks. The value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors, which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and global or regional political, regulatory, economic or financial events. Performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates.













Examples













The scenarios presented below are hypothetical. Actual investment performance may differ. In all cases, return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor.
 Scenario 1: The index rises 
Assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. In this scenario, the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product; in other words, it was up 50% between purchase date and maturity. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%). So at maturity, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $400 index return amount, for a total of $1,400.



 Scenario 2: The index falls 
In this scenario, assume return is again tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index, but in this case, the index falls 50% over the life of the structured product. The customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate; instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product. Assuming it was 100%, then regardless of how far the index fell, the customer would receive a full return (i.e., 100%) of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term. In this example, the customer invested $1,000 and would receive it back at maturity.



 Scenario 3: A capped return 
In this final scenario, again assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. Assume again that the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Finally, assume a cap of 35%. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%) OR the cap amount of $350 ($1,000 × 35%). So in this scenario, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $350 cap index return amount, for a total of $1,350.



These examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security. Taxes, inflation, fees and/or expenses were not taken into account. If they had been deducted, performance would have been lower. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Your performance will vary, and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity. Before you start, you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples.

Fidelity® Massachusetts Municipal Income Fund: Portfolio Manager Q&A

JANUARY 31, 2017
View as PDF


Fund Managers
Kevin Ramundo
Q&A


An interview with Co-Portfolio Manager Kevin Ramundo

Kevin, how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017?
Munis were under pressure throughout much of the past 12 months, resulting in their lackluster return. The muni market began to sell off in the fall of 2016 in response to growing supply. The sell-off intensified in October and especially November, due to the steep rise in interest rates after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election and Republicans maintained control of Congress.
Munis reversed course in December and continued upward in January as demand firmed and interest rates remained range-bound.
For the year, the fund returned -O.92%, roughly in line, net of fees, with the -0.79% return of the Bloomberg Barclays Massachusetts 3+ Year Enhanced Municipal Bond Index and the -0.63% result of the Lipper peer group average.

Did market volatility prompt any changes in your investment strategy?
We certainly didn't make any wholesale changes, continuing to adhere to our long-term investment principles. Throughout the year, we based investment decisions on longer-term objectives.
In our opinion, shareholders invest in the fund because they want attractive tax-exempt income and competitive risk-adjusted total returns, including both price appreciation and income, over time.
For example, our multiyear effort to position the fund to benefit from advance refundings was rewarded this fiscal year, with our overweighting in such securities helping performance versus the Massachusetts index. These refundings occurred when the issuer refinanced existing debt ahead of its first call date in order to lock in current financing rates.
Such refinancings usually result in price gains for bondholders. The bonds' maturities shorten and their credit quality rises, because they are backed by high-quality U.S. government securities – typically U.S. Treasuries, which are widely considered the highest-quality bonds available.
But volatile market conditions also presented us with some opportunities to make a few adjustments. Specifically, we took advantage of the increase in yields following the November 8 U.S. elections to buy bonds we believed to be undervalued.
Q: Where else did you uncover value?
We added to our holdings in lower-rated investment-grade bonds, targeting credit tiers in which we already maintained a larger-than-index stake.
This positioning proved timely, and was a key contributor to the fund's performance versus its state index. Lower-quality investment-grade securities, rated A and BBB, attracted heavy demand from yield-seeking investors until the election, helping them to generate better price appreciation than higher-quality securities.
In addition, lower-quality investment-grade bonds were boosted by the comparatively high level of income they generated.
Many of our recent purchases of securities rated A and BBB occurred in the final months of 2016. That's when lower-quality investment-grade bonds had come under pressure – making them look attractively valued to us – as investors increasingly sought higher-quality issues in the wake of growing uncertainty after the election.
But we didn't just invest in bonds solely because they carry higher yields. Rather, we focused on bonds that our research indicated offered a good balance between yield and risk, and had the potential to outperform the muni market over time, as was the case with the A-rated and BBB-rated securities I just described.

What decisions detracted from performance versus the Bloomberg Barclays index?
It hurt to hold debt issued in the U.S. Virgin Islands. These tax-exempt bonds performed quite poorly amid downgrades of some of the islands' debt to below-investment grade, reflecting the U.S. territory's significant economic, financial and budgetary challenges. We sold these bonds well before period end.

What is your outlook as of January 31?Looking ahead, our expectations for municipal returns are modest. Even though valuations adjusted meaningfully in the final months of the period, they could continue to be influenced by a surge in supply, growing expectations for multiple interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2017, and uncertainty surrounding the fiscal and regulatory policies of the new administration.
While the election results clearly signal the increased likelihood for policy shifts, the exact path of execution is yet to be determined. Furthermore, some proposals could have a more muted impact than anticipated, and even present buying opportunities.
Take tax reform, for example. Although lower tax rates could hurt municipal bond valuations, we believe the empirical evidence over more than 30 years suggests that tax-rate changes are an unreliable indicator of future muni returns. Instead, muni valuations tend to be driven more by changes in interest rates and credit fundamentals. While short-term interest rates appear poised to rise, we think muni credit fundamentals, in most cases, remain supportive.
Furthermore, the current reform proposals articulated by the Trump administration and notable members of Republican leadership do not mention the elimination of the muni tax exemption. To the contrary, most of these proposals contemplate the elimination of the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which we think could lead to outperformance for muni bonds that are subject to this tax, should any of these proposals get traction.
Later, I'll describe some of the other potential policy shifts we're watching.
We continue to have a favorable view of Massachusetts' credit outlook. The state's economic growth continues to outpace the nation, the governor and legislature have a good working relationship, and it continues to demonstrate fiscal discipline. ■ 





Kevin Ramundo on policy shifts that may affect muni bonds: 


"We think broad federal tax reform under a Trump administration is likely. In addition, we think other potential policy changes that could affect muni valuations are possible, including:
Health care reform: "Post-election, muni hospital bonds broadly came under pressure, partly due to concerns that repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) might negatively affect credit within the sector. We think the possible demise of the ACA would be felt most by hospitals that serve economically challenged populations.
"Conversely, we think hospitals with dominant market share and more negotiating leverage with commercial insurers are less likely to be impacted.
"Additionally, we think mergers and acquisitions among hospital systems could accelerate if ACA reform leads to an increase in health care costs. We believe that Fidelity's bottom-up research process is well-positioned to identify risks and opportunities in this evolving sector.
Infrastructure: "We think infrastructure development is likely to be a policy priority for the new presidential administration. Even so, we doubt that its prioritization will translate into a material increase in the supply of tax-exempt muni bonds.
"To the contrary, we believe many state- and local-government issuers remain cautious about borrowing, even though rates remain historically low. Furthermore, we think proposed federal subsidized solutions, similar to the Build America Bonds (taxable munis) program, could reduce tax-exempt muni supply, which could help to support bond prices."



Key Takeaways



The fund returned -0.92% for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017, roughly in line, net of fees, with the -0.79% return of the Bloomberg Barclays Massachusetts 3+ Year Enhanced Municipal Bond Index, as well as the Lipper peer group average.

Amid substantial interest rate volatility the past 12 months, the portfolio managers continued to focus on longer-term objectives by seeking to generate attractive tax-exempt income and competitive risk-adjusted returns over time.

The fund's performance versus the Massachusetts index was helped by overweightings in bonds that were advance refunded during the period and lower-rated investment-grade bonds. In contrast, detractors included an overweighting in tax-exempt bonds issued in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Looking ahead, the management team foresees modest returns for municipal bonds.

On May 2, 2016, Cormac Cullen and Mark Sommer joined Kevin Ramundo as Co-Managers of the fund.





MARKET RECAP


For the year ending January 31, 2017, tax-exempt bond performance was slightly negative, with the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index returning -0.28%. For much of the period, fairly strong demand and a stable credit environment for state and local governments drove moderate muni returns. But a downward trend began in September and steepened through November – the worst month for the muni market since 2008 – as investors became concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's promises to lower taxes, repeal the Affordable Care Act and increase infrastructure spending would negatively impact market valuations. All fixed-income markets were hurt by investor anticipation of further increases in policy interest rates. The muni market stabilized during the last two months of the period as it became clear that changes to tax, health care and fiscal policies would take time to develop and implement. There was little differentiation in performance among municipal sectors this period. General obligation bonds overall returned -0.77%. Within this sector, bonds issued by local municipalities slightly outperformed state-backed bonds. Looking ahead, we expect further market volatility as the details of proposed policy changes emerge and the U.S. Federal Reserve reacts to job growth and inflation trends.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 714 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks reasonable income. In pursuing this objective, the fund will also consider the potential for capital appreciation.




Strategy



Investing in securities issued throughout the world. Normally investing at least 80% of assets in equity securities. Normally investing primarily in income-producing equity securities.  Seeking to exceed the yield on the MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) Index. Potentially investing in other types of equity securities and debt securities, including lower-quality debt securities. Allocating investments across different countries and regions.  Using fundamental analysis of factors such as each issuer's financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to select investments.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds.



Short Term Redemption Fee
This fund has a Short-term Redemption Fee of 1.00% for fee eligible shares held less than 30 days.



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking an investment that invests in both domestic and international markets.
Someone who is willing to accept the volatility of the markets and the generally higher degree of risk associated with international investments.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because Morningstar has rated its risk below the 20th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Keep in mind the cumulative effect of fees and expenses can substantially reduce the growth of your retirement savings, but is only one of many factors to consider when you decide to invest in an option. Visit the Department of Labor's website for an example of the long-term effect of fees and expenses.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 12/31/2017 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
