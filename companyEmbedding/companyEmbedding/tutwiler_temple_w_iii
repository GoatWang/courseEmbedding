Temple W. Tutwiler III, president of Tutwiler Properties, Ltd., has been elected to National Bank of Commerce’s board of directors.
Holman Head, president and CEO of O’Neal Steel Company, was also elected.
Tutwiler’s family has owned property in Trussville since the 1940s.
Tutwiler has also served as a director of First American Bank.
“We are fortunate to have these experienced executives join our board of directors,” said John H. Holcomb III, chairman of the National Bank of Commerce Board of Directors. “These additions to our board of directors are consistent with our growth plan and bring added thoughtful leadership to our board.”
