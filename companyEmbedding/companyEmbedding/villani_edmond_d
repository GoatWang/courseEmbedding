Edmond D. Villani
 
As chief executive officer of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Ed Villani led one of America's oldest and largest global asset management firms, with more than $600 billion under management. He began there in 1974 as an in-house economist and went on to play vital roles such as chief economist, chief investment officer, and president until becoming CEO in 1996. He later guided the firm through mergers with Zurich Insurance Group and Deutsche Bank, staying on as vice chair of North American asset management until 2005.
A lover of mathematics and statistics, Villani was drawn to Penn's economics department because of its strong reputation in econometrics. While learning from economics professors like Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein, he began to appreciate the key role finance plays in an economy, and he took advantage of Penn's academic breadth by adding finance courses to his econometrics work in order to deepen his understanding. His resulting dissertation was an econometric model of the determinants in the development costs in the chemical industry. He earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1973, having received a B.A. in mathematics from Georgetown University in 1968.
Today, Ed divides his time between Tuscany, where he tends a small vineyard and olive grove, and New York. He feels very fortunate that he can now give something back to the educational institutions that played a formative role in his development. Until recently, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of Georgetown University, where he served as chair for seven years. At Penn, he is chair of the Advisory Board of the Penn Institute for Economic Research and a former member of the Economics Visiting Committee. He enthusiastically supports the department and is pleased to see such positive interaction between students and faculty. “It's the way graduate school should be,” he says.

		Georgetown Inaugurates the Edmond V. Villani Chair in Economics
	

Washington, D.C. – Georgetown University today inducts the first Edmond V. Villani Chair in Economics thanks to a generous gift from Edmond D. Villani (COL ’68), chair of Georgetown’s Board of Directors, and his wife, Cynthia.  In memory of Edmond D. Villani’s father, the chair provides the university’s undergraduate college with critical faculty and research support in the field of economics.  University professor Francis Vella will be the first faculty member to hold this position.   
 
"The exceptional generosity of the Villani family has allowed the university to mount a competitive international search for an outstanding teacher and scholar in the field of econometrics,” said Jane McAuliffe, Dean of Georgetown College, where the chair will reside.  “We are delighted to welcome Professor Frank Vella to the Georgetown community."   
 
Educated at Xavier High School and Fordham University in New York, Edmond V. Villani impressed upon his son the value of a broad education in the Jesuit tradition and the importance of effort and hard work over academic standing.  With the 1999 endowment of the chair, the Villanis honor their family’s appreciation for education and the lasting influence of Edmond D. Villani’s many professors at Georgetown, including professor George J. Viksnins.  The junior Villani is CEO of Scudder, Stevens & Clark and the former vice chairman of Deutsche Asset Management.  He has been a member of Georgetown’s Board of Directors since 1998 and has served as the board’s chair since 2002.   
 
“I grew up in a family, which clearly understood and appreciated the benefits of a broad liberal arts education and was willing to make the sacrifices to ensure that I receive one,” Edmond D. Villani said.  “At Georgetown University, I had the benefit of studying with professors, many of whom influenced the direction my life would later take, who cared deeply about their students.  I know that Professor Frank Vella will continue this great tradition, making Georgetown an even stronger place for undergraduate and graduate education.”   
 
The inaugural chair holder, econometrician Francis Vella, joined the university’s Department of Economics in 2005 with research experience in the testing and estimation of micro econometric models.  His academic papers have appeared in leading economics journals, including The Journal of Econometrics, The Review of Economic Studies and Econometrica.  He holds economics degrees from the University of Sydney, Australian National University and the University of Rochester.  Vella previously served on the faculty of Rice and Rutgers universities and the European University Institute in Florence.  He is also an international research associate at the Institute of Fiscal Studies in London.

About Georgetown University
Georgetown University is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in America, founded in 1789 by Archbishop John Carroll. Georgetown today is a major student-centered, international, research university offering respected undergraduate, graduate and professional programs on its three campuses in Washington, DC.

World Bank Economist to Join Georgetown Economics Faculty









Martin Ravallion

November 27, 2012 – Martin Ravallion, director of the World Bank’s research department, will join Georgetown as its inaugural Edmond D. Villani Chaired Professor of Economics in the spring semester.
“The faculty [members] of the economics department are excited to welcome him as a colleague, but I anticipate that Martin's presence will be felt throughout the entire Georgetown University community,” says Francis Vella, professor and chair of economics. “This will not only be through his undergraduate and graduate teaching but also through interaction with other units across the university.”
Ravallion is well known for his scholarship on development economics. His wide-ranging research includes his early work on famines as well as his research on the causes of poverty and the evaluation of anti-poverty policies. He is probably best known for his work on measuring global poverty, including developing the international “$1-a-day" poverty measure.
In the late 1980s, World Bank economists observed that some developing countries drew their poverty lines at about $370 of income per year.
	That led Ravillion to the often-used measurement, which divides $370 by 365 days.
“As an economist who has devoted almost all his professional life to using knowledge to help fight poverty in the world, moving to Georgetown University at this time makes a lot of sense,” Ravallion says.
He has held academic positions at the London School of Economics, the University of Oxford and the Australian National University before joining the World Bank in 1988. Since then he also has held several visiting positions at institutions such as Princeton University and the Université de Toulouse in France.
The economist has published extensively and received a number of academic honors, including the 2011 John Kenneth Galbraith Award “for outstanding contributions to humanity through leadership, research and service” at the annual conference of the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association.
Ravallion’s chair is named after Georgetown alumnus and business executive Edmond D. Villani (C’68).
“The Villanis’ extraordinary generosity, along with Ed Villani’s active involvement with the department, has been one of the major reasons for our substantial progress in the last eight years,” says Vella, the recipient of the Edmond V. Villani Chair in Economics, named after Ed Villani's father. “This involvement has resulted in important appointments … such as professors Guido Kuersteiner and John Rust, and now, Martin.”
Kuersteiner, a leading econometrician, joined the Georgetown faculty in 2010. Rust, a pioneer in structural econometrics, became a Georgetown professor this fall.
