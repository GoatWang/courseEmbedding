La Z Boy Parts










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 
La 
Z Boy Incorporated, founded in 1927, is one of the oldest furniture 
manufacturers in the United States.  Their plant, located in Monroe, MI, makes 
furniture for every room in the home. 
La Z Boy originally used electrical components manufactured by Emerson 
Electric (which aren't available anymore); from there on, they have used electrical 
components made by both Okin and Dewert, both West German companies.  In 
fact, La Z Boy has used the most "diverse" combinations of electrical systems than 
any other chair manufacturer by far....  
Below we have listed the most common repair parts used on La Z Boy 
chairs, along with the factory list prices and our discounted pricing.  If 
you don't see what you are looking for, either call or E-Mail 
us.  Most of  these parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without heat and/or 
massage functions.  Parts for chairs with heat and massage are readily 
available (at least, for the newer model chairs), but there are so many variations that it would be impossible to list 
them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand 
control used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a 
La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a 
female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
normally have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  PLEASE NOTE: 
The replacement part you will receive from us will have a WHITE 
colored block; Okin doesn't sell many of these blocks, and the last time they 
did a production run, they used white material instead of black.  
Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.  However, if your motor assy. is not 
working because of an electrical issue (example: the transformer only 
"clicks" when the button is pushed, or the motor is not making any noise, or 
attempt to run), we may be able to get this assy. repaired for you.  We 
have a repair co. that we have been using for many years that can repair most 
electrical problems with the unit.  The repair cost usually runs $150 - 
$200; You can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the 
unit, and we will send it out for repair.  Repair time normally takes 2-3 
weeks.  If the motor assy. is physically broken (example: the clevis 
on the back of the motor is broken, or the motor sounds like it is running, but 
the stroke tube isn't moving), there is no repair available.  
Okin Note 27:  This technically is a Dewert 
part, not an Okin, but we show it here because several La Z Boy chairs use both 
Dewert and Okin parts together... There are several different motors that have 
the MCZ designation (La Z Boy makes several style chairs that have three 
MCZ motors installed, all different...  NOTE: Because of the way La Z Boy 
chairs are designed, It is very difficult to determine whether the 
problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor, or 
the control box (wire harness).  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.
Okin Note 28:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Okin Note 29:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You possibly could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they did still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Okin Note 31:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine whether 
you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, you need 
to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the 
transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin in the 
middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of that 
plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, you 
will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 32:  This is the extension cable that 
goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) 
under the chair.  It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and 
has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, 
and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box.

NOTE: Hubbell Special Products discontinued operations in October, 2008, 
        so we have a very limited number of component parts - please call for availability.  Our MS-1000 replacement 
        motor is being used by a major chair manufacturer, and is a perfect fit 
        for the Hubbell MC-42 in lift chairs.

Information Notes on 
Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
 Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

La Z Boy Parts










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 
La 
Z Boy Incorporated, founded in 1927, is one of the oldest furniture 
manufacturers in the United States.  Their plant, located in Monroe, MI, makes 
furniture for every room in the home. 
La Z Boy originally used electrical components manufactured by Emerson 
Electric (which aren't available anymore); from there on, they have used electrical 
components made by both Okin and Dewert, both West German companies.  In 
fact, La Z Boy has used the most "diverse" combinations of electrical systems than 
any other chair manufacturer by far....  
Below we have listed the most common repair parts used on La Z Boy 
chairs, along with the factory list prices and our discounted pricing.  If 
you don't see what you are looking for, either call or E-Mail 
us.  Most of  these parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without heat and/or 
massage functions.  Parts for chairs with heat and massage are readily 
available (at least, for the newer model chairs), but there are so many variations that it would be impossible to list 
them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand 
control used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a 
La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a 
female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
normally have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  PLEASE NOTE: 
The replacement part you will receive from us will have a WHITE 
colored block; Okin doesn't sell many of these blocks, and the last time they 
did a production run, they used white material instead of black.  
Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.  However, if your motor assy. is not 
working because of an electrical issue (example: the transformer only 
"clicks" when the button is pushed, or the motor is not making any noise, or 
attempt to run), we may be able to get this assy. repaired for you.  We 
have a repair co. that we have been using for many years that can repair most 
electrical problems with the unit.  The repair cost usually runs $150 - 
$200; You can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the 
unit, and we will send it out for repair.  Repair time normally takes 2-3 
weeks.  If the motor assy. is physically broken (example: the clevis 
on the back of the motor is broken, or the motor sounds like it is running, but 
the stroke tube isn't moving), there is no repair available.  
Okin Note 27:  This technically is a Dewert 
part, not an Okin, but we show it here because several La Z Boy chairs use both 
Dewert and Okin parts together... There are several different motors that have 
the MCZ designation (La Z Boy makes several style chairs that have three 
MCZ motors installed, all different...  NOTE: Because of the way La Z Boy 
chairs are designed, It is very difficult to determine whether the 
problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor, or 
the control box (wire harness).  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.
Okin Note 28:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Okin Note 29:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You possibly could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they did still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Okin Note 31:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine whether 
you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, you need 
to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the 
transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin in the 
middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of that 
plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, you 
will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 32:  This is the extension cable that 
goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) 
under the chair.  It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and 
has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, 
and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box.

Information Notes on 
Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
 Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

Hand Controls










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

Shown below are the most common hand controls now in use on lift chairs.  
The only real way to tell which control you need for your chair is to pay 
attention to the plug that attaches to the motor or transformer, and compare 
that plug with the illustrations below (oddly enough, the part you actually hold 
in your hand is not the most important factor in determining which 
        control you need; all basic "Up/Down" switches pretty much work the same 
        - the key is how it attaches to the other electronics).  

Shipping within the continental USA is included in 
the prices quoted.  We stock these 
        parts in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).  
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Hand Controls
Note 1:  This hand control comes standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong round connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
Note 2:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that have a heat/massage 
system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out there.  The 
connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly 
used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� For those, you 
will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control.
Note 3:  This hand control is used with a Von Weise low volt 
motor system.  The connector on the end of the hand control cord has a 
small square four prong plug.  NOTE: the control you will receive will look 
a little different than the one pictured, but will work the same, except that 
the replacement control will not be lighted.  The original control pictured 
is not available any longer; neither is any other component of the low volt Von Weise electronics set, but we found a 
company that could manufacture this replacement hand control. 
Note 4:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls are the most common Okin 
hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one piece cord that 
�disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath 
the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #6212 has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and it 
plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand control like the one 
pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both wired the same.  The 
way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold 
in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug a 
few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord disappear down through 
a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer design, and was developed 
as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair 
over.  Another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they 
like playing on the chair, then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t 
play with it (of course, it�s OK with us if you let them play with the 
chair � grandkids are great for our business�) 
Note 5:  This is the extension cable only that the #6212 
hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes on down to 
plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to replace 
this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Note 6:  This control is for chairs that have a dual motor 
system; one motor controls the up & down motion of the chair, the other motor 
controls the back action.  This control has a round five pin plug like the #6210 & 
#6212, but has two rows of buttons.
Note 7:  This control looks like our # 6210, but it has a round 
plug with seven pins; this is a very rare hand control that we 
hardly ever sell, so be sure that your plug has the seven pin 
connector before you order.
Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control.  
Note 9:  This is also a common hand control used on La Z boy lift 
chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that 
your old hand control has a sticker with the number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy 
has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Note 10:  This is just as pictured; it is only used on Golden 
chairs designed with an infinite position back.  Please note that the chair 
has to be designed for the infinite position function; just ordering this 
control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the 
infinite position function.
Note 11:  The #8210 and #8212 hand controls are the most common

Dewert hand controls in use today.  The #8210 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8212 has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and it 
plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The #8212 control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control 
close to the plug end that has "P/N 3544" or "P/N 3547.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8212), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8210).  The #8212 is the newer design, and was 
developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the 
chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and 
they like playing on the chair, then you can easily unplug the control so they 
won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us if you let them play with 
the chair � grandkids are great for our business�).  If you want to 
upgrade to the quick disconnect feature, you can simply order the #8212 control and 
the # 8243 extension cable below; this will give chairs with the older style one 
piece cord the convenience of the quick disconnect setup.  NOTE: If you 
think you have the # 8212 type hand control, then please look at Note 12 below to be sure 
you get the correct version for your chair.
Note 12:  The #8217 is for Pride chairs made after November 2006 with

Okin or FBS electronics.  The hand control looks almost identical to 
the # 8212 above, except it has a six terminal switch inside to accommodate the 
Okin system.  The way to tell the difference between the #8212 and #8217 
is as follows: 1) Look at either the transformer or the motor; if either of 
these has the word "Dewert" on it, then you need the #8212 hand control; 
if it has "Okin or FBS" on either, you need the # 8217 control.  2) The 
#8212 control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close 
to the plug end that has "P/N 3544" or "P/N 3547"; the #8217 has a white tag 
that says "P/N KC-7059"
Note 13:  This is the extension cable only that 
only the #8212 
hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes on down to 
plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to replace 
this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.  Note: this 
extension cable will only work for chairs that have the Dewert electrical 
system; it WILL NOT WORK with chairs that have the Okin or FBS, or other 
compatible systems, nor will it work for the # 8217 hand control above.
Note 14:  The #8214 and #8214QD controls are for chairs with heat and massage systems; 
the controls have a large paddle switch for up & down, and below they have two 
smaller switches (red and white) for the heat and massage.  As with the # 
8210 & # 8212 controls in Note 11 above, the #8214 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8214QD has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and 
it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8214QD), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8214).
Note 15:  The #8216 and #8216QD controls are for chairs with an 
infinite control system 
for the chair back; the controls have a large paddle switch for up & down, and 
below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the 
back down.  As with the #8210 & #8212 controls in Note 11 above, the 
#8216 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8216QD has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and 
it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8216QD), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8216).
Note 16:  These controls are generally used on only the high-end, 
very expensive Pride chairs.  Each has a grey control housing, with a black 
thumb switch for the up & down, and below that are four push switches, a top red 
switch for heat, and three white switches below that for the massage and 
intensity.  The # 8218 has nothing above the black up & down switch, while 
the #8219 has a white infinite button control above the black up/down 
switch; just compare the pictures to your control to see which one you have.  
NOTE: If you have the # 8219, please call us for options on what parts you will 
need to get the chair back running again.
Note 17:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE 
FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  The control pictured here 
is is the newest style hand control from Pride; it is a grey control, with push 
buttons for up & down, plus a lock button.  It attaches to a control box , 
which then attaches to an Okin transformer and an Okin Deltadrive motor.  
However, Pride has had many 
production problems with this setup; it seems either the hand control was 
failing, or more often, the control box it plugged into went bad.  They tried 
several different solutions, but finally settled on using a standard Okin quick 
disconnect control (our part # 6212) and eliminating the control box.  
What you need to do is to completely remove the control box from the 
chair... First, find the control box; usually, it is mounted behind the 
chair, or underneath the chair toward the rear.  If you don't see it, just 
follow either the wire from the hand control, or the wire coming from the 
transformer; both plug into wires off the control box.  Unplug all the 
wires coming from that box and remove the box from the chair.  Then, you 
take the cord coming from the transformer toward the chair, and plug it in to a short two prong cord off the 
actuator that nothing 
is currently plugged into.  Then, you  plug the new hand control cord to the 
other cord coming out of the motor.  
Everything then is plugged directly to the motor (which is how all the other 
major chair manufacturers wire their chairs).  With this new configuration, the hand control isn't 
lighted, but it is a much simpler setup with much less to go wrong with it.  
Please understand that you won't be getting the grey hand control that is 
pictured, but if you take the #6212 that we send you, and you follow the 
instructions above, this should take care of the problem.  
Note 18:  These are recessed controls that are normally 
found in power recliners and theater chairs... They are built into either the 
arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side of the chair.  There 
are several different styles of these recessed controls, but they all have a 
round five pin connector on the end of the cord.  The #6290 has a 
rectangular housing, and is held on by two screws (the screw holes measure 3 
1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an oval shaped housing, and is also 
held on by two screws ( the screw holes measure 2 5/8" center to center); the 
#6293 has a round housing with a diameter of 2 5/8".\
Note 19:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Note 20:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Note 21:   The # 8215 and #8215QD controls are for chairs with both heat and massage and infinite control systems; 
the control has a large paddle switch for up & down, and below they have a 
smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down and two 
smaller switches (red and white) for the heat and massage.  The 8215QD has a  
quick disconnect SEVEN PIN plug  that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  The 8215 has a long one piece cord with a FIVE PIN plug that 
goes down through a hole in the chair and plugs in to the control box underneath 
the chair.  Before you order, please look at the plug on the end of 
your hand control cord, and order the control that matches the notes above.
Note 22:  After so long a time, we now 
have these recessed controls in stock. These are used on Berkline and other 
manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a 
telephone type plug for the recessed control, and it plugs into our part # 
JLDP power supply.
Note 23:  This is the newest style hand control sold by Golden 
Technologies.  It has features such as memory buttons and a button to make 
the chair go into the TV watching position.  Please note: This hand control 
cannot be substituted for a standard two button hand control just because you 
want these features on your chair; the chair would need the rest of the 
electronics designed for this control. 
Note 24:  This hand control is manufactured by Tranquil Ease, and 
is sometimes used with Chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  The back of the control will list a "model # 2802HL-PR3" on the control.  
It has a one piece cord with a nine pin screw on connector that looks like what 
would screw into the back of a computer.
Note 25:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE 
FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  This hand control was manufactured by Tranquil Ease, and 
is sometimes used with chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  This 
control has been discontinued from the manufacturer, and is no longer available.  
We replace this control with our part # 6210 hand control.  It has two 
buttons for up & down, but does not have the lock/unlock button.  
PLEASE NOTE: There were two versions of this hand control:  one has 
the one piece cord with the round plug with five pins; the #6210 will be an 
exact replacement for that version.  The other version has a six pin 
rectangular connector that plugs into a control box under the chair, and then 
there is a cord that comes out of that control box to go to the motor.  In 
that case, all you need to do is to eliminate the control box, and plug 
the new hand control directly to the cord from the motor (the new hand 
control does not require the control box to operate).
Note 26:  This is a newer style hand control that Golden started 
using a few years ago, when all the lift chair manufacturers started using 
lighted hand controls.  Note:  If you are not a fan 
of the lighted control, you can use our part # 6212 control (which is what 
Golden used for many years before they went to this one).  As you can see, 
it is a black control with two white buttons; it doesn't light up or have the 
wood grain finish, but it is a good bit cheaper than this newer control.  
We have both in stock, so it all comes down to your preference.
Note 27:  This is the extension cable that goes from the side 
pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) under the chair.  
It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and has an eight pin 
female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, and an eight pin 
male connector that plugs into the control box.
Note 28:  This is the new style deluxe heat & massage and 
infinite hand control 
with two small buttons on the top of the control for heat seat and heat back.  
Most of these units don't have any markings on the back of the hand control, but 
it is distinguishable, in that it has a 25 pin 
connector with thumb screws that screw into a control box under the chair.
Note 29:  This hand control was manufactured by Tranquil 
Ease, and was sometimes used with chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  
This control is nearly identical to our part # 8290 control, but it had a cord 
with a round quick disconnect plug that plugged into another cord that went down 
to plug into the control box under the chair.  The back of the control will list a "model # 2802-GT3" on the control.  
This control is not being manufactured any longer, but you can use the #8290 
control, and run the #8290 hand control cord down and plug it directly into the 
control box; you will just not have the quick disconnect any longer. 
Note 30:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY 
CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  
Please note that there are are two six button hand controls 
that have been used on Pride chairs that look exactly alike, but are not 
interchangeable.  There are two ways to tell which hand control you need: 1) 
Look at the serial # on the chair; if the serial # is before 
Lxx28213xxxxx (where the small x's could be any number or letters), then the 
#8296 is the correct control.  If it is after Lxx28213xxxxx then the part 
# 8296A will be the correct one.  2) You can also look at the control box that 
the hand control extension cable plugs into and see what number is on that box; 
if it has CM105B on the box, then the #8296 will be the correct one; if it has 
any other number on the box, then the #8296A will be the correct one. 
Note 31:  There have been several different versions of this hand 
control; some had "up & down", some had "fwd and back", but as long as your hand 
control has this shape, and the buttons are in these approximate positions, it 
will be the correct one (we always ship the most current version).  The 
hand control has a round plug with eight pins, and it plugs into the 
control box under the chair.
Note 32:  This is Pride's newest hand control for basic up/sown 
lift chairs.  The hand control is slim design, with two buttons that light 
up.  It has a round plug with 5 pins and a straight connector.

Since its foundation in West 
Germany in 1986, OKIN has 
continuously developed to become a byword for quality in furniture actuators and 
adjustment systems. With its know-how, capabilities and efficiency, OKIN today 
is a partner for the furniture and medical industry all over the world.  
Because of their quietness and dependability, most of the major manufacturers of 
lift chairs either have Okin listed as an optional upgrade for their chairs, or 
have make Okin their standard lift system.   
Listed below are  
parts for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without 
heat and/or massage functions.  Parts 
for chairs with heat and massage are readily available 
(at least for the newer model chairs), but there are so many 
variations that it would be impossible to list them all here. 


Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 4:  The #6201 is the Okin motor that 
Pride is using on their newer model chairs.  It has proven to be one of the 
most durable and reliable actuators ever used on lift chairs.  It is 
possible for this motor to go bad, but in reality, unless you hear the motor 
running or gears grinding but the actuator is not moving, it is very unlikely 
that this motor is the problem in the chair.   The great majority 
of the time, you will find the problem is in the hand control, especially if 
your chair has the #8213 hand control on the 
Pride page on our website.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very common hand control 
used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have 
a La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11540 on the back.  Please give us a call if you have this type of 
hand control, but you don�t have a La Z Boy chair� We probably have 
another control that will work, but if you don�t have a La Z Boy chair, this 
control won�t work. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand control 
used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a La Z Boy 
chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number 
11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to 
this control, but it has different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. 
Please give us a call if you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 
will not work with those controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has 
a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below  is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin male connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and with other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  Installation instructions 
are listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  This DeltaDrive motor is 
primarily used in the heavy duty dual motor lift system of Golden's PR-502, 
although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.  It 
looks much like the #6200 DeltaDrive above, but it has only one cord coming off 
the motor, and that cord has a round plug with seven pins.  It plugs 
into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 27:  This OmegaDrive motor is used 
for the back recline feature primarily on Golden's Relaxor 755 & 756 series 
chairs, although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.   
It will have Okin's part # 1.43.000.117.30 on a sticker on the motor housing.  
It has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin, and 
it plugs into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 28:  This OmegaDrive motor is used 
for the back recline feature primarily on Golden's Relaxor 755 & 756 series 
chairs, although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.   
It will have Okin's part # 1.43.000.223.30 on a sticker on the motor housing.  
It has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin, and 
it plugs into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 29:  This control box is used on 
several model chairs, although mainly found on Golden's PR-501 & 502 heavy duty 
chairs.  It is needed to run both the lift motors together.
Okin Note 30:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine 
whether you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, 
you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug 
into the transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin 
in the middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of 
that plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, 
you will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 31:  This transformer is mainly used 
in power recliner and power theater chairs.  It is very similar to the 6232 
transformer above, except on the output end... The 6232 output connection is 
integrated into the plastic housing, whereas the 6233 has a cord coming from the 
housing that the flat blade/round blade connector plugs into.  The 6233 
also does not have an emergency backup system.
Okin Note 32:  This is just as pictured; it is 
only used on Golden chairs designed with an infinite position back.  Please note that the chair 
has to be designed for the infinite position function; just ordering this 
control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the 
infinite position function.
Okin Note 33:  After so long a time, we now 
have these recessed controls in stock. These are used on Berkline and other 
manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a 
telephone type plug for the recessed control, and it plugs into our part # 
JLDP power supply.
Okin Note 34:  We - finally - have these power 
supplies in stock.  These are used on Berkline and other manufacturers 
power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a telephone type 
plug for the recessed control (our part # JLDK), and a two pin plug for the 
actuator.  Also, this part will replace the power supplies on the units 
with CIAR parts (even though it doesn't look anything like the CIAR units).
Okin Note 35:  This actuator normally fits on Berkline 
and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  It has a two 
pin white connector that plugs into our #JLDP power supply.  Also, this 
part will replace the actuator on the units with CIAR parts
Okin Note 36:  This is a heavy duty transformer 
used by a few of the chair manufacturers.  It has a female five pin plug, 
although many times the manufacturers use a three pin plug from the chair to the 
transformer. 
Okin Note 37:  This DeltaDrive motor is mainly 
used as the main up/down motor on Golden's dual motor chairs, although other 
manufacturers have used it from time to time.  The motor will have either 
three cords coming out of the housing, or it will have two cords and another 
small two prong socket built into the top of the motor housing.  Usually, 
it will have either the numbers 1.31.000.034.30 or a 72276 number on the sticker 
on the motor housing.

Switches










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

Shown below are the four most common switches now in use on lift chairs.  
The only real way to tell which switch you need for your chair is to take the 
switch housing apart and compare the switch inside with the illustrations below 
        (NOTE: Be sure the chair is unplugged before you take apart the switch 
        housing.)   Be sure to notice the tabs on the switch sides 
        that the screws go through to attach the switch to the housing; some are 
        straight and even with the top of the switch housing, others have the 
        tabs indented down the side of the switch.  

Shipping within the continental USA is included in 
the prices quoted.  We stock these 
        parts in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).

troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Switches
Note 1:  The SWS48SE is the most commonly used switch on Pride 
lift chairs.  The switch has three terminals that normally come out to the
side of the switch (although some other manufacturers bend them down), 
and the mounting tabs on the switch housing (the ones that the screws go 
through) are  even with the top of the switch housing.  
NOTE: Before 
you order the switch, please follow the testing steps on our Troubleshooting 
Tips page to see if the switch is the problem, and not the wiring in the hand 
control.  The wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out, and the symptoms 
are identical to having a bad switch.  Please also remember that if a 
switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we can't take it back, as the 
switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 2:  The SWS48 is only used on fairly old lift chairs; it 
hasn't been used on a chair that I know of since the mid 1990's.  It has 
also never been used on a Pride lift chair  (If you have a 
Pride lift chair with a switch like this, then it will be the SWS48SE above).  The 
switch has three terminals that normally come out to the bottom of the 
switch , and the mounting tabs on the switch housing (the ones that the screws 
go through) are indented down about 1/8 of an inch from top of the switch 
housing (this is to make it sit higher in the switch housing, and is the 
main difference between this and the SWS48SE above.   NOTE: Before you 
order the switch, please follow the testing steps on our Troubleshooting Tips 
page to see if the switch is the problem, and not the wiring in the hand 
control.  The wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out, and the symptoms 
are identical to having a bad switch.  Please also remember that if a 
switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we can't take it back, as as the 
switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 3:  This is a rocker switch, as opposed to the paddle 
switches above, and hasn't been used in lift chairs for several years now.  
It comes with three terminals that are designed for solder connections; some 
manufacturers use this switch with push on connectors, and with a little 
ingenuity you could make that work (although if you have a solder gun, it would 
be very easy to just cut the connectors off and solder the wires to the 
terminals).  As far as I know, this is the only rocker switch available for 
any model of lift chair.  If you have a question as to whether this one will work, you can 
always order the complete hand control we show on the 
Hubbell page on our website and "hard wire" the plug to your motor.  
Please also remember that if a switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we 
can't take it back, as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 4:  This a black switch with five gold terminals that pushes 
onto a circuit board inside the switch housing.  We used to get these 
switches from Hubbell, but since they went bankrupt a few years ago, we haven't 
found another source for them.  Your only real option is to just order the 
complete hand control we show on the Hubbell page on 
our website.  Many of the controls that have these switches already have a 
four prong connector where it attaches to the motor, you you can just order the #4210 four prong control; a 
few older units have the three prong connector we show below that one on the 
Hubbell page.  Any older that that, you will need to "hard wire" the 
control to your motor.

Hubbell Parts










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

When lift chairs really came "into their own" in the mid-1980's, Hubbell 
        Special Products was the manufacturer of choice for motorized lift systems.  
In later years, as the West Germans developed low voltage systems, many of the 
manufacturers opted to go with the newer technology, although several 
manufacturers still used Hubbell as their standard option.  There are, 
        however, still many thousands of chairs operating everyday with Hubbell 
        systems installed.

NOTE: Hubbell Special Products discontinued operations in October, 2008, 
        so we have a very limited number of component parts - please call for availability.  Our MS-1000 replacement 
        motor is being used by a major chair manufacturer, and is a perfect fit 
        for the Hubbell MC-42 in lift chairs.
 Listed below are  
parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without 
heat and/or massage functions.  
 Parts 
for chairs with heat and massage are readily available (at least for the 
newer model chairs), but there are so many 
variations that it would be impossible to list them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).

When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

 Information 
Notes on Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




A location at the Savi Ranch Center in Yorba Linda






La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Rt.1, Saugus, Massachusetts - 2001






La-Z-Boy in Ontario


In 1928, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and invested in the furniture business in the small town of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called "nature’s way of relaxing."[2] Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood-slat porch chair with a reclining mechanism. Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it—La-Z-Boy was the winner.[3]
In 1969, after years primarily as a manufacturer of recliners, La-Z-Boy started designing other products including reclining sofas, sleep sofas and modular groups.[3] 1981 sales were $150 million.[4] In 1983, La-Z-Boy introduced its first line of stationary sofas and occasional chairs, later offering a full line of home furnishings.[3]
The LADD Furniture deal, decline, and recovery[edit]
Richard R. Allen, Don A. Hunziker and William O. Fenn borrowed $70 million to buy Lea, American Drew and Daystrom from Sperry & Hutchinson in 1981. LADD, whose name came from the three companies, began trading publicly in 1982.[5] LADD was the third-largest American maker of furniture for homes, with over $600 million in sales, when it bought six Maytag businesses in 1990.[6] LADD Industries moved from High Point, North Carolina to Grandover in Greensboro, North Carolina in November 1997, becoming the first company to locate its headquarters there. At the time it was the fifth-largest American furniture maker, with $500 million in sales, and the brands American Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Clayton Marcus, Lea, Pennsylvania House and Pilliod.[7] In September 1999, La-Z-Boy, at the time the largest American upholstered furniture manufacturer, bought LADD, the seventh-largest American furniture maker, for $197.8 million in stock and $101.5 million in assumed debt. Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman said the deal "sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth."[5][8] The deal, approved in January 2000, gave La-Z-Boy $2 billion in sales and made it one of the country's two largest furniture makers, Furniture Brands International being the other.
On July 23, 2001, La-Z-Boy announced the LADD name would cease to exist. John J. Case, president of La-Z-Boy Residential, moved to head the new La-Z-Boy upholstery group, which included Bauhaus, Centurion, Clayton Marcus, England, HickoryMark, La-Z-Boy, Sam Moore and La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture. Don L. Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.[5][9]
Competition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal "the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry."[10] Pilliod was the first LADD division sold, to Michels & Co. in December 2001. Barclay was closed. American of Martinsville was sold to Hancock Park Associates in November 2006.[11] Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed.[10] On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.[11]
In November 2006, High Point offered $600,000 to the La-Z-Boy division that was formerly LADD to move its headquarters back.[12]
Late in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.[4]
Late in 2014, La-Z-Boy announced the closing of Lea after an unsuccessful attempt to find someone to buy the company. The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid.[13]
Licensed manufacturers[edit]
In 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.[14]

Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.[5][9]
Competition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal "the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry."[10] Pilliod was the first LADD division sold, to Michels & Co. in December 2001. Barclay was closed. American of Martinsville was sold to Hancock Park Associates in November 2006.[11] Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed.[10] On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.[11]
In November 2006, High Point offered $600,000 to the La-Z-Boy division that was formerly LADD to move its headquarters back.[12]
Late in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.[4]
Late in 2014, La-Z-Boy announced the closing of Lea after an unsuccessful attempt to find someone to buy the company. The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid.[13]
Licensed manufacturers[edit]
In 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.[14]

La Z Boy Parts










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 
La 
Z Boy Incorporated, founded in 1927, is one of the oldest furniture 
manufacturers in the United States.  Their plant, located in Monroe, MI, makes 
furniture for every room in the home. 
La Z Boy originally used electrical components manufactured by Emerson 
Electric (which aren't available anymore); from there on, they have used electrical 
components made by both Okin and Dewert, both West German companies.  In 
fact, La Z Boy has used the most "diverse" combinations of electrical systems than 
any other chair manufacturer by far....  
Below we have listed the most common repair parts used on La Z Boy 
chairs, along with the factory list prices and our discounted pricing.  If 
you don't see what you are looking for, either call or E-Mail 
us.  Most of  these parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without heat and/or 
massage functions.  Parts for chairs with heat and massage are readily 
available (at least, for the newer model chairs), but there are so many variations that it would be impossible to list 
them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand 
control used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a 
La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a 
female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
normally have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  PLEASE NOTE: 
The replacement part you will receive from us will have a WHITE 
colored block; Okin doesn't sell many of these blocks, and the last time they 
did a production run, they used white material instead of black.  
Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.  However, if your motor assy. is not 
working because of an electrical issue (example: the transformer only 
"clicks" when the button is pushed, or the motor is not making any noise, or 
attempt to run), we may be able to get this assy. repaired for you.  We 
have a repair co. that we have been using for many years that can repair most 
electrical problems with the unit.  The repair cost usually runs $150 - 
$200; You can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the 
unit, and we will send it out for repair.  Repair time normally takes 2-3 
weeks.  If the motor assy. is physically broken (example: the clevis 
on the back of the motor is broken, or the motor sounds like it is running, but 
the stroke tube isn't moving), there is no repair available.  
Okin Note 27:  This technically is a Dewert 
part, not an Okin, but we show it here because several La Z Boy chairs use both 
Dewert and Okin parts together... There are several different motors that have 
the MCZ designation (La Z Boy makes several style chairs that have three 
MCZ motors installed, all different...  NOTE: Because of the way La Z Boy 
chairs are designed, It is very difficult to determine whether the 
problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor, or 
the control box (wire harness).  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.
Okin Note 28:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Okin Note 29:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You possibly could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they did still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Okin Note 31:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine whether 
you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, you need 
to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the 
transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin in the 
middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of that 
plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, you 
will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 32:  This is the extension cable that 
goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) 
under the chair.  It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and 
has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, 
and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box.

Information Notes on 
Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
 Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

La 
Z Boy Incorporated, founded in 1927, is one of the oldest furniture 
manufacturers in the United States.  Their plant, located in Monroe, MI, makes 
furniture for every room in the home. 
La Z Boy originally used electrical components manufactured by Emerson 
Electric (which aren't available anymore); from there on, they have used electrical 
components made by both Okin and Dewert, both West German companies.  In 
fact, La Z Boy has used the most "diverse" combinations of electrical systems than 
any other chair manufacturer by far....  
Below we have listed the most common repair parts used on La Z Boy 
chairs, along with the factory list prices and our discounted pricing.  If 
you don't see what you are looking for, either call or E-Mail 
us.  Most of  these parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without heat and/or 
massage functions.  Parts for chairs with heat and massage are readily 
available (at least, for the newer model chairs), but there are so many variations that it would be impossible to list 
them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand 
control used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a 
La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a 
female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
normally have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  PLEASE NOTE: 
The replacement part you will receive from us will have a WHITE 
colored block; Okin doesn't sell many of these blocks, and the last time they 
did a production run, they used white material instead of black.  
Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.  However, if your motor assy. is not 
working because of an electrical issue (example: the transformer only 
"clicks" when the button is pushed, or the motor is not making any noise, or 
attempt to run), we may be able to get this assy. repaired for you.  We 
have a repair co. that we have been using for many years that can repair most 
electrical problems with the unit.  The repair cost usually runs $150 - 
$200; You can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the 
unit, and we will send it out for repair.  Repair time normally takes 2-3 
weeks.  If the motor assy. is physically broken (example: the clevis 
on the back of the motor is broken, or the motor sounds like it is running, but 
the stroke tube isn't moving), there is no repair available.  
Okin Note 27:  This technically is a Dewert 
part, not an Okin, but we show it here because several La Z Boy chairs use both 
Dewert and Okin parts together... There are several different motors that have 
the MCZ designation (La Z Boy makes several style chairs that have three 
MCZ motors installed, all different...  NOTE: Because of the way La Z Boy 
chairs are designed, It is very difficult to determine whether the 
problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor, or 
the control box (wire harness).  A new motor like this is only 
available from your local La Z Boy showroom dealer; there are no new aftermarket 
replacements for this motor system.
Okin Note 28:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Okin Note 29:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You possibly could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they did still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Okin Note 31:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine whether 
you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, you need 
to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the 
transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin in the 
middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of that 
plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, you 
will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 32:  This is the extension cable that 
goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) 
under the chair.  It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and 
has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, 
and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box.

Information Notes on 
Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
 Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

Hand Controls










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

Shown below are the most common hand controls now in use on lift chairs.  
The only real way to tell which control you need for your chair is to pay 
attention to the plug that attaches to the motor or transformer, and compare 
that plug with the illustrations below (oddly enough, the part you actually hold 
in your hand is not the most important factor in determining which 
        control you need; all basic "Up/Down" switches pretty much work the same 
        - the key is how it attaches to the other electronics).  

Shipping within the continental USA is included in 
the prices quoted.  We stock these 
        parts in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).  
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Hand Controls
Note 1:  This hand control comes standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong round connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
Note 2:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that have a heat/massage 
system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out there.  The 
connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly 
used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� For those, you 
will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control.
Note 3:  This hand control is used with a Von Weise low volt 
motor system.  The connector on the end of the hand control cord has a 
small square four prong plug.  NOTE: the control you will receive will look 
a little different than the one pictured, but will work the same, except that 
the replacement control will not be lighted.  The original control pictured 
is not available any longer; neither is any other component of the low volt Von Weise electronics set, but we found a 
company that could manufacture this replacement hand control. 
Note 4:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls are the most common Okin 
hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one piece cord that 
�disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath 
the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #6212 has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and it 
plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand control like the one 
pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both wired the same.  The 
way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold 
in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug a 
few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord disappear down through 
a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer design, and was developed 
as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair 
over.  Another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they 
like playing on the chair, then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t 
play with it (of course, it�s OK with us if you let them play with the 
chair � grandkids are great for our business�) 
Note 5:  This is the extension cable only that the #6212 
hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes on down to 
plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to replace 
this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Note 6:  This control is for chairs that have a dual motor 
system; one motor controls the up & down motion of the chair, the other motor 
controls the back action.  This control has a round five pin plug like the #6210 & 
#6212, but has two rows of buttons.
Note 7:  This control looks like our # 6210, but it has a round 
plug with seven pins; this is a very rare hand control that we 
hardly ever sell, so be sure that your plug has the seven pin 
connector before you order.
Note 8:  This is a very 
common hand control used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be 
sure that your old hand control 
has a sticker with the number 11540 on the back.  NOTE: The hand 
control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for La Z 
Boy.  There are other chair manufacturers that use this same control, so to 
keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each 
manufacturer, their replacement controls have the "Relaxor" name on the front 
(which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls); that 
way, they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each 
user.  The only difference you may notice is that this control lights up 
all the time (like a night light).  Some people love it, some don't, but 
there is no way to cut the light off (I have asked for that feature, and their 
engineers are "taking it under advisement...")  Nevertheless, it has proven 
to be a great replacement for the original control.  
Note 9:  This is also a common hand control used on La Z boy lift 
chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that 
your old hand control has a sticker with the number 11620 on the back.  La Z Boy 
has used controls that look very similar to this control, but it has 
different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. Please give us a call if 
you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 will not work with those 
controls.
Note 10:  This is just as pictured; it is only used on Golden 
chairs designed with an infinite position back.  Please note that the chair 
has to be designed for the infinite position function; just ordering this 
control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the 
infinite position function.
Note 11:  The #8210 and #8212 hand controls are the most common

Dewert hand controls in use today.  The #8210 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8212 has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and it 
plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The #8212 control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control 
close to the plug end that has "P/N 3544" or "P/N 3547.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8212), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8210).  The #8212 is the newer design, and was 
developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the 
chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and 
they like playing on the chair, then you can easily unplug the control so they 
won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us if you let them play with 
the chair � grandkids are great for our business�).  If you want to 
upgrade to the quick disconnect feature, you can simply order the #8212 control and 
the # 8243 extension cable below; this will give chairs with the older style one 
piece cord the convenience of the quick disconnect setup.  NOTE: If you 
think you have the # 8212 type hand control, then please look at Note 12 below to be sure 
you get the correct version for your chair.
Note 12:  The #8217 is for Pride chairs made after November 2006 with

Okin or FBS electronics.  The hand control looks almost identical to 
the # 8212 above, except it has a six terminal switch inside to accommodate the 
Okin system.  The way to tell the difference between the #8212 and #8217 
is as follows: 1) Look at either the transformer or the motor; if either of 
these has the word "Dewert" on it, then you need the #8212 hand control; 
if it has "Okin or FBS" on either, you need the # 8217 control.  2) The 
#8212 control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close 
to the plug end that has "P/N 3544" or "P/N 3547"; the #8217 has a white tag 
that says "P/N KC-7059"
Note 13:  This is the extension cable only that 
only the #8212 
hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes on down to 
plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to replace 
this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.  Note: this 
extension cable will only work for chairs that have the Dewert electrical 
system; it WILL NOT WORK with chairs that have the Okin or FBS, or other 
compatible systems, nor will it work for the # 8217 hand control above.
Note 14:  The #8214 and #8214QD controls are for chairs with heat and massage systems; 
the controls have a large paddle switch for up & down, and below they have two 
smaller switches (red and white) for the heat and massage.  As with the # 
8210 & # 8212 controls in Note 11 above, the #8214 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8214QD has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and 
it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8214QD), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8214).
Note 15:  The #8216 and #8216QD controls are for chairs with an 
infinite control system 
for the chair back; the controls have a large paddle switch for up & down, and 
below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the 
back down.  As with the #8210 & #8212 controls in Note 11 above, the 
#8216 has a one piece cord 
that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in 
underneath the chair to the motor assembly.  It has a round plug with a 90 
degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The #8216QD has a quick 
disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a semi-circle, and 
it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair; most 
have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place.  
The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you 
hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there is a straight plug 
a few inches from the coiled part (#8216QD), or does the cord disappear down 
through a hole in the chair (#8216).
Note 16:  These controls are generally used on only the high-end, 
very expensive Pride chairs.  Each has a grey control housing, with a black 
thumb switch for the up & down, and below that are four push switches, a top red 
switch for heat, and three white switches below that for the massage and 
intensity.  The # 8218 has nothing above the black up & down switch, while 
the #8219 has a white infinite button control above the black up/down 
switch; just compare the pictures to your control to see which one you have.  
NOTE: If you have the # 8219, please call us for options on what parts you will 
need to get the chair back running again.
Note 17:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE 
FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  The control pictured here 
is is the newest style hand control from Pride; it is a grey control, with push 
buttons for up & down, plus a lock button.  It attaches to a control box , 
which then attaches to an Okin transformer and an Okin Deltadrive motor.  
However, Pride has had many 
production problems with this setup; it seems either the hand control was 
failing, or more often, the control box it plugged into went bad.  They tried 
several different solutions, but finally settled on using a standard Okin quick 
disconnect control (our part # 6212) and eliminating the control box.  
What you need to do is to completely remove the control box from the 
chair... First, find the control box; usually, it is mounted behind the 
chair, or underneath the chair toward the rear.  If you don't see it, just 
follow either the wire from the hand control, or the wire coming from the 
transformer; both plug into wires off the control box.  Unplug all the 
wires coming from that box and remove the box from the chair.  Then, you 
take the cord coming from the transformer toward the chair, and plug it in to a short two prong cord off the 
actuator that nothing 
is currently plugged into.  Then, you  plug the new hand control cord to the 
other cord coming out of the motor.  
Everything then is plugged directly to the motor (which is how all the other 
major chair manufacturers wire their chairs).  With this new configuration, the hand control isn't 
lighted, but it is a much simpler setup with much less to go wrong with it.  
Please understand that you won't be getting the grey hand control that is 
pictured, but if you take the #6212 that we send you, and you follow the 
instructions above, this should take care of the problem.  
Note 18:  These are recessed controls that are normally 
found in power recliners and theater chairs... They are built into either the 
arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side of the chair.  There 
are several different styles of these recessed controls, but they all have a 
round five pin connector on the end of the cord.  The #6290 has a 
rectangular housing, and is held on by two screws (the screw holes measure 3 
1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an oval shaped housing, and is also 
held on by two screws ( the screw holes measure 2 5/8" center to center); the 
#6293 has a round housing with a diameter of 2 5/8".\
Note 19:  The 11560 has a three pin 
quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair; that extension cord goes on down to plug into the 
motor with a five pin connector.  The 11560 is not being made anymore, but 
our 6212 Okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the11560.  The 
only real difference (besides what it looks like) is that the 6212 has a five 
pin quick disconnect; however, the 6212 also comes with the extension cable 
attached that goes down to the motor.  All you need to do is to remove the 
extension cable that is now attached to your chair, and replace it with the 
extension cable that we send with the 6212.  You could order the 11560 from 
the factory (they still have a few), but our control is almost one half the cost 
of the La Z Boy control, and it seems to work better.  This explanation may 
seem complicated, but when you get the new control, it will all make sense; if 
you still have problems, just call or email us and we can help.
Note 20:  The 75000208-01 
and 75000208-02 controls were parts that la Z Boy got from overseas sources.  Those 
controls aren't available anymore, so La Z Boy found another source; the only 
problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs, a kit had to be 
developed.  This kit consists of a new hand control, a new control box, a 
new transformer, some jumper wires, and an instruction booklet - that is why the 
cost is so much (when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control 
box...).  Normally, this takes care of most electrical problems with the 
chair, as when this kit is installed, basically all critical parts will be new 
under the chair except the motors.  Unfortunately, we can no longer order 
these parts directly from La Z Boy; La Z Boy has had a "price adjustment" early in February, 
2012 on their repair parts; basically, they tripled their parts prices to 
their dealers... I have been in the service business for over 35 years, and I 
have never seen a price increase like that... You should be able 
to get this "retro kit" directly from a local La Z Boy showroom dealer. 
Note 21:   The # 8215 and #8215QD controls are for chairs with both heat and massage and infinite control systems; 
the control has a large paddle switch for up & down, and below they have a 
smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down and two 
smaller switches (red and white) for the heat and massage.  The 8215QD has a  
quick disconnect SEVEN PIN plug  that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the 
chair.  The 8215 has a long one piece cord with a FIVE PIN plug that 
goes down through a hole in the chair and plugs in to the control box underneath 
the chair.  Before you order, please look at the plug on the end of 
your hand control cord, and order the control that matches the notes above.
Note 22:  After so long a time, we now 
have these recessed controls in stock. These are used on Berkline and other 
manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a 
telephone type plug for the recessed control, and it plugs into our part # 
JLDP power supply.
Note 23:  This is the newest style hand control sold by Golden 
Technologies.  It has features such as memory buttons and a button to make 
the chair go into the TV watching position.  Please note: This hand control 
cannot be substituted for a standard two button hand control just because you 
want these features on your chair; the chair would need the rest of the 
electronics designed for this control. 
Note 24:  This hand control is manufactured by Tranquil Ease, and 
is sometimes used with Chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  The back of the control will list a "model # 2802HL-PR3" on the control.  
It has a one piece cord with a nine pin screw on connector that looks like what 
would screw into the back of a computer.
Note 25:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE 
FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  This hand control was manufactured by Tranquil Ease, and 
is sometimes used with chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  This 
control has been discontinued from the manufacturer, and is no longer available.  
We replace this control with our part # 6210 hand control.  It has two 
buttons for up & down, but does not have the lock/unlock button.  
PLEASE NOTE: There were two versions of this hand control:  one has 
the one piece cord with the round plug with five pins; the #6210 will be an 
exact replacement for that version.  The other version has a six pin 
rectangular connector that plugs into a control box under the chair, and then 
there is a cord that comes out of that control box to go to the motor.  In 
that case, all you need to do is to eliminate the control box, and plug 
the new hand control directly to the cord from the motor (the new hand 
control does not require the control box to operate).
Note 26:  This is a newer style hand control that Golden started 
using a few years ago, when all the lift chair manufacturers started using 
lighted hand controls.  Note:  If you are not a fan 
of the lighted control, you can use our part # 6212 control (which is what 
Golden used for many years before they went to this one).  As you can see, 
it is a black control with two white buttons; it doesn't light up or have the 
wood grain finish, but it is a good bit cheaper than this newer control.  
We have both in stock, so it all comes down to your preference.
Note 27:  This is the extension cable that goes from the side 
pocket of the chair down to the control box (wiring harness) under the chair.  
It is designed for the # 11540 La Z Boy hand control, and has an eight pin 
female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into, and an eight pin 
male connector that plugs into the control box.
Note 28:  This is the new style deluxe heat & massage and 
infinite hand control 
with two small buttons on the top of the control for heat seat and heat back.  
Most of these units don't have any markings on the back of the hand control, but 
it is distinguishable, in that it has a 25 pin 
connector with thumb screws that screw into a control box under the chair.
Note 29:  This hand control was manufactured by Tranquil 
Ease, and was sometimes used with chairs that have an Okin or equivalent system.  
This control is nearly identical to our part # 8290 control, but it had a cord 
with a round quick disconnect plug that plugged into another cord that went down 
to plug into the control box under the chair.  The back of the control will list a "model # 2802-GT3" on the control.  
This control is not being manufactured any longer, but you can use the #8290 
control, and run the #8290 hand control cord down and plug it directly into the 
control box; you will just not have the quick disconnect any longer. 
Note 30:  PLEASE READ THIS NOTE VERY 
CAREFULLY, AS THIS CHANGE FROM PRIDE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION.  
Please note that there are are two six button hand controls 
that have been used on Pride chairs that look exactly alike, but are not 
interchangeable.  There are two ways to tell which hand control you need: 1) 
Look at the serial # on the chair; if the serial # is before 
Lxx28213xxxxx (where the small x's could be any number or letters), then the 
#8296 is the correct control.  If it is after Lxx28213xxxxx then the part 
# 8296A will be the correct one.  2) You can also look at the control box that 
the hand control extension cable plugs into and see what number is on that box; 
if it has CM105B on the box, then the #8296 will be the correct one; if it has 
any other number on the box, then the #8296A will be the correct one. 
Note 31:  There have been several different versions of this hand 
control; some had "up & down", some had "fwd and back", but as long as your hand 
control has this shape, and the buttons are in these approximate positions, it 
will be the correct one (we always ship the most current version).  The 
hand control has a round plug with eight pins, and it plugs into the 
control box under the chair.
Note 32:  This is Pride's newest hand control for basic up/sown 
lift chairs.  The hand control is slim design, with two buttons that light 
up.  It has a round plug with 5 pins and a straight connector.

Okin Parts










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

Since its foundation in West 
Germany in 1986, OKIN has 
continuously developed to become a byword for quality in furniture actuators and 
adjustment systems. With its know-how, capabilities and efficiency, OKIN today 
is a partner for the furniture and medical industry all over the world.  
Because of their quietness and dependability, most of the major manufacturers of 
lift chairs either have Okin listed as an optional upgrade for their chairs, or 
have make Okin their standard lift system.   
Listed below are  
parts for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without 
heat and/or massage functions.  Parts 
for chairs with heat and massage are readily available 
(at least for the newer model chairs), but there are so many 
variations that it would be impossible to list them all here. 


Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Okin Parts
Okin Note 1:  The Deltadrive set is the most common 
Okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today.  Purchasing this set is a good choice if you 
don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is, you just 
want it fixed the first time. Or you may just want to update your chair to the 
latest electronics and head off any problems.  Either way, if you presently have 
the Deltadrive motor on your chair, this set should solve the problem.
Okin Note 2: The Betadrive set is very common in 
Berkline chairs, but other manufacturers have used them from time to time.  The 
decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the Deltadrive in Note 1 
above.  NOTE: Please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about 
15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If your motor is all black 
with a black block, this motor will not work� Please call for options if you 
have the black block on your motor.
Okin Note 3:  The #6200 motor is a brand new motor 
direct from the factory, and as mentioned in Note 1 above, is now the most 
common Okin motor used in lift chairs.  There should be a sticker on the side of 
your motor that says Deltadrive; if so, this is the motor you need.
Okin Note 4:  The #6201 is the Okin motor that 
Pride is using on their newer model chairs.  It has proven to be one of the 
most durable and reliable actuators ever used on lift chairs.  It is 
possible for this motor to go bad, but in reality, unless you hear the motor 
running or gears grinding but the actuator is not moving, it is very unlikely 
that this motor is the problem in the chair.   The great majority 
of the time, you will find the problem is in the hand control, especially if 
your chair has the #8213 hand control on the 
Pride page on our website.
Okin Note 5:  The Betadrive motor shown here has a 
shaft about 15�-16� long, and has a white moving block.  If the motor you 
have is all black with a black block, this motor will not work; please call for 
options if you have the black block on your motor.  Also, the #6205 motor is 
designed for lift chairs only; if you need a motor like this for a power 
recliner or theater chair, please give us a call (most of the time, theater and 
recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair; we have those in 
stock also, although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion (I 
hope�). 
Okin Note 6:  The #6210 and #6212 hand controls 
are the most common Okin hand controls in use today.  The #6210 has a one 
piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally 
plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor.  It has a round 
plug with a 90 degree angle that has five pins in a semi-circle.  The 
#6212 has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or 
magazine pocket of the chair.  It has a straight plug with five pins in a 
semi-circle, and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket 
of the chair; most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock 
them into place.  If you have a chair with an Okin system and it has a hand 
control like the one pictured, either one of these will work, as they are both 
wired the same.  The way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord 
from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part, and see if there 
is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part (#6212), or does the cord 
disappear down through a hole in the chair (#6210).  The #6212 is the newer 
design, and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without 
having to turn the chair over.  Another selling feature is that if you have 
grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair, then you can easily 
unplug the control so they won�t play with it (of course, it�s OK with us 
if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our 
business�) 
Okin Note 7:  This is the extension cable only 
that the #6212 hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair, and goes 
on down to plug into the short cord off the motor.  Normally, the only reason to 
replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism.
Okin Note 8:  This is a very common hand control 
used on more expensive La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have 
a La Z Boy chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the 
number 11540 on the back.  Please give us a call if you have this type of 
hand control, but you don�t have a La Z Boy chair� We probably have 
another control that will work, but if you don�t have a La Z Boy chair, this 
control won�t work. 
Okin Note 9:  This is also a common hand control 
used on La Z boy lift chairs.  However, be sure that: 1) you have a La Z Boy 
chair, and 2) check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number 
11620 on the back.  La Z Boy has used controls that look very similar to 
this control, but it has different numbers on the back, like 75000208-01 and 02. 
Please give us a call if you have this type of hand control, as the #6219 
will not work with those controls.
Okin Note 10:  This is the most common Okin 
transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners.  If your chair has a 
cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has 
a flat blade and a 
round blade, this is the transformer you will need.  Sometimes, transformers 
have the numbers SP2A or SP2B on them; if yours has that designation, then this 
#6232 is the one you need.  The #6242 power cord below  is included with 
the  transformer when you order it.
Okin Note 11:  This is the power cord only 
for the # 6232 transformer above.  NOTE: Don�t order this cord if you don�t also 
already have a #6232 transformer� Many folks that are missing the transformer 
off their chair (usually due to the chair being moved, put into storage, etc) 
mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going 
again, when what they really need is the transformer� The cord coming from the 
chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer,  and 
then the  transformer plugs into the wall.
Okin Note 12:  This transformer is mainly used by 
Berkline and La Z Boy, and also by other smaller manufacturers.  It has a female 
plug on the output side that takes a three pin male connector.
Okin Note 13:  This transformer is almost always 
used on Berkline chairs, and with other manufacturers with some type of heat and/or massage system.  It has a female 
plug on the output side with a six pin connector.
Okin Note 14:  This transformer is for United 
Kingdom use only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 15:  This transformer is for European 
countries only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 16:  This transformer is for 
Australia only; it will not work for chairs located in the 
USA!  It has battery backup, and the receptacle for the plug coming from 
the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade.
Okin Note 17:  This is the cord that goes from the
transformer to the motor; it has a male plug that has a flat blade 
and a round blade that goes into the transformer, and a female plug on the other 
end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade.
Okin Note 18:  This cord is also like # 6240 above, 
in that it goes from the transformer to the motor.  However, it has a 
rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from AC current to DC 
current.  It is mostly used on chairs with a Betadrive motor; many of those 
chairs have an AC transformer (it won�t have a battery backup); the 
Betadrive motor needs DC current, so that is the reason for the rectifier.  If 
you change transformers to the newer #6232 switchable AC/DC transformer, you 
will not need this type cord � you can use the #6240 above.
Okin Note 19:  This is also a cord like the 
ones above that go from 
the transformer to the motor, but this cord has a three pin male plug 
that plugs into the transformer, and a female plug on the other end that takes a 
flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor.
Okin Note 20:  This is the plastic nut (usually 
either white or yellow in color) that is inside the actuator tube (where 
you can�t really see it).  The worm screw goes through the middle of the nut, 
and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto; as the 
motor turns the worm screw, the nut rides up and down the worm screw, pushing 
and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the manufacturer of your motor 
(Okin or Dewert) before ordering this part - the part shown here 
will only work in an Okin motor - it will not fit a Dewert 
motor.  Installation instructions are listed on the Okin section of the 
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 21:  This is the white plastic 
moving block (about 3� X 4�) that the chair mounts to on a Betadrive system (if 
you have a black block, you will need our part # 6253 below); as the 
block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft, the chair goes up and down.  
There are primarily two white moving blocks used in the USA; the difference is 
in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the 
center of the block.  The way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in 
the aluminum shaft (one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft); shine a 
light into the slot and see the black worm screw.  Using a tape measure or 
ruler, pick out a tread on the worm screw, and count how many threads (or turns) 
there are to the next inch on the ruler� It will be either 6 threads (our 
part # 6254) or 9 threads (our part # 6256) per inch.  The 9 thread per 
inch size is by far the most common, but there are enough 6 thread blocks 
in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement.  It 
is very important that you check the thread size before 
you order a moving block, because if you order the wrong one and try to install 
it on your motor, we can't take it back.  Installation instructions are 
listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 22:  This black moving block fits 
An Okin Betadrive motor used on La Z Boy chairs.  The motor for this block will 
have the notation 1.07.000.064.30 on it.  Installation instructions 
are listed on the Okin section of the  
Troubleshooting Tips page on our website.
Okin Note 23:  This is the stroke tube (the metal 
tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly) with a metal connector (our 
part # 6252) included.  Note that the tube has left hand threads; it 
tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise.  
This part includes the tube and the connector on the end; it does not include 
the spindle nut #6258 inside the actuator arm.
Okin Note 24:  There are the connectors on the 
end of the stroke tube; a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair 
lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair.  The metal connector 
(#6252) and the plastic connector (#6250) are interchangeable; most older 
Deltadrive motors used the plastic connector, but if you order a new Deltadrive 
motor, it will come with the metal connector.  The plastic one is not all bad, 
however, if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the 
back of the chair, then not knowing it is against the wall, keep holding down 
the hand control.  �Something has to give� in that situation, and sometimes the 
plastic connector will break, saving something worse happening�  It�s not 
designed to break, but sometimes it just works out that way.
Okin Note 25:  These are recessed 
controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs... They 
are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa, or under the arm on the side 
of the chair.  There are several different styles of these recessed 
controls, but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the 
cord.  The #6290 has a rectangular housing, and is held on by two 
screws (the screw holes measure 3 1/2" center to center); the #6292 has an 
oval shaped housing, and is also held on by two screws ( the screw holes 
measure 2 5/8" center to center); the #6293 has a round housing with a 
diameter of 2 5/8".
Okin Note 26:  This DeltaDrive motor is 
primarily used in the heavy duty dual motor lift system of Golden's PR-502, 
although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.  It 
looks much like the #6200 DeltaDrive above, but it has only one cord coming off 
the motor, and that cord has a round plug with seven pins.  It plugs 
into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 27:  This OmegaDrive motor is used 
for the back recline feature primarily on Golden's Relaxor 755 & 756 series 
chairs, although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.   
It will have Okin's part # 1.43.000.117.30 on a sticker on the motor housing.  
It has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin, and 
it plugs into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 28:  This OmegaDrive motor is used 
for the back recline feature primarily on Golden's Relaxor 755 & 756 series 
chairs, although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well.   
It will have Okin's part # 1.43.000.223.30 on a sticker on the motor housing.  
It has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin, and 
it plugs into the chair's control box.
Okin Note 29:  This control box is used on 
several model chairs, although mainly found on Golden's PR-501 & 502 heavy duty 
chairs.  It is needed to run both the lift motors together.
Okin Note 30:  While not an Okin part per se, 
this style transformer was used in many chairs with Okin electronics to power 
the heat and massage functions if present.  Chairs that had this system 
almost always had two separate transformers; this one for the heat/massage, and 
another to make the chair go up & down.  Please Note: To determine 
whether you need the older style #6234 or the newer style #6236 transformer, 
you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug 
into the transformer;  Specifically, look to see if it has a small pin 
in the middle of the plug.  If it has a small pin in the middle of 
that plug, you will need the #6234; if it doesn't have that small pin, 
you will need the #6236. 
Okin Note 31:  This transformer is mainly used 
in power recliner and power theater chairs.  It is very similar to the 6232 
transformer above, except on the output end... The 6232 output connection is 
integrated into the plastic housing, whereas the 6233 has a cord coming from the 
housing that the flat blade/round blade connector plugs into.  The 6233 
also does not have an emergency backup system.
Okin Note 32:  This is just as pictured; it is 
only used on Golden chairs designed with an infinite position back.  Please note that the chair 
has to be designed for the infinite position function; just ordering this 
control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the 
infinite position function.
Okin Note 33:  After so long a time, we now 
have these recessed controls in stock. These are used on Berkline and other 
manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a 
telephone type plug for the recessed control, and it plugs into our part # 
JLDP power supply.
Okin Note 34:  We - finally - have these power 
supplies in stock.  These are used on Berkline and other manufacturers 
power recliners and theater chairs.  As shown, they have a telephone type 
plug for the recessed control (our part # JLDK), and a two pin plug for the 
actuator.  Also, this part will replace the power supplies on the units 
with CIAR parts (even though it doesn't look anything like the CIAR units).
Okin Note 35:  This actuator normally fits on Berkline 
and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs.  It has a two 
pin white connector that plugs into our #JLDP power supply.  Also, this 
part will replace the actuator on the units with CIAR parts
Okin Note 36:  This is a heavy duty transformer 
used by a few of the chair manufacturers.  It has a female five pin plug, 
although many times the manufacturers use a three pin plug from the chair to the 
transformer. 
Okin Note 37:  This DeltaDrive motor is mainly 
used as the main up/down motor on Golden's dual motor chairs, although other 
manufacturers have used it from time to time.  The motor will have either 
three cords coming out of the housing, or it will have two cords and another 
small two prong socket built into the top of the motor housing.  Usually, 
it will have either the numbers 1.31.000.034.30 or a 72276 number on the sticker 
on the motor housing.

Switches










  
    Medical Center Supply




       
                    


 


 

Shown below are the four most common switches now in use on lift chairs.  
The only real way to tell which switch you need for your chair is to take the 
switch housing apart and compare the switch inside with the illustrations below 
        (NOTE: Be sure the chair is unplugged before you take apart the switch 
        housing.)   Be sure to notice the tabs on the switch sides 
        that the screws go through to attach the switch to the housing; some are 
        straight and even with the top of the switch housing, others have the 
        tabs indented down the side of the switch.  

Shipping within the continental USA is included in 
the prices quoted.  We stock these 
        parts in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer, 
serial #, detailed description of part needed, etc and we will do the research 
and get back with you promptly (you may have to look on the "law tag" sewn to 
the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer, and on the frame behind 
the chair for the serial #).
Need help deciding where the problem is?  Then please click
here for our
troubleshooting guide, which shows common 
problems and their possible solutions.
Free Shipping in the 
Continental USA on All Lift Chair Parts (see Below)
Below we list the way we normally ship our parts; we don't 
have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by FedEx and 
Priority Mail (none of our competitors do...), we just feel that its the 
right thing to do... Most folks that need lift chair parts need them 
right now, not several days or weeks later.  We hope 
you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you 
need... However, if you need them even sooner, just give us a call and we can 
figure the shipping charges for Express Mail or FedEx Express; we only charge 
you what the delivery companies charge us - we aren't looking to charge 
outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some 
help...
A personal note to our parts customers:  I 
realize that for most of you, repairing lift chairs is not your primary 
occupation; many of you are attempting this for the first time.  I just 
want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily 
be installed by almost anyone (please keep in mind that the last statement was 
made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls...) 
I also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company.  
We invite you to click here to read
about us and the way we try to do business.  You 
can also click here to read some of the
testimonials that folks have sent in after they 
have completed their repairs.  If you have a question about our parts 
warranty or parts return policy, you can click here 
to go to our Guidelines page.  I invite you to 
take a look at the information on the links above,  and then you can make a decision if we are the 
kind of people that you want to do business with.
A note about ordering parts online:  We have had 
many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders.  When I 
ask why they called in to order, they normally say that they thought they would 
get it quicker if they called it in.  Actually, the opposite is true: 
When parts are ordered online through our shopping cart, we can download the 
order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly.  In 
fact, most online orders sent in by 10:00 CT will be shipped out the 
same day.  Orders that are called in have to be manually 
processed, and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped.  
While we truly don't mind if you call in with questions, etc, please don't call 
in your order expecting to get it quicker that way.  One exception:  
If you need the part overnight, and you are willing to pay the shipping expense 
for Express Mail or FedEx, you can all in (by 1:00pm CT) and most orders can be 
shipped out that day.

Information 
Notes on Switches
Note 1:  The SWS48SE is the most commonly used switch on Pride 
lift chairs.  The switch has three terminals that normally come out to the
side of the switch (although some other manufacturers bend them down), 
and the mounting tabs on the switch housing (the ones that the screws go 
through) are  even with the top of the switch housing.  
NOTE: Before 
you order the switch, please follow the testing steps on our Troubleshooting 
Tips page to see if the switch is the problem, and not the wiring in the hand 
control.  The wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out, and the symptoms 
are identical to having a bad switch.  Please also remember that if a 
switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we can't take it back, as the 
switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 2:  The SWS48 is only used on fairly old lift chairs; it 
hasn't been used on a chair that I know of since the mid 1990's.  It has 
also never been used on a Pride lift chair  (If you have a 
Pride lift chair with a switch like this, then it will be the SWS48SE above).  The 
switch has three terminals that normally come out to the bottom of the 
switch , and the mounting tabs on the switch housing (the ones that the screws 
go through) are indented down about 1/8 of an inch from top of the switch 
housing (this is to make it sit higher in the switch housing, and is the 
main difference between this and the SWS48SE above.   NOTE: Before you 
order the switch, please follow the testing steps on our Troubleshooting Tips 
page to see if the switch is the problem, and not the wiring in the hand 
control.  The wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out, and the symptoms 
are identical to having a bad switch.  Please also remember that if a 
switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we can't take it back, as as the 
switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 3:  This is a rocker switch, as opposed to the paddle 
switches above, and hasn't been used in lift chairs for several years now.  
It comes with three terminals that are designed for solder connections; some 
manufacturers use this switch with push on connectors, and with a little 
ingenuity you could make that work (although if you have a solder gun, it would 
be very easy to just cut the connectors off and solder the wires to the 
terminals).  As far as I know, this is the only rocker switch available for 
any model of lift chair.  If you have a question as to whether this one will work, you can 
always order the complete hand control we show on the 
Hubbell page on our website and "hard wire" the plug to your motor.  
Please also remember that if a switch is installed, even for a few seconds, we 
can't take it back, as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up; it has 
been "used", and no one wants to buy a used part... 
Note 4:  This a black switch with five gold terminals that pushes 
onto a circuit board inside the switch housing.  We used to get these 
switches from Hubbell, but since they went bankrupt a few years ago, we haven't 
found another source for them.  Your only real option is to just order the 
complete hand control we show on the Hubbell page on 
our website.  Many of the controls that have these switches already have a 
four prong connector where it attaches to the motor, you you can just order the #4210 four prong control; a 
few older units have the three prong connector we show below that one on the 
Hubbell page.  Any older that that, you will need to "hard wire" the 
control to your motor.

Hubbell Parts

When lift chairs really came "into their own" in the mid-1980's, Hubbell 
        Special Products was the manufacturer of choice for motorized lift systems.  
In later years, as the West Germans developed low voltage systems, many of the 
manufacturers opted to go with the newer technology, although several 
manufacturers still used Hubbell as their standard option.  There are, 
        however, still many thousands of chairs operating everyday with Hubbell 
        systems installed.

NOTE: Hubbell Special Products discontinued operations in October, 2008, 
        so we have a very limited number of component parts - please call for availability.  Our MS-1000 replacement 
        motor is being used by a major chair manufacturer, and is a perfect fit 
        for the Hubbell MC-42 in lift chairs.
 Listed below are  
parts are for the basic "up/down" lift/recline chairs without 
heat and/or massage functions.  
 Parts 
for chairs with heat and massage are readily available (at least for the 
newer model chairs), but there are so many 
variations that it would be impossible to list them all here.

Shipping within the continental USA is 
included in the prices quoted.  We stock these parts 
in our warehouse for quick shipment.  If you have any questions 
on whether a particular part will fit your needs,  please let us know.  
If you need something not listed, either call or E-Mail us.  Either way, we will need the chair manufacturer,

 Information 
Notes on Hubbell Parts
Hubbell Note 1:  This comes as a set, with 
both the 
motor and hand control, and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a Hubbell 
motor; It is best to order this if your chair has anything except a 4 
prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord 
(you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor, but if the 
motor is bad, the hand control won�t be far behind�).
 Hubbell Note 2:  This is the same as the motor 
above, but it is the motor assembly only,  without the hand control.  As long 
as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector (the two outside prongs have a 
flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong), and the hand control is in good 
shape, then this motor assembly is the one you need.  NOTE: This model 
motor won't fit any other application except a lift chair; bed motors, treadmill 
motors, etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those 
units.
 Hubbell Note 3:  This hand control comes 
standard with a four 
prong connector, and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it 
can�t be plugged in wrong.  NOTE: The four prongs mentioned here 
refer to the CONNECTOR, NOT the number of WIRES; don't just see three wires and 
assume you have a three wire connector... Most newer motors have a four prong 
connector, but only have three wires attached; you will need to unplug the 
connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct 
control.  If you have an older model hand control with a three 
prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side, then order the 
three prong one below.  If it is even older, and it has any 
other type connector (four prong with flat pins, connector with orange 
terminals, or even a six prong square connector, etc), then you can still use 
this hand control; you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp 
connectors; we have instructions on how to do this in the Hubbell section of our
Troubleshooting Tips 
page.
 Hubbell Note 4:  Chairs with Hubbell motors that 
have a heat/massage system are sort of rare, but there are still a few out 
there.  The connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones 
most commonly used, but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� 
For those, you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the 
new control.  The main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong 
connector like #4210 above.
Hubbell Note 5:  Before you order either 
the capacitor or limit switch, be sure to read over our 
Troubleshooting Tips section for the Hubbell 
motors; we hardly ever sell either of these parts, so check carefully before you 
think this might be the problem.  These do go bad, but rarely�
 Hubbell Note 6:  We now (finally) have the gear sets in stock 
for the Hubbell motors; we used to get them directly from the factory, but since 
it has now closed, we had find another source.  For anyone who has done tool and 
die or plastic fabrication work, you know that the molds for making the gears 
are very expensive, and two molds had to be made for each set, doubling the cost.  
That extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made; 
that is why the cost is so high (before you call and ask�).  IMPORTANT 
NOTE: As you can see above, there is more than one set of gears for Hubbell motors (even 
though most all Hubbell motors say MC-42); the way you tell the difference is in the
number of teeth on the gears.  Part # 4220 is mainly for lift chair 
motors; it has 55 teeth on the gear pictured on the left (the one that 
goes around the worm screw), and 25 teeth on the smaller inner gear on 
the one pictured on the right.  The other gear sets shown fit most other type Hubbell 
applications (beds, treadmills, dental chairs, etc); those sets have 
different numbers of teeth on the 
inner gear on the one pictured on the right.  It is VERY 
IMPORTANT that you 
check the number of teeth on your gears BEFORE you order a replacement 
set, because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor, 
we can't take them back.  For applications other than lift chairs, you may
have to replace the gears, as 
that may be your only option to get the motor back running again; but for lift 
chair motors, you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price 
of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you.  
We have installation instructions for the gear sets under the Hubbell section of 
our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.
Hubbell Note 7:  This stroke tube will 
only fit Hubbell motors on lift chairs; please don't think that you can 
"make it work" if your Hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair.   
We have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the Hubbell section 
of our 
Troubleshooting Tips 
page on our website.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




A location at the Savi Ranch Center in Yorba Linda






La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Rt.1, Saugus, Massachusetts - 2001






La-Z-Boy in Ontario


In 1928, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and invested in the furniture business in the small town of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called "nature’s way of relaxing."[2] Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood-slat porch chair with a reclining mechanism. Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it—La-Z-Boy was the winner.[3]
In 1969, after years primarily as a manufacturer of recliners, La-Z-Boy started designing other products including reclining sofas, sleep sofas and modular groups.[3] 1981 sales were $150 million.[4] In 1983, La-Z-Boy introduced its first line of stationary sofas and occasional chairs, later offering a full line of home furnishings.[3]
The LADD Furniture deal, decline, and recovery[edit]
Richard R. Allen, Don A. Hunziker and William O. Fenn borrowed $70 million to buy Lea, American Drew and Daystrom from Sperry & Hutchinson in 1981. LADD, whose name came from the three companies, began trading publicly in 1982.[5] LADD was the third-largest American maker of furniture for homes, with over $600 million in sales, when it bought six Maytag businesses in 1990.[6] LADD Industries moved from High Point, North Carolina to Grandover in Greensboro, North Carolina in November 1997, becoming the first company to locate its headquarters there. At the time it was the fifth-largest American furniture maker, with $500 million in sales, and the brands American Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Clayton Marcus, Lea, Pennsylvania House and Pilliod.[7] In September 1999, La-Z-Boy, at the time the largest American upholstered furniture manufacturer, bought LADD, the seventh-largest American furniture maker, for $197.8 million in stock and $101.5 million in assumed debt. Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman said the deal "sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth."[5][8] The deal, approved in January 2000, gave La-Z-Boy $2 billion in sales and made it one of the country's two largest furniture makers, Furniture Brands International being the other.
On July 23, 2001, La-Z-Boy announced the LADD name would cease to exist. John J. Case, president of La-Z-Boy Residential, moved to head the new La-Z-Boy upholstery group, which included Bauhaus, Centurion, Clayton Marcus, England, HickoryMark, La-Z-Boy, Sam Moore and La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture. Don L. Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.[5][9]
Competition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal "the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry."[10] Pilliod was the first LADD division sold, to Michels & Co. in December 2001. Barclay was closed. American of Martinsville was sold to Hancock Park Associates in November 2006.[11] Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed.[10] On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.[11]
In November 2006, High Point offered $600,000 to the La-Z-Boy division that was formerly LADD to move its headquarters back.[12]
Late in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.[4]
Late in 2014, La-Z-Boy announced the closing of Lea after an unsuccessful attempt to find someone to buy the company. The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid.[13]
Licensed manufacturers[edit]
In 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.[14]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




A location at the Savi Ranch Center in Yorba Linda






La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Rt.1, Saugus, Massachusetts - 2001






La-Z-Boy in Ontario


In 1928, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and invested in the furniture business in the small town of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called "nature’s way of relaxing."[2] Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood-slat porch chair with a reclining mechanism. Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it—La-Z-Boy was the winner.[3]
In 1969, after years primarily as a manufacturer of recliners, La-Z-Boy started designing other products including reclining sofas, sleep sofas and modular groups.[3] 1981 sales were $150 million.[4] In 1983, La-Z-Boy introduced its first line of stationary sofas and occasional chairs, later offering a full line of home furnishings.[3]
The LADD Furniture deal, decline, and recovery[edit]
Richard R. Allen, Don A. Hunziker and William O. Fenn borrowed $70 million to buy Lea, American Drew and Daystrom from Sperry & Hutchinson in 1981. LADD, whose name came from the three companies, began trading publicly in 1982.[5] LADD was the third-largest American maker of furniture for homes, with over $600 million in sales, when it bought six Maytag businesses in 1990.[6] LADD Industries moved from High Point, North Carolina to Grandover in Greensboro, North Carolina in November 1997, becoming the first company to locate its headquarters there. At the time it was the fifth-largest American furniture maker, with $500 million in sales, and the brands American Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Clayton Marcus, Lea, Pennsylvania House and Pilliod.[7] In September 1999, La-Z-Boy, at the time the largest American upholstered furniture manufacturer, bought LADD, the seventh-largest American furniture maker, for $197.8 million in stock and $101.5 million in assumed debt. Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman said the deal "sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth."[5][8] The deal, approved in January 2000, gave La-Z-Boy $2 billion in sales and made it one of the country's two largest furniture makers, Furniture Brands International being the other.
On July 23, 2001, La-Z-Boy announced the LADD name would cease to exist. John J. Case, president of La-Z-Boy Residential, moved to head the new La-Z-Boy upholstery group, which included Bauhaus, Centurion, Clayton Marcus, England, HickoryMark, La-Z-Boy, Sam Moore and La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture. Don L. Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.[5][9]
Competition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal "the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry."[10] Pilliod was the first LADD division sold, to Michels & Co. in December 2001. Barclay was closed. American of Martinsville was sold to Hancock Park Associates in November 2006.[11] Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed.[10] On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.[11]
In November 2006, High Point offered $600,000 to the La-Z-Boy division that was formerly LADD to move its headquarters back.[12]
Late in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.[4]
Late in 2014, La-Z-Boy announced the closing of Lea after an unsuccessful attempt to find someone to buy the company. The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid.[13]
Licensed manufacturers[edit]
In 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.[14]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
