                                    INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY                                




                                            The vision for HP SCF is to serve entrepreneurs and business owners that need equity capital, but believe deeply in the upside of their business such that they do not wish to dilute or liquidate their ownership.
                                        




                                    Capital Preservation
                                

                                    HP SCF targets investments with equity-like returns while assuming the risks more characteristic of debt investments. HP SCF will endeavor to achieve protection of principal by:
                                    
Investing in high quality companies that meet HP SCF’s specific investment criteria
Structuring investments to be senior in liquidation preference to a significant amount of underlying enterprise value
Obtaining rights, controls and protective covenants that HP SCF believes will further enhance the safety of the principal invested




                                    Unique Value Proposition
                                

                                    For business owners and entrepreneurs that need equity capital, HP SCF can provide flexible equity solutions and all of the resources and expertise of a private equity firm. Unlike traditional private equity, HP SCF allows entrepreneurs to retain control of their business in a structure that allows us to exit without forcing a future sale of the business.
                                


                                    Attractive Risk Return Characteristics
                                

                                    HP SCF intends to target private equity-like returns, but will feature attachment points that provide an equity “cushion” below the HP SCF investment. This structure provides less reliance on terminal value as a driver of return and protection against potential multiple contraction in the future.
                                 





                                    LEVERAGING THE RESOURCES OF HARVEST PARTNERS                                


                                    Access to the Resources of Harvest Partners
                                

                                    HP SCF intends to leverage the knowledge and intellectual capital of Harvest Partners and capitalize on the industry expertise, contacts and proprietary information Harvest Partners has developed over its 30+ year history.
                                






                                    INVESTMENT CRITERIA

                                    Relationship-Oriented Sourcing
                                

                                    HP SCF has a relationship-oriented direct sourcing effort focused on businesses that do not have a financial sponsor or professional investor. This effort is focused on accessing high quality founder or entrepreneur-owned businesses where an outright sale is not appropriate due to existing shareholders’ desires to retain or increase their ownership.
                                


                                    Seeking Competitive Advantage
                                

                                    While HP SCF does not avoid competitive situations, it will only participate in them if its investment professionals believe that HP SCF either has or can develop a differentiated point of view.

                                    A key characteristic of a prospective HP SCF investment is a requirement that the target company have an experienced and high quality management team. HP SCF then partners with that team. When appropriate, HP SCF may offer strategic and operational insights and provides access to all of the resources of a traditional private equity firm to facilitate value creation and equity growth.

                                    APPROACH TO INVESTMENT LIQUIDITY

                                    We structure our investments such that our managed funds can exit without the sale of the company. In the event that a business is performing on plan and less expensive capital is available, HP SCF will work with management to redeem our managed funds' liquidation preference and / or equity interest to provide a seamless transition for the business owner.
                                    
Our investments are also structured with the flexibility to sustain unforeseen downturns in a company’s business or industry.
                                    
We are equity investors providing equity solutions. Unlike debt, our investments do not have hard maturities or draconian features. This provides business owners with flexibility around the timing and structure of our exit.

                             Principles for Responsible Investment                        


                            As institutional investors, we believe that we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries. In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios to varying degrees across companies. We also recognize that weighing these issues in the context of our decision making may better align investors with broader objectives of society.
                        
 As such, HP SCF regularly performs environmental due diligence on all portfolio companies and avoids investments in sectors like tobacco, pornography, firearms, etc. In addition, HP SCF conducts significant strategic due diligence on every potential investment. This due diligence generally includes the impact that potential environmental, government, and social issues/trends may have on the ultimate financial performance of an investment. In this due diligence process, HP SCF regularly engages advisors to review and provide comment and analysis on the potential impact of a variety of factors which generally include environmental issues, corporate governance standards, and social trends.
