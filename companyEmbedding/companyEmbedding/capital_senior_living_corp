Management Team
About Us
Capital Senior Living Corporation is one of the nation’s largest operators of residential communities for senior adults. The Company's operating strategy is to provide value to residents by providing quality senior housing services at reasonable prices. The Company's communities emphasize a continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living and home care services to provide residents the opportunity to age in place. The Company operates 129 senior living communities in geographically concentrated regions with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents. 

Our Mission Statement
Capital Senior Living is committed to providing quality housing and services. Our goal is to enrich the daily lives of our senior residents by providing an environment that stimulates them physically, mentally and emotionally. Residents are encouraged to participate in a wide variety of programs and activities that are tailored for each community. Nutritious, homemade meals served in our beautiful dining rooms provide multiple opportunities each day for socialization -- a vast contrast to many seniors who are isolated in their homes.Each community strives to offer a relaxed atmosphere of warmth and caring that promotes companionship. Qualified, caring employees are committed to serving residents and treating them with dignity and respect.
Our Philosophy
We believe residents should be able to choose an affordable lifestyle that is best suited for them.We offer the following levels of service:Independent Living is for Capital Senior residents who do not require assistance. Our residents want community and friends in a comfortable location where they also can receive support services such as housekeeping, courtesy transportation and recreation and wellness programs for their lifestyle. Our communities are staffed 24 hours a day.Assisted living is available for residents who want extra help but don’t need the more intensive services provided in a nursing home. Assisted living residents can receive help with medication management, bathing, dressing, grooming and mobility.Many of our communities offer Memory Care services to aid with early dementia or Alzheimer’s. These services foster residents’ individual skills and interests in an environment that helps to diminish confusion and agitation. We provide specialty programming in a secure environment with specially trained professionals skilled in handling the behavior associated with memory impairments.Access to home care expands the range of services offered to our residents. We can bridge the gap between Independent Living and Assisted Living services.We refer to our services as a continuum of care. If there are changes in need, Capital Senior Living residents use only the services they want and pay only for those they use. With that continuum of care, residents can stay in their apartment homes without having to seek new facilities.  

Our Core Values
Capital Senior Living employees are dedicated to providing the best care available in the senior housing industry. We are committed to:

Providing value.
Advocating the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of our residents in a dignified manner. 
Maintaining resident satisfaction and quality of life while maximizing short- and long-term shareholder value. 
Adhering to sound business principles that provide a suitable environment for our residents and colleagues.

Being active locally and nationally in industry organizations. 
Growing our company in a logical and prudent manner.
