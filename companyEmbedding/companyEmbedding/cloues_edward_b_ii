			Mr. Cloues has served as a director of the Company since April 2010. He is a director and non-executive Chairman of the Board of AMREP Corporation (a real estate and media services company), where he is a member of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Resources Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. He previously was a director (from 2001) and Chairman of the Board (from May 2011) of Penn Virginia Corporation (an oil and gas exploration and development company) and served as the interim Chief Executive Officer (from October 2015 to September 2016), during the reorganization of that company, including a filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in May 2016 and the emergence from Chapter 11 in September 2016 pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization. He previously served as a director (from January 2003) and as the non-executive Chairman of the Board (from July 2011) of PVR GP, LLC, which was the general partner of PVR Partners, L.P. (a pipeline and natural resources master limited partnership), until its sale in March 2014. He also previously served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of K-Tron International, Inc. ("K-Tron") from January 1998 until the Company acquired K-Tron in April 2010. Prior to joining K-Tron, Mr. Cloues was a senior partner of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, which is one of the world's largest law firms. He has been a member of and chaired audit, compensation, and nominating committees and has substantial experience with corporate governance issues. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Virtua Health, Inc. (a non-profit hospital and healthcare system), where he is a Board officer, chairs the Audit Committee, and serves on the Compensation Committee and the Finance and Investment Committee.

 

The Company's Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Cloues should serve as a director based on his past extensive legal experience as a law firm partner specializing in business law matters, particularly in the area of mergers and acquisitions, and his experience as Chairman and CEO of K-Tron International, Inc. prior to its acquisition by the Company in 2010.
